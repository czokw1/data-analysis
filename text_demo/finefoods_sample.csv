1.0,Didn't Grow. Went Moldy.,"I'm not sure what I did wrong... but I watered it once and followed the directions and waited for it to grow and nothing happened. It simply got fuzzy, and didn't sprout.  After reading the reviews (I wish I had ahead of my purchase) I see it turned moldy for other people as well."
1.0,"Great food, but purchase from local store for A LOT less","As 2 others have stated you can get the 32 packs from Wal-Mart for about $12-13. You also do have the variety of choosing different flavors and different textures like the pate or shreds. My older and younger cats would rather eat the shredded or meat bits then the mashed pate thing, and I think they don't have such a strong smell as the pate does either!  If you do not mind paying double then go for it, but I am always searching for the lowest price and knowing that Amazon is usually cheaper thought I could find them on here, but that is obviously not true in this case! Better just to buy some when you're at the store. At the store it is about .42 per can and at what I have been seeing on here it is about .78 -.80. So if you're like me and don't go to Wal-mart all that often or even if you do, best just to stock up on a few cases and save quite a bit of money!"
1.0,"Product is fine, dodgy seller?","The Lavazza Gran Crema pods are fine if you're not too fussed about good coffee, or if you're using them for latte or other milk drinks. My main issue with these was how they came from the seller. The product description clearly states that the pods come in a ""20 pack box"" - this was important to me as I keep my pods on the bench in their display boxes. Instead, my 20 pods came loose in a zip lock bag and each one was clearly marked - not for individual sale. The seller obviously buys these in bulk and then on-sells them for a larger profit - very dodgy."
5.0,"A sweet, healthy treat","Low sugar, low fat, a measured amount, and sweet and chocolatey enough to satisfy my evening sweet tooth cravings."
1.0,NOT BERRY... or CHERRY  90% APPLE,AVOID unless you want apple...( product held 90% apple) with less then 14  bitty bits of cherry or berry. If you desire BERRY try the CRUNCHIES freeze dried truly all berry!( if ZERO stars were available this would be a zero...good idea if it really were CHERRY BERRY...so OK 1 star)
5.0,Great product,"Old Wessex Scottish style porridge oats has been my favorite oatmeal since I first tried it 9 years ago. It does not have the gummy consistency of other oatmeal and I prefer its flavor to others.  I've been eating oatmeal for 60 years now and I think I can speak as ""one who knows good oats."" These are good oats. Also, buying it as a club member makes my favorite oatmeal even more affordable.  I used to drive 80 miles to stock up.  Amazon sure has made my shopping a lot easier."
5.0,Wife loves this tea,"I used to drink chamomile tea back when I was child and just needed something to settle my stomach. The blended teas of today just don't match that wonderful tea of yesteryear. However, my wife loves the honey, vanilla, chamomile combo. Like other teas we've grown to enjoy, this one is getting increasingly harder to find. Since I was ready to reorder my Stash brand Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, it made sense to buy this at the same time. Surprisingly, even though both were ordered at the same time, this came separately even though both are being sold & shipped by Amazon. I am still waiting for the Stash tea."
1.0,Not for true grits lovers,"The dry product is extremely fine, almost powdery. The cooked product is mushy and doesn't even taste like grits to me. I like the coarse stone ground grits which haven't been de-germed. Regular white grits from the grocery store is preferable to this product. I will donate the three unopened boxes to our local food bank."
5.0,Heather In Michigan,"Everyone ate this pizza as if nothing were different from regular pizza! (and I make a good scratch crust, if I do say so.) I threw some extra spices in the sauce to cover up any potential funny taste, but it wsn't needed! The edges of the crust were delicious, as well! The crust was even crispy on the botton thanks to the pre-cooking! Thank goodness we dont have to adjust our pizza eating now that we have a GF eater in the house!"
5.0,Excellent Sweet Taste,"This is NOT a hot (hot) sauce that is cruddy on flavor for the sake of heat.  This is a hot (hot) sweet BBQ sauce. I love adding this to anything with BBQ.  From a heat standpoint, I am a ""huge"" fan of Tabasco. I can't eat pasta, salsa, bloody marys, etc... without it.  This is a lot hotter than Tabasco, but a lot sweeter. I now keep Tabasco and Bone Suckin Sauce-Habanero on hand and I am a very happy dude."
5.0,Unique savory flavor,I've tried all the vegetarian Taste of Thai boxed noodle products and all the vegetarian Annie Chun noodle bowls. This is by far the best and one of the few in which the sauce combines with the noodles to create a unique flavor. It's deeply savory (umami) and unlike most anything I've tasted as a vegetarian. I could eat these every day.
1.0,Bread Mix,"Not a good bread mix. No flavor, no raisins and definitely nooooooo.......hazelnuts that i could find."
5.0,Dog loves it!!,"Great training aid. Very easy to use.  My puppy will follow this Lickety Stik anywhere!  After a while, just shaking the container gets her running to me."
5.0,Great Coffee,I purchased this coffee as a gift for my mother and it arrived well before the estimated delivery date. I was told the coffee was definitely fresh which can sometimes be a challenge when trying to buy Jaimaican Blue Mountain coffee. It was just as good as the Blue Mountain coffee that I had brought back from Jamaica quite a few years ago. Great coffee from and would recommend purchasing from this reseller if looking to purchase Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee.
1.0,I will not take a chance with my dogs health,"My dogs love the taste of it. my worry is the next day one of them vomit the entire food he just ate plus the one from the previous day. I have to said I did not gradually change to this food, so maybe that is the reason. but I notice lots of urine more than normal. I just don't feel comfortable feeding this food to my dogs."
1.0,too much pepper!,"This is just awful soup with so much black pepper, I nearly choked on it.  It had a burnt taste.  Very poor quality control on this item.  I was shocked because this brand's chicken broth is very good."
1.0,Open bag and stale chips,"I ordered 3 bags, because they came as a pack. When the box arrived 1 of them was open (I assume because they shipped it via air and the pressure made it explode) and it had spilled all over the box so I had to throw those away. The 2nd bag I opened was stale, so I couldn't use those either. I wasted my money on this purchase unfortunately."
5.0,LOVE THIS COMPANY,"I've puchased several items from this company and have been pleased with all of them.  Expensive, yes.  but I give them out as ""party favors"" for dogs that have boarded with me.  We Board Labs."
5.0,Might be the best chips I've ever had,"These are REALLY terrific, crunchy and flavorful with no artificial taste.  Not only might the be the best chips I've ever eaten, I'm wondering if they're the best FOOD I've ever eaten.  If Amazon would start carrying my beloved Apple Beer I could quit going to the grocery store entirely."
5.0,"Not bitter, just like cola","After discovering the San Pellegrino product line, I did a search and happened upon this particular product. After reading some of the reviews, I was intrigued and just had to try it. Now, having tried it, I don't understand the reviews at all. Perhaps it's just an example of how very different people's taste buds are. But this product, to me, is not the least bit bitter. It is quite sugary (sugar is the second ingredient listed, next to water). It does not taste at all lemony or like orange. To me, it tastes very similar to China Cola, which is primarily vanilla, clove, and licorice. China Cola, tastes very similar to Coke. The only real plus to this product is that it is caffeine free... but... so is China Cola (which is expensive, but cheaper than this product), and caffeine free Coke. It does have a little bit of an aftertaste which tastes like fermented grapes... a little like a wine cooler, and this aftertaste goes away very quickly. Not bad. It is good. But nothing special. If they bottled it state side, and therefore would be much cheaper, I would buy more often. But, all in all... it's a good drink.. ok, not bitter,... very sugary though."
5.0,Senseo Paris French Vanilla Bistro Coffee Pods,Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee pods are easy to use and easy to clean up. The pods brew a very flavorful cup of coffee. French Vanilla is one of my favorites.
5.0,a hoilistic health coach,"My vanilla bean plant is awesome. It came to me in perfect condition, very healthy. Do you know that this is an orchid?  It grows in soil, unlike orchids and it is the only orchid that produces a product other than flowers. I have recommended others to purchase one of these plants!"
5.0,DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE!,It's more expensive than most other coffees.  Once you try it you won't be able to go back.  It's that good.
5.0,My Secret to Surving Winter!,"I live in Atlanta and while most don't think of the winter here as harsh, I was born over 500 miles south so its practically the arctic to me. Since moving here I have used hot tea as a winter comfort. For years I drank  Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)  which was strong and had lots of flavor but left a slight metallic aftertaste. I stumbled on  Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)  and for awhile, this strong tea with less of a metallic aftertaste was my favorite. But my wife brought home this Vanilla Chai tea and I think I have found my all time favorite. It is a traditional back tea with vanilla and other spices that added together are out of this world. I perfer it to the herbal teas I have tried because it has that underlying true black tea taste. I drink it with half and half, it has so much flavor it doesn't need sweetening although traditional chai teas are served very sweet. Try this tea and see what you have been missing!"
1.0,BEWARE - AMAZON LIMITS THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU CAN BUY,"The food is GREAT.  The cats have gotten completely addicted to it.  BUT....what Amazon doesn't bother to mention is that ""quantities are limited"".  I have been buying this food for my 3 cats for about 6 months.  It comprises roughly half their diet (or 3 cats/day).  I just went to re-order and was repeatedly told ""there's a problem"".  Long story, and 2 phone calls plus 2 emails later, I was told I have bought the LIFETIME MAXIMUM of this product.  I ordered it for almost twice the price via the marketplace, but I am furious with Amazon.  NOWHERE on this page do they tell you there's a limit.  So I'm here to tell you there is.  The food is great, but don't get used to buying it here."
5.0,Love the flavor,This is a naturally sweeter tea that doesn't require extra sugar.  The taste is wonderful with dessert or before bed (naturally caffeine-free).  Just love the taste of this tea.
5.0,Amazing Product,"I ordered these for a part of a bridal shower favor (with a mug, tea, and biscotti).  These were the perfect complement and everyone loved them! The Madhava Honey Sticks are a great value (definitely the lowest priced item of this type that I found), but they also are an all around great product!  The honey is delicious and pure tasting, no plastic taste that I have had happen with other honey sticks. I definitely recommend!!"
1.0,Melted chocolate,I received my first box and when I opened it the chocolate had been melted. It was no longer smooth and creamy as Lindt truffles usually are. The weather had been cold and I accepted the package directly from the post women so I assumed it had arrived that way. I called Amazon and they gave me a replacement box which arrived in 2 days. Unfortunately it had also been melted and at that point I just gave up. I have two boxes of yucky chocolate.  I'm assuming that they melted while they sat around at amazon or Lindt provided a sub par product.  Do not order these. Buy them somewhere where you can inspect them first.
1.0,Warning new taste now 7 grams of sugar!,"Watch out for the new ""better"" taste.  They added 5 more grams of sugar.  It's no longer a healthy cereal."
5.0,Awesome Gluten-Free Pasta Brand,"All of Tinkyada's pasta is pretty wonderful.  I can't tell you how many Gluten-free pasta brands I have tried and at best they have been gross!  Finally, I found Tinkyada and I have never been disappointed.  I think this is my absolute favorite Tinkyada type (the Fusilli), but I also love the fettucini, the lasagna noodles, the elbows and shells."
5.0,"Oh Good, Another Shipment Arrived Today","This is my third order from Amazon for this product. When I decided to go wheat free a few months ago I knew I had to come up with an acceptable pancake mix because I LOVE pancakes. Since I'd used Bisquick for many years my first experiment was naturally to go with their gluten-free product. It was okay but nothing to brag about. I still have a partial box left over that I use sometimes as a coating for fish or chicken.  So I got to looking some more and kept coming across reviews for Pamela's Baking & Pancake Mix. There were a lot of positive reviews so I gave it a shot and have been very satisfied. Blueberry pancakes almost every morning. No kidding! I use milk instead of water (water and pancakes just don't seem right together to me) and add lots of blueberries and a couple tablespoons of chia seed. For the oil I use coconut oil. My wife made some chocolate chip cookies with it and they were pretty excellent too. Now that the weather is getting cooler, we'll be experimenting more.  I've recommended this mix to several family members and others and they are on board with it. Most of them are not on gluten-free diets but agree that it's a healthy alternative to wheat-based products. My wife and I and our two adult children are also not gluten intolerant.  The only negative I have about this product is the packaging. The three bags may be shipped in frustration-free packaging but the packages themselves are not frustration-free. I usually give up trying to pinch the seals together and just fold the top over. But still, this is five-star in my book. I did find this mix at a local grocery store but by ordering it though Amazon I saved about ten dollars for three bags."
5.0,forget the milk. Try honey!,"Tastes dry and dense with milk, so I experimented and found that if you eat it in a bowl with some honey (however amount depending on your preference), it's delicious!- the healthiest ""granola"" ever!!  makes for an absolutely wholesome, DELICIOUS snack.  I think the one with almonds is best!"
5.0,Love it!,"Love the Torani coconut syrup.  I use it in coffee drinks.  Some coffee, ice, milk, chocolate, and syrup.  No sugar needed.  Enough sweetness comes with the syrup.  Perfect!"
5.0,Best matcha quality and price,"I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha's products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase."
1.0,Not very good panforte,"Glucose syrup and sulphur dioxide were not ingredients at the time of the crusades.  This might technically be called panforte, but it does not taste good - flavors and spices are lame.  Probably carelessly industry-produced.  I will not be purchasing this again.  Is it even really Italian?  If you've ever eaten it in Italy, panforte is delicious, but this stuff does not even come close."
1.0,This is not gluten free.,Why is this in the Gluten Free store? Read the ingredients.  It contains wheat.  It might be a great product but it should not be in this listing. Please remove it and the other Helper products.  They all seem to contain wheat.  If you don't have celiac disease you can disreguard this complaint.
5.0,Crawford Garibaldi Biscuits,I was very satisfied with the Crawford Garibaldi Biscuits. They taste better than the Sunshine fruit buscuits that are no longer manufactured in the United States.
1.0,NO REAL PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,BUYING THIS ITEM WITH NO PRODUCT DESCRIPTION IS LIKE SIGNING A BLANK CHECK. ONLY A MORON WOULD DO THAT
5.0,Just My Kind of Coffee,"Coffee Masters Hazelnut coffee used to be carried in a local coffee/pastry shop, which is where I fell in love with it.  Then they went out of business and I tried for so long to locate it elsewhere, finally finding it at Amazon.  It is a mild coffee with a lovely flavor and aroma.  I used to mix it half and half with regular coffee, but now drink it 100% by itself 100% of the time.  Got on the auto ship plan and couldn't be happier."
5.0,The Best Stuff!,I just want to comment-I have been buying this waffle mix since my husband tasted it at a free hotel breakfastseveral years ago. Amazon is the only place I could find it and such a great price! It is our favorite!
1.0,Causes migraines and doesnt work,"So yeah, it kept me awake..... Only to give me a huge migraine. Thanks five hour energy... Everyday? How about never... I'm in terrible pain from a QUARTER OF A BOTTLE"
1.0,Nothing Like I Remember,I love vanilla milk and can't find the mix around where I live so I ordered it. I read somewhere that it is only made in New Mexico now and sure enough the writing on the package was all written in Spanish. That may or may not have anything to do with why I didn't like it.  I think that this product tasted like vanilla slimfast shakes. I cannot stand slimfast so I was so disappointed. My daughter loves this mix though so it won't go to waste im sure.
5.0,I love this product,We love these marshmallows becuase they have no pork products in them. I don't like the fat free brand though.
5.0,Good Candy,Used this as a part of my sister in laws 'candy bar' at her bridal shower and these were very popular. They tasted great and were a great price for the quantity received.
5.0,kraft tangy italian spaghetti dinner,"I think the kraft spaghetti is great, my kids had never had it and they also liked it. It was a great price with free shipping we will be ordering it again!! thank You, Julie Silva"
1.0,"Amaranth, the useless grain.","It seems I have been dupt! Amaranth does not pop like popcorn,cook up like oatmeal ot make a nice side dish like Quinoa.  I have looked and looked but I cannot find anything to do with it.  Gnosses"
5.0,so good,I normally prefer Starbucks pumpkin lattes to Dunkin donuts' but these kcups are amazing!  Won't have to make my daily Starbucks visit!
5.0,Yummy!,"If you want great granola, look no further.  I live in Utah and none of the stores carry it so I have to mail order my granola to get something good!"
5.0,Great New Favours!,"I was surprised when the box arrived, I didn't know there would be so many new and exciting favours. The Sweet potato was really good, as was the Thai Style, the Jalape&ntilde;o packets were OK."
1.0,Clever Way to Hide MSG,"dried autolyzed yeast extract = MSG  If you want to find out if there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in a product, you must ask the manufacturer for information about ""free glutamic acid.""  Don't ask about ""MSG.""  Manufacturers find it convenient, when speaking to consumers, to tell them that there is no ""MSG"" in their product, meaning that there is no ingredient called ""monosodium glutamate.""  Even if a manufacturer tells you there is no MSG in a product, there may be autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed pea protein, carrageenan, sodium caseinate, enzymes, and a whole slew of other ingredients that contain or create processed free glutamic acid (MSG) during manufacture.  If you are told that all of the MSG in a product is ""naturally occurring,"" thank the manufacturer for that meaningless information, but explain that all processed free glutamic acid (MSG) is referred to as ""natural"" by the FDA -- so ""natural"" tells you nothing.  In fact, as the word ""natural"" is defined by the FDA, the food ingredient ""monosodium glutamate"" is ""natural.""  It is the amount of processed free glutamic acid in the product that will determine whether or not you might suffer an MSG reaction. (Everyone has a different tolerance for MSG.) If the manufacturer claims not to know whether or not there is processed free glutamic acid (MSG) in his or her product, ask that the product be analyzed for free amino acids, including free glutamic acid. There are tests for measuring free glutamic acid. The AOAC Official Methods of Analysis (1984) gives one method. There are others. The cost of testing should be no more than $150.  We have been advised by the FDA that if any such misbranded products are brought to their attention, they will act to correct the situation. To report misbranded products to the FDA, please call the FDA at 888-723-3366 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., eastern time - and keep a record of your call."
5.0,Great taste,It is hard to find this product in the store and when I do it is very expensive. This product is exactly the brand I buy but at a much better price.
1.0,do NOT buy this! NEVER NEVER NEVER,"My gf bought this for me not knowing what's in the basket.  First of all, instead of that frog you see in the picture, a cheap one dollar store stuffed animal came.  And, snacks they put in the basket would cost you no more than $10, even if you buy them at overpriced convenience stores.  They put some cheap looking imitation snacks that looked like Doritos, and they were from ""golden flakes"", a brand that i've never seen or heard.  WORST OF ALL, I found a live COCKROACH inside the shipping box that contained this gift!!!  It was huge.  Seriously, I was going to take a picture to share customer image on amazon page, but it was just too gross.  I feel so bad for my gf who was such a sucker to buy this crap."
1.0,Horrible Product and Company,I ordered this product for our vacation home in Colorado. We arrived in Colorado December 16th and this coffee maker stoped working January 3rd. It is now January 13th and I have yet to talk to someone from the company after being put on hold for over 40 minutes 4 different times. I love the concept of the K-Cup but they need to fix the water pump on this machine and fix the way they handle customer service and returns.
1.0,Got a disease and died,We don't like these Hawaiian umbrellas. We have had 3 and 2 (including this one) have caught some sticky fungus and died. We will not buy another.
5.0,A healthy and refreshing drink,"This drink packs a taste wallop, which continues some time after you have swallowed the last drop. Furthermore, there is no unpleasant aftertaste, what you feel at the beginning is what you taste at the end. The taste is also a good one, the apple, grape, acerola and cherry juices in combination with the carbonated water really activates the taste buds. I also found it refreshing with no sugar or caffeine buzz arriving a few minutes after I consumed it. A healthy drink, I will continue to drink it in the future."
1.0,American Kennel Club Chicken Poppers,"One would assume that American kennel club chicken poppers would be manufatured in the United States, however these are not made in the usa. Had to return the product."
5.0,terrific marinade,"This is hands-down the easiest and tastiest marinade I've ever used.  My whole family and many families in our area buy it from local stores.  It is strong so a little goes a long way.  My husband had never had it before we married and now he wants it in every pot roast with vegetables and in hamburgers. When making pot roast, I water it down a little which makes it a little less strong but still tenderizes the meat and provides water for the vegetables. I love it on fish and chicken.  Our cabinet is never without it.  Thanks, Allegro!"
5.0,Most excellent,"Very good taste,Not hard like most others that I have tried. Real beef!! A real good soft and chewy treat! Nice mild flavor. Go ahead try them,,"
5.0,These are great!,These crackers are delish! I love them with a wedge of light laughing cow cheese on top. I wish they were more affordable. My local health food store sells them for $4.75 per package.
1.0,"""I'd Rather Fight Than Switch""","To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.  There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?  This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.  ""Switch"" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.  If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep."
5.0,RedButterfly,"I simply LOVE this tea! It is yummy, full of flavor and the best part is the caffeine! I really love Yogi brand tea, but it could get a big expensive at retail or grocery stores, so the bulk prices on Amazon are perfect for customers like me that drink tea daily! Shipping was a breeze, as always!"
5.0,Great item,"Its getting harder and harder to find these around town where I live. Great items, I agree with the other review that after a while the smell is terrible. However its a small price to pay. Both my dogs love their hooves. I have a coon hound and cocker spaniel/beagle mix. They will chew on the hooves for hours."
1.0,"Like was said, smells and tastes like grass","OK, so please do not consider this a negative review of Davidson's Tea in general.  I guess tea is like anything else, there are some who will like a particular tea and some who won't.  As you can see, there are other reviewers who like this tea a lot.  Another reviewer hit it right on the head, ""smells like grass"".  It does in fact smell like grass.  I don't want that.  I am ignorant of what a green tea should taste like and I am sure this is the proper smell and taste for this tea and that as green rooibos goes it will be better than other because Davidson's teas usually are, but like my dad told me about Gin-and-Tonics when I was a we one who snuck a sip while he pretended not to be looking, ""it is an aquired taste son"".  I give it 1 star because I personnaly don't like it, not because it is wrong in how it tastes or smells.  Hail Flavius!"
1.0,beer bread,"We all know how much we love the cable company.  Well, they have spread out to new grounds with the same care and quality that we all pay thru the nose for.  Larry should stick to cable and see if he can perfect that before doing anything else.  Hell, his beer bread cost me a good can of beer.  We always bought beer bread at Traders Joe's but they stopped selling it.  This was a very bland substitute!"
5.0,Go to smucker's site,"You can order a box of 3, 6, 8 and 12 bags of this coffee (in season) for a reasonable price  (~$8 per bag)  http://onlinestore.smucker.com/display_category.cfm?cat_id=86&viewall=0&pg=1"
5.0,Great Product,My dog is 11 years old and has a bad back. He is a VERY picky eater.  He LOVES these treats and asks for them if we forget to give him one. (Which is seldom because he is so spoiled) There is a bit more of a perk in his step since we've discovered this product. The cost here on Amazon is fantastic too because the stores have been charging me $7.99 a bag. (NYC prices yikes)
5.0,What a sweet treat!,Excellent flavor!! This stevia is so good that I signed on to Subscribe and Save--I use it in tea every day and I can't imagine getting tired of it.
5.0,Great Catnip Seeds,I've been very happy with these catnip seeds. They grew with beautiful white flowers that decorated my garden. I'm very impressed with these seeds. They only take about a week to grow.
5.0,best gummy snack ive ever had,these are my favorite gummy snack of all time. every flavor is awesome but there's only 3 but who cares there delicious!  these are very hard to find in stores the only place i can find them is at a grocery store in those open bin things in the candy area and there always dried out. these however are the freshest gummy octopus's ive every had and i couldn't be happier.  shipping from candy nation was fast (3 days) and candy was very fresh
5.0,AWESOME Went out of their way to get a gift on time!,This was the best Customer Service! They went out of their way to get a birthday gift to our customer on time!
5.0,Saccharin is great,"I've used saccharin tablets for many years, but the recent ""new"" sugar substitutes seem to have driven saccharin tablets off the shelves of all the local supermarkets. I'm pleased to find this product at Amazon as it is a vendor I'm comfortable with. Apparently, if you prefer to use saccharin as a sugar substitute, this is the place to get it."
5.0,The best instant coffee!,"Absolutely the best instant coffee in the market. Through Amazon.com the price is unbeateable. I subscribe for every six months orders and have experienced delivery on time each time, plus discounts. Both the caffeinated and uncaffeinated are mellow and need no cream to enjoy its full flavor."
1.0,Sone Ugly Added Spice That Looks Like Mouse Droppings,"I ended up throwing this one away mid-way because I kept picking brown mouse like droppings out of my mouth. I inspected it to see what it could be, likely just a spice they added, but the chunks were big, and seeing that they looked just like mouse poop, I could not continue on and finish it.  Its a shame because the soup itself tastes great... however I cannot get past the spice things they added. They looked far too much like rodent droppings."
5.0,Special Tea,"This is one of my favourite teas now that I've found it.  Absolutely delicious. Blackberry fruity with a hint of maple.  Great tea in a wonderful wooden box that could be used again. Would be great iced, but is also excellent hot."
1.0,Very Over Sold,"From the product write-up, you'd think this company dries the world's most flavorful onions and ships them to the customer the same day.  What I got was a container of what seemed to be stale, flavorless micro-minced onions.  You get the onion burn, if you eat a full tablespoon, alone (I did), but none of the fragrance and other rich flavor that a good dried onion must have."
1.0,RiceWorks has lost its taste,"I used to love the Sweet chili Riceworks but they must have change the recipe. It doesn't taste as good. Also, although the chip bags came in a box, the chips had been crushed. I will not/not buy them again."
5.0,Great Pie Filling,"I love this Pie filling! I am a Diabetic and it is heard to find a filling that won't max out my Numbers or make me sick. This one worked all the way around. When used as the Directions say I had six good servings of CHERRY Pie, and did not have High Numbers in the morning."
1.0,too bad,"It's sad, but unless you like artificial sweetener a whole lot, this won't be for you any more than it was for me."
5.0,Best ever!!!,These pine nuts were so good that I am buying another 3 pounds.  Definitely the best I have ever tasted.
5.0,MmmmmmMINT!,"MMmmmmmMINT Matcha is JUST what I needed to help round off my matcha supply!  I love mint but need to be in the mood for it. Luckly for me that mood comes fairly often!  Mint is eye opening, awakening, and also helps soothe a troubled tummy.  We had some really good Japanese food last night at a great restaurant but all of us were having some tummy ""issues"" last evening after dinner. This mornings mint matcha is really helping to settle the tummy woes.  When I opened my bag from Red Leaf Tea the aroma was striking! I instantly thought ""ohhhh yessss this is IT"". It had some slight resemblance to Spearmint gum, and while I do detect a slight peppermint flavor here I would have to say the mint used is mostly spearmint. For those who know their mints some really prefer one type of mint over another. Spearmint to me is sweeter than peppermint and there is less of a bite to it. Some may beg to differ since most people are used to peppermint candies but in its true form I find peppermint to have more bite, sharper than spearmint and spearmint more sweet naturally. Regardless of what type of mint you prefer I have to say this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf does in fact taste very natural!  Yet at the same time it is an excellent mixer as well. Of course you will want to use a little less mint matcha in your blend along with another matcha but I choose to blend mint with mocha this morning. The mocha I used a full scoop and the mint just a half of a scoop. I can taste the mocha very well and the mint does not totally over power it.  This mint does not in any way taste like mouth wash or toothpaste. It is quite enjoyable. I am so glad that I purchased this one and will absolutely keep this as a stash regular.  Also I notice that the mocha base is providing a nice creamy backdrop to the mint matcha! Ohhhh I MUST try a french vanilla / mint blend as soon as possible - I am thinking ""Grasshopper"" flavored matcha here! Oh yeah!  So all in all I could not be happier that I went for it and grabbed this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf!"
1.0,I expected better,"My mother-in-law, my adult children, my wife and I all tried this and quite frankly all thought it was just plain bad bad bad.You could taste liquid smoke in it and it didn't resemble Jalapeno flavor at all.  I was really disappointed.  I still go to Taco Bell even if the news said they didn't have beef in their tacos because I like the taste of what I get.  Some people gave this product a 5 star rating but I'm sorry but my panel of experts (;-), say no way Jose."
1.0,Horrible,"Not only does this gum smell like cough syrup, it tastes like it too. Disgusting.  Ad for the fruit taste, its there for a very short time before turning into a stiff ball of gum."
5.0,Handspresso HP intense portafilter,I already own the handpresso traveling kit and it probably is one of the best gadgets I have ever owned  When we are traveling it is so nice to have access to good coffee so when I saw this item and read what it did I naturally had to have it its kind of like a update for the handpresso unit I cant wait to try it out there are going to be some jealous people around when they smell the fresh espresso (LOL)
5.0,I LOVE THIS COFFEE!!!,"New Orleans is one of my favorite cities in the world. Everytime I go, Cafe DuMonde is a must....as I travel and sample coffees around the world, I realize that this is coffee can hold its own. I am sorry they don't sell the beans so I can grind my own...but I love the smoky rich flavor. Really great coffee!!! I can bring a little of Louisiana everywhere I go. Thanks!!"
5.0,Great product!!,I really like the taste of these bars. They are convenient as a breakfast or snack item. I keep coming back for more!!
1.0,Cachou Lajaunie Licorice,YUK!  I threw it away.  I guess it is an aquired taste.  I love black licorice and thought this would be a could way to have it without to many calories.
5.0,Excellant Hazelnut flavor for coffee,I prefer hazelnut flavored coffee and used instant Taster's Choice brand until they stopped packaging it in the 6 or 7 oz canisters.  After experimenting with various flavoring agents I found this Torani syrup to fill the bill.  Don't add any sugar or sweetener as the syrup is already sweet.  Personally I am very happy with the results.  I have my hazelnut instant coffee again at a reasonable price.
5.0,Outstanding spices!,"Chef Paul spices are simply the best! Paul Prudhomme is one of my favorite chefs, a real genius with foods.  His spices will make any backyard chef a master. I've not had anyone not remark on how good the steaks, chicken, fish, pork, or shrimp is.  I tried finding it in grocery stores, and it was a waste of time. Buy it on Amazon. I ordered it in the larger packages, and it's economical that way."
5.0,Outstanding taste!,"Great product!  I've always loved these crackers and was delighted to find them so affordable here. Sorry to see they've now become too expensive to buy, though."
5.0,Best Instant Ever,"This is the best instant coffee I have ever tried and I have tried so many brands, I even prefer it to brewed coffee. Very tasty with great aroma and rich coffee flavor."
5.0,Hershey's cinnamon chips...a little piece of heaven!!!,If you are looking for something to change up the chocolate rut....this is your product!!  They are tasty and are high quality.  Make a delightful snickerdoodle bread!!!  Shipping was amazingly quick!!!  I reordered a double box with the same quick shipping results!!!  They arrived in less than 1 week!
1.0,"Did not ship the brand listed, and got 3 cans of Hot instead of the variety pack.","After searching reviews on amazon, I chose to order this brand due to name recongnition and high reviews on this particular brand, La Tienda. The picture shows 3 cans of La Tienda, but what you get is another brand entirely: some brand called SPP, different tin, different label, different brand. Not affiliated whatsoever with La Tienda. Futhermore, the picture clearly shows a variety pack- one can of HOT one can of SWEET and one can of BITTERSWEET. I got three cans of HOT.  Since the packaging is entirely in spanish, I cannot discern if this is a reputable brand or producer, nor can I know if this brand is a cheap substitute for the brand I thought I was getting. Since I am not an expert on Spanish Smoked Paprika, I decided to just go with a seemingly well known brand and not take a chance on a brand I never heard of. For all I know this could be a store brand or generic and not produced to the standards of the brand he is advertising.  Seller needs to take down the picture and relist with what you are actually getting. If you are brand conscious, go elsewhwere. The brand I received, ""SPP"" is not being sold by any one on amazon, and I can't actually find ANY information about this brand at all."
1.0,Just go to the store! Please read1,"Ok so I was doing some research to find good deals on formula. I am not sure if many of you know, but if you go to the Similac website and sign-up to be a Similac mom they will send you frequent coupons in the mail. Not just any coupons kiddos. $5.00 off of any sized Similac formula as long as it does not cost less than 5 bucks. My baby is 2 weeks old and I have gotten these coupons in the mail twice already. 7 coupons in total. That is a lot of saving!Also, a huge plus is when you can use double coupons. Stack store coupons with the manufacturer coupons. This will help you save a lot of dough. Good luck and I hope this was helpful."
5.0,The best stuff,I love the White Chocolate Mohcas at Starbucks but don't always have time to get them or the desire to always have to drive there and wait in line for it.  My husband bought me the Tassimo machine and I found these here on Amazon to make my white mochas at home.  This sauce is amazing and the mochas I make at home are just as good if not better than the ones at Starbucks.  I always had problems getting them consistently good and it depended on the barista who was making them how they would turn out.  Now they are delicious every time and I don't have to leave home to get one.  Just make sure you read the details that this needs to be refrigerated once opened.  I haven't used it in anything but mochas or regular coffee so far but I am looking forward to trying it on various other things.  I'm on my 3rd bottle already and I just bought it less than 2 months ago.  I drink mochas at least 4 times a week now.
1.0,"Junk Food a la ""health food""","Brown rice ""milk"" is not actually made from rice, but from sweetener made from rice. It is a form of ""malt"" sugar. Insulin up the wazoo. Avoid products like these."
1.0,very disappointed,"I received this product today. It was going to be a gift for my office staff. All of the pears were bruised and fruit looked like something I could have purchased from the grocery store myself for half the price.  There were no blocks of cheese, as pictured. Instead there was a wheel of Laughing Cow cheese and one sleeve of crackers.  This product was absolutely not worth what is being charged and I would not consider purchasing products from this vendor again."
1.0,Not So Smart,Ingredients: High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Oil.  Do a search and see what you think. I won't touch this stuff.
5.0,I love this BBQ sauce. Perfect for stocking stuffers. Thanks Amazon!!,"Great tasting sauce..Appeals to most taste buds!! I too used Cattlemen's, buying it @ Walmart until they stopped carrying it. Finally found it on Amazon and wanted to order a larger bottle but at the time just the 18 oz was available. Bought several six packs and then got the idea to add one to my gift stockings for friends & family. 18 oz plastic bottle is a perfect fit. My six packs arrived safe and sound. Thank, Amazon. sacee"
1.0,Gas and fart generator!!!,"This is the first time I have so much gas and fart after eating a cake. Two hours after the meal, it's almost guaranteed that I start to suffer and it lasts for the entire day. My wife has the same symptom and so it is certain. So uncomfortable."
1.0,Better do it from scratch,"As much as I LOVE NordicWare pans, I was completely disappointed by the mixes. Apple Spice did not even get out of the pan, completely ruining my party And Zesty Lemon took three times longer than expected, was overflowing the pan and tasted in some chemical way. So my advise - get the pans, but do the batter from scratch."
5.0,Great transition,"My baby went from the Gerber gentle to the gentle 2 with no problems.  He has done so well on this formula since he was a newborn.  I am doing both cow's milk and this, and no problems!"
5.0,Exceptional Value...Great Price...Great Amazon Service,"I simply could not beat the price on this product. It came out to a little over $1 per 100 packets, which I normally buy 100 packs for $1.50 in the grocery store, plus 8.25% sales tax. In this economy, its all about the numbers. The product tastes just like Equal to me and flavors wonderfully. The first box I received had some defective packaging resulting in the product pouring out of the packets and into the bottom of the box. Amazon quickly replaced the box of sweetener with another, which had no defective packets. Excellent service from Amazon. This is why I keep coming back...."
1.0,unhappy,This Product came with outter plastic cover removed with only 29 bars of candy in a 30 bar pack. Also came melted and reharded. (Not sure if that happend in shipping or came that way) But unsure of eating cause package came opened. *I did not make any claim since it was so cheap.
1.0,Hay is for horses,"If you've tasted real tea, then you know that Twinings tastes like hay.  Cut open the bag and look.  I think they share ingredients with Lipton;)"
1.0,Wheat/Gluten made beans inedible,"Why on Earth Eden felt it necessary to include wheat flour is beyond me; I've never met a can of beans that had flour in it before. When I read the Amazon description (kidney beans cooked in spices, japaleno etc.) there was no mention of flour. When the cans arrived...there it is at the bottom of the label -- wheat flour. I have celiac and I am unable to eat these beans. Very disappointed that wheat flour was not mentioned on the product page as it is such an unusual addition."
5.0,product discontinued,"I have just been told by 'back to NATURE' that this has been discontinued.  We started noticing that it was disappearing from shelves all over our area about 2 months ago. We asked every place to check for availability, yet never heard anything other than it is backordered.  I used 'back to NATURE' website to do the 'contact us' thing twice and never received a response.  I came to Amazon while searching online and placed myself on the notify when this product becomes available list.  Today I decided to try and call back to NATURE. I spoke with the person that answered the phone, she said she could help, and after discussing my difficulty finding the product she offered to 'research' and get back to me. I must note she attempted to collect quite of bit of personal information. She assured me that I could simply go back to the local groceries and ask why they were not stocking it however I insisted that it was not available anywhere nor here on Amazon so the problem was not my grocer.  I wasn't quite accepting her quick 'research, get back to me, and get of the phone approach' so I asked to talk to someone else and she got me on the line with her supervisor Lizzy.  After reviewing the above and being offered a 'research and get back' solution I was a bit more insistant and it was then that she said '.. that product had been discontinued due to a lack of sales and once discontinued it is inlikely that it will become available again...'. At this point I was more than just a bit disapointed and shared with her that in my local market the 'Cranberry Pecan Granola' just happened to be the only one of their granola selections that was always selling out, week after week over the last several years and I found it curious that the one selection that did appear to sell was discontinued.  I guess it is only popular here!"
5.0,YUMMY,"My son has multiple allergies, he's allergic to wheat, eggs, nuts, & barley..I'm one of those mom's who loves to bake..I havent found any good tasting gluten free mixes until now..I bought the cookie mix, quick bread mix, chocolate cake mix & now the coffee cake mix.. I absolutely love it.. I poured 1/2 the batter in a pan, poured some of the topping mix on top of that with cherry pie filling, then the rest of the batter & crumb topping..It was amazing.. SOoo glad I found the Cravings Place mixes."
1.0,"Been there, Done that!","This was USELESS to me and a lot of others. Difficult to set and I had no results! There is a product called ""NoMol"" it's what my EXTERMINATOR used. it's CHEAP, EFFECTIVE,but hard to find. My EXTERMINATOR trapped 10 moles last year and I've trapped 10 So Far this year! I have a lot invested in my Flower beds! these ""Criiters"" were DESTROYING them. I've tried everything from poison gummy worms to smoke bombs, Castor oil to castor beans. Gum, Bleach and contraptions like this that DO NOT WORK! Look at NoMOL on YouTUBE.... it was the ONLY thing that worked for me! The proff was always right there in that trap. 20 dead Moles..... So Far!"
1.0,do not recommend buying from amazon,"it is gatorade, what can you say ? but it is in heavy cans and when I ordered it from amazon they 3rd-partied it and the shipper put 6 big cans in a flimy box with zero protection and zero padding. when it arrived 4 of 6 cans were split and spilling dry gatorade. I had to go and buy a huge plastic tub to pour all the gatorade in before it humidified into a solid green brick. extremely dissatisfied. would NOT buy again from amazon."
5.0,angel food cake,very happy with the betty crocker angel ckae mix  can't find it any other place
5.0,Absolutely the Best Pickle in the World,"What more can I say.  I agree with everyone else.  They quit selling them in my area, Fort Worth, Texas about five years ago.  Big Lots advertized them and I bought every jar I could find at all the Big Lots stores.  But, sadly, they have been gone for a couple of years.  I look at every pickle counter in every store hoping to find them, but to no avail.  I have missed them so much and never thought of shopping on amazon. I just thought they were gone forever. My mouth is watering right now, just in anticipation of eating one.  PS:  I like mine better at room temperature, but you have to put them in the fridge after a couple of days.  OMG they do make the potato salad.  I just can't wait until I get my jars."
1.0,Dental risk,"I just spent $1,400 on dental work for my two dogs, both of whom broke multiple teeth on these bones.  The Bones do prevent tartar build-up but at an unacceptable cost.  I believe this product should carry safety warnings because the vet told us that this is a common problem with the hard bones."
5.0,senseo,this product was priced reasonably and transaction was very easy and received as promised.  I would highly recommend doing business to purchase this product.
1.0,flour,"you can buy this at any grocer for about $1, sometimes it's on sale for .69 cents. This seller must be retarded."
5.0,Love these bottles,"I keep switching back and forth between this and the organic ketchup at Trader Joe's. I keep coming back to these ones because they're easier for me to hold and squeeze, even with arthritis in my hands, and easier for my preschool daughter to use (unlike longer necked ones that she tends to have less control of, squirting ketchup everywhere!).  As far as the ketchup itself goes, it's ketchup. I'm guessing you've had it before. (If not, go to a fast food pace to get a packet to try it out. It's the same stuff.)"
5.0,Blueberry covered in dark Chocolate,"We couldn't decide which we loved more,  pomeganates or blueberries covered in dark chocolate....so we always buy BOTH!  Anti-oxidants and the heart health snack of one ounce of dark chocolate each day.  These are WONDERFUL!"
5.0,"Light flavored, earthy and refreshing!","I have always loved Lipton Superfruit teas, however this one is my new favorite. The light scents of black currant and vanilla make it one of the most earthy and refreshing teas I have ever had."
1.0,My Bad,Can't believe I chose the single box I thought I was getting a two pack! Geez double the price! Pay attention to what you order!
1.0,AWFUL,"These Olive Oil Potato Chips with Rosemary were SO GOOD at one time when produced under the name of SOLEA. I bought them frequently, first at Whole Foods then online.  They were large heavy chips that one could easily tell were cooked in Olive Oil with just enough Rosemary on them to give a great distinctive taste. Now they have been RUINED. The chips are smaller, lighter with less Olive Oil and the Rosemary is piled up at the bottom of the bag(instead of on the chips)! Oh, did I mention they are virtually TASTELESS as well?  And I have a box of 12 bags!  UGH!! David Washington, DC"
1.0,Product was damaged,"When I received this package, cocoa power was spilling out of the box.  Upon opening the box, 3 of the pods were cracked open and useless."
5.0,Best cookies ever!,After dinner I always tell my wife that I need a 'light cookie snack'.  These are the perfect solution to that request!  Simply delicious; very flavorful and highly recommended.
5.0,BEST COFFEE,No more visits to the espresso stands.  Add a little milk to the Senseo dark roast coffee and you have the BEST latte ever. (and WAAAAY cheaper and more convenient!)  Receive great raves from everyone I serve it to.
5.0,best granola,"Purely Elizabeth granolas are by far my favorite granola.  It is not too sweet, stays crunchie even in milk and I think it is the healthiest granola out there."
1.0,unsanitary packaging,"25 lbs. of hard licorice pieces were dumped into kitchen trash bags, unsealed, then put into a cardboard box.  The most disgusting, unsanitary packaging I've ever seen.  I tossed the entire thing in the trash. To top it off, the first ingredient in the whole thing was corn syrup.  Yuk. Avoid like the plague."
1.0,Greasy,"This salami was so greasy when opened it, it literary poured out grease. I tried eating on two separate occasions and gave me the runs and cramps so bad, I couldn't even go to sleep. I threw 5 and 3/4 of the salami away. The 3/4 portion I left out for the animals which roam around the neighborhood, they wouldn't even eat it. Save your money don't buy this salami."
5.0,Delicious!,"I saw a package of these STRAWBERRIED PEANUT BUTTER M&M's in the check-out line of a local grocery and decided to give them a try. I love strawberries and though I enjoy the taste now and again, I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter. The taste was delicious! They are quite high in both calories and fat, but with something this scrumptious that's to be expected.  Just don't eat too many at one time. These are supposed to be a limited time candy, but I hope Mars reconsiders and adds them as a regular candy."
1.0,Not worth it,"I have tried several coffee k-cups. From Starbucks to Moonlight coffee...virtually every kcup This coffee tastes more like chemicals. No wonder the price is so low.  Do not buy this Coffee -- sorry to say !!!  The worst coffee i ever bought and the biggest mistake i did that I bought several ones.... If anyone needs the chemical coffee , i am willing to sell it out for 50% less price"
5.0,GREAT trail mix!,"I've read some reviews that say ""a trail mix is a trail mix""...I don't think that's true.  This is a perfect balance of nuts, seeds (sunflower seeds), raisins and candy  coated chocolate pieces.  It is absolutely delicious and filling which comes in very handy, whether you've had to skip lunch or just want a snack...or even dessert.  That said, this trail mix is not too sweet; it's just sweet enough.  I also love the fact that there is a very light sprinkling of salt in there; it gets on the raisins and that adds tremendously to the flavor.  This isn't exactly low calorie but you get a lot of bang for your calorie ""buck"".  5 grams of protein per serving.  It arrived fresh and during a horrible heat wave and the chocolate was perfect.  Nothing melted.  If you get ""subscribe and save"" from Amazon you won't find better pricing anywhere (and the way I mow through these, that is a very good thing!).  I can't recommend this trail mix highly enough."
1.0,Who drinks decaf????,"Never really had a problem purchasing k cups, However, I decided I wanted more of a variety, so I went with this product. My wife and I were extremelyl disappointed to say the least. 3/4 of the k cups were different kinds of decaf coffee. I don't know about the rest of you, but I mostly drink coffee as a wake me up in the morning, not for the taste. (which I find bland). Decaf flavors should be sprinkled in here or there, not dominate the entire package."
5.0,Most flavorful teas,"A friend bragged about these teas so I decided to give this variety pack a try.  I absolutely love them, they are packed with flavor and have excellent delicate taste!  And the presentation is so beautiful!"
1.0,CRAPTASTIC!  WORST EVER! BRING BACK ORIGINAL NOW!,"Loved the original!  Hate this new recipe.  It was fine to have alternative recipes - weight control (BS BTW), less sugar.  But, to make the alternative the only option a consumer can buy??? Horrible decision and even worse product.  I could not even eat one bowl of this mess.  it is so far off the mark that I would rather go hungry than attempt to eat this crap!  My dog could make a better batch of oatmeal with some kibbles and her butt!  This product is a disgrace and should be taken off the store shelves - never allowed to return!"
1.0,Awful,"I highly recommend passing on this stuff--super saccharine taste plus the additional ""benefit"" of that awful artificial sweetener after taste.  Now what am I going to do with the remaining 23 cups?"
1.0,Disappointed.,"I received these as a Xmas gift. I was so anticipating these pistachios since I had tried ""Wonderful"" before and they were delicious. The bag that I received appeared to be over-roasted and the nuts did not taste good at all. I notified the company but as of this date I have received no response. These were a waste of money."
1.0,Bad deoderant sweaty guys,"If you're a sweaty guy this Is not the deoderant for you, i sweat in my armpits a fair amount and over a few hours this wreaks of horrid sweat and rotten deoderant, though the deoderant smells good it just stinks like rotting deoderant sweat after a couple hours."
1.0,A bagel shape does not a bagel make,"Since all the good reviews here seem to be ""Buzz Agents"" I thought I'd add my non-buzz review. These are terrible. The only resemblence to a bagel is the shape. They're basically like the heel end of a loaf of white bread with a hole cut out. The texture isn't chewy like a bagel should be (they obviously aren't boiled or steamed). Lame, lame marketing scam."
1.0,"Bugs, gross",I bought a bag of this at the health food store and when I opened it up there were small black insects all over it.  Needless to say I threw it away.  I don't know if this is a problem with the product itself or how it was stored (although the bag was unopened and I didn't see any holes). I don't think I could ever purchase this product again.
1.0,how come,how come this is listed at $88.40? how come its so small? how come i got the wrong flavor? my dog don't care but come on.
1.0,Very Disappointed,"We had some Fiesta Lemon Pepper that was salt free and we loved it.  Can't find it here in Tulsa.  Saw this at Amazon and ordered some right away. Well, this stuff is NOT salt free.  There are no ingredients listed in the product information when we ordered it.  Not only does it have salt, but it also has MSG! Tried to return the stuff, but ""not elligible"" for return.  Will probably end up throwing it away. I wouldn't even give it as a gift with MSG."
5.0,Tasty way to increase milk!,First off these cookies are very tasty!  I like that you can store them in your freezer and just take one out as needed.  I think the only problem is just eating one a day!! Of course I did that but I thought about my next cookie lol!!  So the real question is did they work for me.  Let me give you a little back story.  I've been nursing for about 21 months and my supply was really dwindling.  My little one wasn't happy about that though.  So I gave them a try and I was impressed with the increase!  Definitely  noticeable after about 3 days.  This was an easy way to boost supply rather than taking many supplements and such.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who needed a boost.  **Disclaimer - I received a sample for review purposes.  As always my thoughts are my own.  You can read the full review on Astheygrowup.com (just search for Milkmakers in the search box)***
1.0,Big Mess All Inside the Box,"I can't rate the imitation honey because it was spilled all over the inside of the box and the bottles when I received it. The lids were loose on all 12 bottles, and the security seals were not sealed. Since the security seals were broken, there is no way I would be willing to eat any of the honey. I requested a refund from Amazon because food products cannot be returned."
5.0,Vruit juice,"My 3-year-old son loves this juice! It took a while to receive the product , but it was worth the wait."
1.0,"Move along, nothing to see here.","This is a very boring tea. I was mislead by the fact that it contains chamomile. Stash makes great products, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. It tastes bitter and faintly berry sweet."
1.0,Pellet gun would be a better option.,"I purchased this as it said that it would help repel squirrels. After applying it all over the tree branches/fruit that hang over the patio that these pest sit, eat, drop fruit, defecate and urinate over (making our patio most undesirable to be around)it had absolutely no effect on repelling them. So unfortunately this item is totally useless on repelling the squirrels in our neighborhood = 1 star because there is a zero star option."
5.0,"healty, good snack.","Good Sense makes the perfect tropical trail mix; no extra ingredients that skew the taste buds ( like m&m's for example).  If not convinced, I recommend trying other brands trop mix and judge: just not up to par. This the best on the market.  But just my opinion."
1.0,Returned - Chemicals in reservoir,"I used my Beaba for the first time this week to make my 6 month old's food. There were some annoyance issues with its functionality (no beeping or alert to let you know when steaming is finished, smaller capacity which meant that one large sweet potato needed to be split into two steaming batches, and the fact that you have to hold the dial continuously during the puree stage or it turns off).  While I could probably live with those factors, I became concerned when I read reviews from other parents regarding mold and other materials in the reservoir. I got out a flashlight and decided to look at the reservoir. Although I had followed the instructions to run the machine through three steam cycles before you begin using it, the reservoir contained brown liquid spots in the bottom. I used a paper towel to try and get out the spots. The liquid was some sort of chemical lubricant.  If you wish to use this product, please make sure that you check the reservoir with a flashlight before and after each use. It seems pointless to go through the effort of making organic food for your child when the food ends up contaminated with mold or chemicals due to the Beaba's design."
1.0,Sad to say it didn't work for me....,"After my bad cholesterol hit a high of 167 my doc gave me 3 months to make some changes before we considered medications.  After some research and reading the reviews here I decided to give these chews a try.  I also cut out red meat, cheese, switched to non-fat milk and ate more produce.  I had 2 of these per day for the last 8 weeks, 1 after lunch and 1 after dinner.  I had my repeat blood work done two days ago and my bad cholesterol is now at 177....  :o(  Up 10 points in 3 months.  Glad it works for so many, but don't assume they'll work for you and don't avoid follow-up appointments with your doctor thinking you have nothing to worry about.  You might just be one of the unlucky ones like me..."
5.0,Tea at its finest,"I have enjoyed pg tips since I lived in Bermuda 12 years ago.  When I found tips in the commissary about 4 years ago I was ecstatic! Unfortunately, they stopped carrying it.  I searched online and found the best deal on tips through amazon.  I am once again in tea heaven.  Thanks Amazon."
5.0,Trident is the best!,"IMO Trident is the best gum. For me the bubblegum flavor is the best (not to sweet) and last the longest. I decided to buy it off amazon cause none of the stores in my area sell this flavor in bulk. I can find other flavors in packs of three at these stores but not the bubblegum flavor. Plus, it is cheaper to buy it in bulk than single packs or packs of three. I will definitely be getting more once my supply runs out!!"
1.0,Guess I did not read the label,Clover honey with lavender flavor injected.  Not what I wanted.  I was disappointed.  This is not lavender honey.
1.0,"Bitter, Acid, Cheap tasting","I bought this, lured in by the price and organic nature of the product.  It is awful.  Very bitter taste, with a acid finish.  From first drop to last, it just isn't good, even with cream and sugar added.  Look for Jeremiah's coffee instead.  Much better."
5.0,What I thought I'd never find again,"Amazon is amazing.  I love using this brown sugar.  I like the fact that it has no calories, but mostly I like it because it pours, is easy to use and stores forever.  I was so grateful to find it on Amazon because my old supply from years ago was running out. I assumed that Twin had stoped making it and I would never see it again; that I would have to deal with clumping, hard brown sugar when, like so many other hard to find things, I decided to check Amazon and there it was!  What a delight to be stocked again for those last minuted needs to pour the flavor of brown sugar on hot cereal, acorn squash and the like.  Please excuse my lack of spelling and accept my praise of Amazon and this product!"
1.0,Bag arrived opened.,"Delighted that the shipment arrived one day early, but disappointed when I opened the box and discovered the bag had arrived already opened. There was Farro all over the bottom of the box.  When I went to the Amazon website, I learned that this item is not eligible for return. There was no link to contact the shipper or the supplier for a replacement.  I am hoping this review will generate a response from someone. I will upgrade the review to five stars when this issue is resolved. I would like a new bag of Farro, please."

5.0,"Great product from Brittany, France","Most greatest French Chefs have been using this ""Fleur de sel finishing salt"" on their creations including on chocolate desserts. Sprinkle it on the dish just before serving. Enjoy!"
5.0,Wonderfully nostalgic,"My Mom and I used to eat this fruitcake together when I was a teenager; no one else in my family liked it.  It doesn't contain fruit peel and has a lot of candied fruit, including huge cherries.  However, it's expensive enough that I'm not sure I will order it again, wonderful as it was to have it once more."
5.0,Great flavor.,"I found this is one of the easiest ways to shop for coffee. The Subsribe and Save program saves you money and you never wake up to an empty can of coffee. Maxwell House Original Ground Coffee, 42.5 oz is priced well and I prefer the original  better than the fancy coffee house brands. Trip to grocery store, $10 , one canister of coffee $16, plus tax and hassle. Have is delivered free without tax for $18. Without the hassle.  Maxwell House still has that GOOD TO THE LAST DROP taste and flavor. I recommend this product when you can find it sold through the Subscribe and Save program."
5.0,Great coffee,Wonderful flavor and provides the best coffee one can have in combination with Colombian seed. I would recommend using one part of Tanzanian pea bury with one part of Colombian coffee seed for a strong and flavored coffee.
5.0,Great Stuff - Using for years!,"I have been using vege-sal since my early 20's when I discovered at the High Falls, NY Food Coop.  That's about 35 years, yikes.  It is very good on all foods - not as salty as table salt but extremely flavourful.  Ask my kids, they have it in their kitchens too.  It is hard to find these days but worth the effort to find it.  Happy Eating."
5.0,"Shipping problem ,but I tried again","It shipped Jan 19 and arrived Feb 1, so it took 12 days to arrive. I had to throw it away.Too bad because the first pizza I bought was really good and i intended to make it a steady purchase.But now I'm not so sure I trust this company again.  I wanted to come back and write a better review.Since I love all these pizzas,I ordered again (and then again) and now  I get my orders with no problems.I do not know what happened with the first order but this one arrived in good time and the pizzas were wonderful. I must say thses pizzas are so good they have spoiled me for eating any other pizzas.Even the ones in my home town.I have tried all the flavors Naan has and I love them all.I will continue to buy them <3"
1.0,under rated,"This product rarely works unless you get the seed packs and immediately plant them...Very expensive, and maybe 50% of the time,you may or may not get anything to grow.  I've had this for 3 years now and rarely had but a few things grow...Much easier to go to the garden shop and buy the plants and put them in your garden.  I've had tons of their kits sent to me, and only half of them seem to work...I'll call customer service, and yes they will send more....but by then, the 3 that worked are growing big and you cannot start the new ones.  Sorry to say, this product is for ""rich people"" who have the time time play.  I'm only wanting to plant foods to eat and survive."
5.0,What I expected,"I got the gels on time, the box was a little dented, but not a big deal. I got them within the time I was told. Happy customer."
5.0,They are good,"My girlfriend recently purched them from a grocery store, and wow are they good. I was scared at first, frightened really, most healthy food I have tried in the past has been complete garbage, always tasting like plastic, or you know some orphans died because of what you just ate. But no sir, not these chips. I think these chips may possibly deserve an award, Nothing flashy like the Nobel peace prize but maybe a regional bowling participation ribbon. In this context a personal teleporter would be the nobel prize and the top food product, some sort of cheese and cow monstrosity that has no calories would be the congressional medal of honor. These definitely have their place and they will not budge. Fortunately I have an amazing  girlfriend who provides me with these astounding discoveries of healthy food."
1.0,Pretty But doesn't have a taste,"Got these for my son's bday party, They are very pretty to look at, but I was disappointed that it has no real great taste..."
5.0,Tastes like Grandmothers Swedish Meatballs,Growing up New Years Day was at Grandmothers. The whole family was there and Grandmother did all the cooking. The main attraction was an extremely large pan of Swedish Meatballs (homemade of course..not mixes) and a large bowl of mashed potatoes. This mix is as close to her meatballs as you can get. Just add some creamy beef gravy and you have it all. It's excellent!!
5.0,Awesome Coffee,"While I am not a huge Coffee Connoisseur, I do greatly enjoy a GOOD cup of coffee.  The Keurig Coffee brewer, with this mix of coffee styles, gives some of the BEST cups of coffee I have ever had.  Especially considering the money saved by not getting the same cup from Star""bucks"".  I would definitely recommend this combo pack to any one that is not obsessed with coffee, but would really enjoy a great cup of coffee."
1.0,You better believe it!,"There is a disclamer on this product, stating that excess consumption may cause gastric distress. They are wrong........ a SMALL serving caused me to have gas, a regular serving (1/4th of a bag) caused me 4 hrs of diarrhea."
5.0,Great for when I can't make food for baby,"I saw these pouches at the store a few weeks before our baby was 6 months old, was intrigued by the concept, and picked up a few to try when the time came to introduce solids.  I make about half of our now-7 month old's food at home but as a busy working mom I sometimes run out of frozen cubes and don't have time to make more before she wants to eat, so we keep a small stock of commercial baby food on hand.  Organic food for our children is important to us, and we choose not to purchase Gerber products.  We like the Earth's Best brand of jarred food but it is heavy, inconvenient, and potentially dangerous to haul glass jars around in a diaper bag for meals on the go.  Plum Organics is just now starting to be carried in local stores and we're glad we tried the brand.  I've sampled from the pouches of Pears,  Plum Organics Just Fruit, Apples, 3.17-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) , and  Plum Organics Just Fruit, Mangos, 3.17-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)  and found all three fruits to have excellent fresh flavor.  Right now she eats about a half of a pouch mixed with some baby oatmeal.  It's easy to squeeze the desired portion and then just close the pouch and put it in the fridge until the next day; there is no need to try to spoon food out into a bowl as with jarred baby food.  We are going on vacation when she'll be 10 months old and plan to bring plenty of Plum Organics pouches to feed her while we're gone, since we won't have the ability to bring homemade food."
5.0,Love it,"Gives you the taste and texture of fresh pasta.  Also, like the fact it cooks quick and doesn't keeps its texture when reheated in the microwave the next day."
1.0,No indication how much you are buying,"I am ordering black channa dal, but I see no indication on this product description of how much I would get for the price - no ounces, no indication how big the package is."
1.0,Nasty Pumpkin in a Can,"I love making pumpkin pie, pumpkin bread, and pumpkin pudding during the autumn months.  I never tried Polar Pumpkin until last week.  I'll never try it again.  I chose Polar because it's cheaper than Libby's, but I got what I paid for.  I noticed a strange chemical smell coming from the pumpkin as soon as I opened the can.  I tasted just a little and gagged.  Knowing what canned pumpkin should taste like, I threw out the cans of Polar Pumpkin.  Nasty!  I'll stick with Libby's - learned my lesson."
1.0,Quality Control Issues,"I bought Bentley's Oriental Treasure White Tea a couple of years ago and was amazed at the delicious flavor and subtle aroma.  I coveted my tin and only used a bag on occasion to make it last.  Then I found Bentley's tea here on Amazon.  I enthusiastically ordered two tins!  I wish I hadn't.  This is NOT the same tea I had previously.  I have to agree with the reviewer who noticed a terrible change in the tea's quality along with a change in the label color.  This second batch of tea smelled like weeds, not tea.  The flavor is so aweful that it even ruins other teas if you blend them together.  Shame on you Bentley's for allowing such a load of crap to leave your company disguised as tea in your pretty little tins.  I won't buy Bentley's tea again."
5.0,Mum Mums are great for young eaters,"Great snack for young eaters.  These are tasty, and interesting, for my almost one year old, she loves to ""bite"" foods and is avoiding baby foods, but still loves MumMums.  Started giving them at about 4 months old, and never had any issues with choking.  A really great snack, that does NOT make a big mess."
5.0,INSOMNIA NO MORE...LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"OMG, since entering my 40's I have had issues sleeping! I've been on every prescription pill out there and although they work, I didn't want to be tied to the expense associated with them even after the insurance paid its portion. I am a tea drinker and I experiment with different teas tastes all of the time. I'd heard Dr. Oz mention Valerian Root before and how it helps with Insomnia. I saw this tea at my local grocery store and decided to give it a try, NOT EXPECTING anything major. WOWWWWWW, I brewed one cup and about an hour later I was really relaxed and able to fall right asleep. I have told all of my friends about it. I also tried melatonin and it gave me an awful headache each time I tried it. I love this tea and hope they never stop making it! I even like the taste! I look forward to my soothing cup each night at bedtime!"
5.0,"Pretty, Old Fashioned Candy",Bye with confidence.  This is beautiful old time candy.  You will like it.  Just break it into smaller pieces and put in serving dish.
5.0,Tasty Wheat Pasta,"As far as wheat pastas go this is the best, not rubbery or tough. Just be sure to cook it the recommended time."
1.0,Horrible Quality Control,"Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands.  In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever."
5.0,Great product,A tasty organic and gluten free product at a solid price comparable with mainstream products. It's got a good amount of fiber too. Recommended
5.0,A must have,These are a MUST HAVE! My dog LOVES these and she would live on them if I let her. They are all natural nothing in them except real apple and real chicken. Try the banana ones too!! You & your dog won't be sorry.
1.0,"Terrible product! Expensive, tricked, distasteful and embarrassing","I have never written a bad review in my life, but I felt this was way beyond what i could take. I had recently moved for work and my husband wanted to send me a surprise birthday gift that I could share with my co-workers. So, he spent over $50 and ordered mini cup cakes from this site and gave them the exact address and department that it needs to be sent to. However, the package did not have department address, just the main address, so it traveled all around the company and landed on my boss's desk! She informed me and when I went to pick it up, I told her that it was cupcakes and she invited all my co-workers to share my birthday. Can you imagine the shock, when I opened the box and had to pass out 30 boxes of candy to my new co-workers instead of cup cakes? They tried to be a good sport and tasted it .... it was terrible ... it had all melted and stuck together in the heat like one big discolored, shapeless flat blob! I felt sick and was throwing up after it and so did couple of my co-workers. I was so embarrassed, I had made a fool of myself, made myself and new co-workers sick, wasted everyone's precious time and my husband spent over $50 for this!!! I spent my birthday evening alone, crying and throwing up. I feel so embarrassed interacting with any of my co-workers who had to suffer from this experience. I am very disappointed with the product and service."
5.0,Yummy x 2,"remember those great ""other"" chocolate chip cookies from your pre-celiac days? These cookies are just as good and as easy to make as that ""other"" kind....cookies were gone within 24 hours and people were begging for more!"
5.0,"Love, love, love it!","My husband and I been using his Teriyaki marinade for years now and when I seen this on sale at Amazon I had to purchase to compare.  Just like expected, it's delicious for half the cost.  We use it for BBQ, stir fry and much much more. I'm drooling just writing about it! Highly recommend...Enjoy!"
5.0,BEST COFFEE EVER,"BEEN TRYING EVERY COFFEE BRAND AND FLAVOR FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND THIS IS IT.  I JUST LOVE THIS COFFEE.  YOU SHOULD TRY A SMALL BOX AND SEE IF YOU AGREE.  EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT TASTE FOR COFFEE SO YOU MAY NOT LIKE IT, BUT WORTH A TRY.  I ALWAYS SAY IF YOU DON'T BUY A LOTTO TICKET YOU WILL NEVER WIN."
1.0,Bitter lately,"Not sure what happened but this tastes extremely bitter.  It used to be my favorite.  I will switch to another, more fresh brand next time."
1.0,bummed....,"I was REALLY dissapointed in this product, and the fact that I had ordered so many boxes.  I like the Diet Green Tea, and was hoping I could exchange that...but I kind of doubt it.  I still have a bunch of boxes, and I don't know what I will do with them..."
5.0,My favorite base coffee for blending,"There are many wonderful and complex flavors that good coffees can offer. This is my mainstay since it has great smooth and rich coffee flavor. It isn't acidy or bitter at all. Actually I like a little acidity so my favorite is to blend this with the Smoked Coffee offered on Coffee Bean Direct's website. Dark Sumatra makes the best base coffee for any blend that I've tried. Costa Rican Tarrazu won't stand on its own but will add just the right amount of acidity to make it my second best choice to blend with Dark Sumatra. If you want to discover the flavorful world of rich coffees, Dark Sumatra is the starting point, then start playing with it."
5.0,Fresh and Tasty,"When I opened the packaging I was surprise to find one of the best tasting cookie I have had in a while. Not only did it taste great, the texture was perfect and it was fresh."
5.0,"Great Assortment, got to try out a ton of flavors","I got to try a whole bunch of flavors which was really cool. Yes, the packaging is a little lame, if you're giving this as a gift just wrap it in gift wrap. My K-cups all came in good shape which is really all I cared about.  The poster is there people....it's rolled up in the tube :)"
1.0,Older product,"I've ordered the peanut butter and chocolate chip bars twice so far and it seems that the company is selling older product through amazon.  It tastes a little off, is dry,  and even the chocolate chips are starting to turn white which is common with age.  This is a big contrast when purchasing them at wholefoods. They are usually moist, the taste is great, and the chocolate is dark.  I won't be ordering online again. I recommend buying it off of the shelf to ensure freshness."
1.0,Eww!!!,"Okay. I have eaten other progresso soups that I have been extremely underwhelmed with in the past but this has to be the worst (and it was all I brought for lunch)! It looks nothing like it does on the front of the can. The actual soup is dark green and looks like it's been pulled directly from a swamp. There are limp little hunks of spinach floating around in it and some weird, see-through pieces of celery. I have never eaten lentils before and I found the taste and consistency of the actual lentils wasn't that bad but they were ruined by the green bog water they were hiding in. Even if you can get over the sight and smell of this soup, the taste leaves much to be desired. You have been warned. Time to go raid the vending machine so I can get this taste out of my mouth."
1.0,Delicious but made in China!?,"I just tasted these chips in peach flavour. It's delicious! However, I was astonished to see that this product was made in China. Organic food from China is an oxymoron. Why not make it in the US? I will not buy Organic food from China. I don't trust their QA on food safety and quality. Even the people from China are trying to get healthy and organic food from outside China. If they don't trust the Chinese food producers and government, why should we? NO ORGANIC FOOD FROM CHINA!"
1.0,Unsatisfactory,I was not at all satisfied with the quality of the walnuts. The taste and particularly the texture were poor. I expected a better quality and was very disappointed with the product.
5.0,Cinnamon Heaven,"Really great taste and simple ingredients. It reminds me of stuff my grandma would make, and since the cooking genes got lost somewhere along the way, Grama's is a blessing. :) We are definitely going to be repeat customers!"
5.0,perfect for sweet tooth just coming off gluten,i just started the paleo diet and i love it! lost 4 lbs in like a week! anyway i was so glad to find out there are paleo cookies out there and thank goddess they're good!! i loved the original and when they sent me them i got a sample of tropical and i loved that too! so i ordered the tropical and got a sample of rainforest! at first they're good but if you read the ingredients u'll see there is cayenne pepper in it and im really sensitive to hot spices and i could SOOO feel it on my tong! it was like an after taste. but if u enjoy a little fire with ur sweet u'll like rainforest flavor! really wanna try the alpine flavored ones they're a lot darker in color so it should be interesting :) good job caveman bakery! I LOVE YOU!
1.0,Yucky,"If this is supposed to be Indian food, then I don't like Indian cuisine.  The curry vegetable tasted like canned vegetable soup with curry in it.  The spinach and cottage cheese looked so bad that my husband wouldn't even taste it.  It was like baby food spinach with chunks of tofu in it.  I ate it with lots of rice.  I don't even want to open the others.  No thanks to these."
1.0,Pricing is out of line - 2X the price of buying them from Nespresso.,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like."
5.0,The best tasting hot cocoa I have had!,I am very pleased with this selection.  I have not tried the other hot cocoa brands for Keurig but this one is awesome!  I bought the milk chocolate.
1.0,Waste of time,"I bought this Item 3 Days ago , and i just checked it after I ve seen countless Yellow jackets and wasps and bees go by it without giving it the time of day .It was empty Not one creature in there at all .. so what basically is it suppose to trap?? my Imagination???? Dont bother"
5.0,Wake up with a smile,This oh so yummy 2 calorie a k-cup coffee is light and delicious. Pair together with the Torani Sugar-Free Vanilla Sweetener and you can feel good about your morning cup (or in my case - several cups) of coffee. Yummy yummy yummy! Another Cup Please!
5.0,"Very good tea, very good price!","After cleaning out the grocery store of this tea multiple times, we though it was time to get serious and buy it in bulk. Tea was fresh, came fast, good price, free shipping."
5.0,amazing candy! amazing service!,"I'm thrilled with Sweet Mona's. My sea salt caramels were shipped to me packed with material to keep them from melting - it worked. And my wife raved about the chocolates. She commented every time she ate one, and kept them hidden from me until they were gone! It was the perfect Mother's Day gift."
5.0,Good Product for people with Celiac Disease,"Product tastes very similiar to Kix, but is gluten free.  My daughter is very happy with this product as a choice since her Celiac disease diagnosis."
1.0,didn't recieve 6 boxes,"HI, frustrated with amazon and arrowhead mills. Have only recieved 1 box. becareful. I am working on getting an exchange, amazon won't refund my return. Arrowhead mills is not interested in helping because they are not the orginal supplier. Two years ago I received moldy bread from amazon and Ener-G took care of me. What a difference! My last order from amason of arrowhead mils products was wrong, too. They sent me whole wheat cookie mix instead of gluten free! Hmmm, someone is dropping the ball for arrowhead mills."
1.0,Terrible,"I really wanted to like this. I was hoping to find some good, organic ESE espresso pods. I am using a Handpresso Wild to make the coffee, so perhaps that's a factor. Other pod brands, however, have come out tasting fine. I've tried around 20 brands of pods, and this, unfortunately, is the worst of the bunch. Pretty foul.  The instructions even say to briefly wet the pod before use. I tried that - it didn't help."
5.0,.33 cents each is a GREAT price!,"Great price, awesome Dr. Pepper taste. Can't be beat!! Any way you slice it .33 cents a can is a great price!"
1.0,Crunchy n NASTY,"These are the nastiest dried fruits I've ever tasted.  The picture on the bag shows pieces of fruit, not the nasty flakes inside the bag.  The papaya doesn't taste anything like papaya.  Everyone in the house found it nasty tasting.  Yuck, $31.00 down the drain.  Gave it one star, because it was the lowest I could give."
1.0,sickly sweet,"I'm used to the Tazo Chai concentrate. Tried this because the grocery store ran out of the Tazo mix. First of all, this stuff is way too sweet (even when using 1/4 mix with 3/4 milk). The spices are barely there (with 1/2 mix 1/2 milk). The tea did leave my mouth dry. Will not purchase again, wondering if I should dump the rest down the sink. I'm going back to Tazo."
1.0,Yuck,"Like other reviewers have stated, the quality varies.  The first three boxes I received were great: smooth, creamy, delicious coconut milk.  The one I received most recently is thin, watery, tastes horrible, and has a layer of coconut oil on top.  If this company does not care about quality control, I will not be ordering anymore.  I'm going to start making my own coconut milk."
5.0,It works!,"I bought this tea about a month and a half ago when my breast milk supply dropped, and it's worked great! However, it tastes horrible.  My recommendation for taste? Buy a tea ball (it cuts down on extra powder escaping from the bag) and brew it with some other tea. I've been brewing mine with a bag of peppermint tea as well as MM tea, and I sweeten it with honey. It makes it drinkable, at least."
1.0,Something wrong with this mix,"Delighted to have found a GF brownie mix - only it got us sick as you get with a typical gluten allergic reaction.  Ate a brownie at 10 am, was sick at 11, bloated, gut pain.  Didn't realize it was the brownies - ate another and the same thing until i had a full blown colitis attack on top of the pain.  My husband who is NOT allergic to gluten had the same reaction.  There is something seriously wrong with this product."
1.0,Arrived broken,"Hi there. I've ordered the hazelnut 3 pack of torani before-- it was fine. This order, the hazelnut and cinnamon arrived with the hazelnut 3 pack broken open and one of the bottles had leaked all over the place. The 3 pack of cinnamon was fine. The size of the box should have been smaller with more packing material. Its obvious that there was way too much room for these heavy objects to move around and cause damage. It was a real sticky mess. Smaller box, more effective padding would have made a big difference. Thanks Deanna miller."
1.0,"Weird taste, inedible","I threw my dinner away after tasting one bite. The sauce tasted so weird, so off, that I spit it out. Hated it."
5.0,Gluten Free Cones,This item is delicious and I would recommend buying. It is on the expensive side here but if you can't find cheaper they really are good.
5.0,This tastes amazing!,"Phenomenal stuff!  It came in a dark bottle, but the liquid itself is still clear as advertised.  I haven't tasted a better single-root beer."
1.0,Excellent Product / Bad Price,"This is our favorite Crystal Light flavor! While we down gallons of it during the summer, we also drink it year-round as a flavor enhancer for our nasty-tasting tap water. However, the Amazon.com price of $22 (for 4 pkgs) is WAY more (almost twice as much!) than the $2.79 per pkg that I pay in the grocery store. Would love to buy it in bulk on Amazon.com, but it has to be a better buy!"
1.0,Please avoid!!,"Please do your research on pet foods and what is actually good for your cats.  Hills science diet is a horrible food filled with horrible ingredients.  They charge an outrageous price because it's the #1 vet recommended food.  This is a joke and the only reason why it's rated #1 buy vets is because Hills gives money to soon to be vets to help them go through school.  Then they sell the cat food to them cheap so they can jack up the price and make a nice profit off of your marketing foolishness.  Read the back of the labels of Hills brand and you will see that most of the top ingredients are grains or cheap meat by products which are the feathers, bones, unwanted organs from animals, basically all of the stuff we wouldn't eat. try something like orijen or evo."
5.0,Delicious!,"I ordered these based on the reviews. I'm glad I did. My daughter (and I) love them. They are delicious and not overly sweet. I have only tried the Vanilla, but will happily order other flavors."
1.0,Good Tea but inaccurate listing!!,"This box of green tea has the tea bags packaged 4 per wrapper. So unless you plan on brewing a whole pot at a time, do not buy this! Nowhere in the item description does it say anything about being packaged that way and this is a NON-RETURNABLE item!"
5.0,Herring in Mustard Sauce,"This is good herring, and I like the sauce. The sauce is a little vinegary, but I like vinegar. A nice meal when I'm on the run. It is even better if you heat it. As it says these are just herring fillets, not kippers (they're not smoked)."
1.0,"High Risk, don't buy!",One of the vials was broken when we received this product... but you can't return the product or get a refund.  What a rip off.
1.0,Awful.,"I am recently pregnant and have just switched to decaf coffee.  These appealed to me because of the earth-friendly design and mostly positive reviews.  They brewed fine in my Keurig.  Might not be a ""standard"" k-cup, but they work just as well, with less trash.  Great.  But the taste.  oh my god.  The taste is horrendous.  It's bitter, gritty, strong, but not strong in a good way.  The smell is just as bad.  I drink my coffee black, so it's not like I could even mask the taste with cream and sugar.  I know Amazon doesn't accept returns on grocery items, for health reasons, but I requested a refund anyway and it was granted.  These went straight in the trash, where they belong.  I did try the  Donut House Collection Donut House Decaf, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count  and it is delicious!  That will be my go-to decaf for the next few months."
1.0,Is AMAZON SCAMMING safflwer oil endorsement of Dr. Oz?,"This bottle looked exactly like the front label that is on a current bottle of Hollywood safflower oil I have. They do not show you the back label where it states amt. of polyunsaturated fat (only 2 when needed 7+), or any other info. In my opinion, this is deceitful. Are they trying to taking advantage of those looking for the safflower oil that Dr. Oz refers to on his show. I believe it is why they don't show the back label, but just the front. Amazon and all vendors of this and any other food product should show all the information, front and back labels. I am so disappointed in Amazon that I can't say I would purchase from them again. I now have three bottles of safflower oil that will not be used and I am out $20+ because it cannot be returned. ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS PRODUCT GET THE CLA FROM COSTCO made by Trunature. IT IS MADE WITH PURE SAFFLOWER OIL. I HAVE BEEN USING IT AND IT WORKS. It is about $20 for a bottle of 160 or 180 softgels. I just thought I could get something a little cheaper. I wouldn't buy CLA on Amazon. It is more expensive.[...] is the place to go if you have an account. Otherwise, try Truenature.com I hope others weren't suckered like I was. I guess I should have inquired before purchase, if that is possible."
5.0,Outstandingly good,"Tried a lot of different k-cups in search for a bold, expresso type of coffee. This one fits the bill all right. Strong but not bitter. Am able to make a large and medium cup out of one k-cup. Truly worth a few cents more per cup. Would absolutely recommend this to anyone who wants a ""real"""" cup of coffee."
5.0,french roast coffee,This coffee tastes better than the coffee at the restaurant where I work!  I first learned about eight o'clock coffee up north when I was little.  The french roast is very good!  Thanx.
5.0,Best Peanut Butter Value - Bar None,"We go through a lot of Skippy in my house so I signed up for the subscription. The sunscription price, right now, is 9 cents per ounce (its up to 10 cents/oz as I write this). Thats way better than any sale I could find in Walmart, Target, Kroger, or any other store in the area. I will buy with the subscription as long as they can beat the store prices."
1.0,DO NOT BUY! Boxes arrived full of GRAIN WEEVILS!,I was excited to try this pasta (along with a few other products from the same brand). I opened the box and out came about a dozen grain weevils along with the pasta! DISGUSTING! I don't know where these products are being shipped from but the warehouse must have a pretty serious infestation. I don't think I'll be buying dry food online ever again.
1.0,"disappointing, to put it mildly","My friend and I, both of whom buy Kashi products and enjoy them, opened my package for review together -- with anticipation of a treat.  What we got was bars that were overcooked to the point of turning black.  (Was your quality control on vacation, Kashi???)  In what I could force myself to try, there was one tiny chocolate chip almost too tiny to notice -- and he got none.  The bars were dry and unpleasant.  They tasted strongly of pumpkin, NOT banana or chocolate.  There were large chips of peanut leading me to think they should have contained peanut in the title.  When I told my friend that I could barely give this product two stars, he said he wouldn't even give it one.  If this is Kashi's ""new"" approach to food, I think it will cost them customers.  The poor quality control alone will make me wonder whether the products I already use will continue to be up to snuff.  Both of us deplore wasting food, but even the garbage can seemed reluctant to accept these bars!"
5.0,FINALLY the miso soup i have been looking for,"I have been on the quest for an instant miso VEGAN soup. I thought it did not exist. I have made miso soup many times from scratch but I am lazy sometimes and would like it to be quick and pre-made. I have looked high and low on amazon and all the brands included some sort of fish product. Now many packages do not right out say it includes fish, but ingredients such as bonito flakes are indeed fish. Any vegan should go get themselves a source book because some animal ingredients are not so obvious.   Well you can imagine how excited I was when I read the ingredients to find them ok to eat. I ordered right away. I got the package two days ago. I just tried the soup right now. I made it per the directions. I heated up 12oz of water (directions say 8oz) in my large coffee mug in the microwave for 3:30. After it was piping hot I added the first packet which has the miso in it. Stirred it around then added the second packet which has the tofu and seaweed. Give it 20 seconds to all mix together and took a sip.   The taste is absolutely amazing. I was not expecting it to taste so good. I highly highly recommend this soup. Plus the price is fantastic. I have it auto-shiped so I saved the extra 15%. The kicker on top of everything is that the miso is organic. I try to buy at least 70% of all my food organic. This is perfect. Vegan, Organic, Great Price. Please give this soup a try."
1.0,"Horrible, Instant coffee, Hydrogenated oil inside, health hazard!!!","Read the label carefully, it's instant coffee, not the ground coffee as the other brands, no filter inside, and had partially hydrogenated oil in it, I returned it as hydrogenated oil is harmful and the coffee itself is kind of gas station quality."
1.0,Cost Jump?,"Good product, but the price has gone up by $15 in the last month - no longer a good value.  Any reason for the huge increase?"
5.0,Deliciously healthy!,"Found these at a local superstore and they were so delicious! Went back to buy more and, true to form, Wmt no longer stocks them. Hope Amazon gets them back in stock, they are perfect for snacks, car trips with the kids, or a hasty getaway in the morning when leaving the house on time is essential! Loaded with natural ingredients, they can be warmed in the microwave or eaten straight from the pack. Tasty and healthy! Each bar is 1.48 oz (42 grams), 140 calories, only 3.5g total fat(no trans fat, only .5g satur. fat), 6g protein, 5g fiber, 140mg sodium, low in cholesterol and sugar, high in vitamins boasting 20% daily value of 5 B vitamins. 6/12 Update: found at W**m**t 4 $2.18-2.36 each box."
5.0,You will like this!,Awesome candy. Good flavor and ever so slightly fizzy. Makes an entertaining and unique gift. Only wish it weren't so expensive.
5.0,Great Yeast For Me!,"I am a Home Economist and I owned a bakery many years ago.  Recently I decided to start making bread again at home.  I bought some yeast at the grocery store and was not pleased with it, so I went on-line and looked for the saf-instant yeast that we always used in our bakery.  I was so happy to find it and for such a reasonable price.  It works quickly and just as well as I remembered.  I highly recommend it!"
5.0,Metromint water,"This is a totally extravagant and unnecessary purchase, but the water is wonderful, and I suppose there are more harmful products to consume!  The box arrived in TWO days, and even with a case discount at my local Thriftway, was cheaper via Amazon."
5.0,small swirled lollipops,comical that this is considered a 'toy'.  I bought these as a decoration for a circus themed baby shower and they arrived in perfect condition. I used them in vases surrounded by colored crinkle cut paper and used as centerpieces on the buffet table.  Lots of compliments.  I have kept them and plan to use again for future parties.  these will  not be consumed so no idea how they taste...
1.0,Yuck,"Twinkies were once great but once they sold out to the big corporation, the quality went down the drain. It's too artificial tasting to be considered food. There are a ton of chemicals and additives added. You call this cake?"
1.0,flavored liquid thats it.,"well this is a bummer. I was hoping it would be like the hard candy. but its NOT.  its not sour at all, and it tastes bad to me. its just flavored liquid :("
1.0,Be sure to check the size,It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap.
1.0,SURPRISED! YET VERY SATISFIED!!,ERROR MADE ON INITIAL ORDER BUT SELLER VERY CONCERNED ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND MADE QUICK CORRECTIONS.  GOOD PRODUCT AND WILL BUY FROM AGAIN.
1.0,"Good product, badly packaged.",Ronzoni makes good pasta. Unfortunately I recieved 6 slightly crushed boxes of broken up pasta. They're in my garage. The price was great!
1.0,Beware: Made in China,"I was pouring this expensive bag of premium cat litter into the pan, when I noticed the ""MADE IN CHINA"" label on the bottom. All I can say is SCARY!  It is hard telling what kind of chemicals are in that stuff coming from China.  I will not purchase this litter again."
5.0,My dog loves this,"I have been using these mini chunks for several years and Coco, my almost 7 year old Chihuahua has a beautiful coat, less stool and is very active.  Used to use another brand, but was sent a sample of Iams and been a customer ever since."
5.0,Great Buy!,"I was worried after reading some of the reviews saying the exp. date on this coffee was bad, but I ordered anyway because it's such a fantastic deal. When I got mine it says it doesn't expire for another year! I mean make sure when you order it's from Starbucks and I'd say your good. It's such a great buy and comes in a very nice pop open box thing that makes it simple to grab a ready brew in the mornings and pop it open and pour it into my hot water. I own a Keurig so I just make it brew hot water and then I use these, it's so much cheaper than k-cups and the taste is the same great Starbucks taste I get at their stores! The colombia blend is my favorite blend at Starbucks, it offers a nice bold flavor but it's not too strong and the finish is just fantastic, I recommend Baileys Caramel Creamer to add to your cup of coffee of Colombia, you will have to buy the creamer at your local grocery store though since it needs to be refrigerated. I can't say enough about how great of a buy this is, the only thing I would change is making it a Amazon Prime item, I am a Prime member and love the free 2 day shipping, but had to pay shipping on this since it wasn't prime, other than that, this is my new favorite must have here on Amazon!"
5.0,Great Colors,"I had never used this brand of coloring. They are very true colors, and not messy to use."
5.0,She loves it,"Since starting Wellness wet food, not only does my cat love it, but certain problems she has had cleared up - throwing up, and chronic watery eyes have disappeared. One thing - she gets finicky about eating it when it's cold. At room temp she devours it!"
5.0,JAFFA,my son thought it was awesome but i think it was okay .. but i would definitely order again since my son really love it
5.0,What a treat!,I've been buying and loving this rice for years then suddenly I couldn't get it in my area anymore. Finally broke down and ordered the whole case. Can't believe I did without it for so long. I've been making it with chicken forever but I think I'll give pork a try with the next box. Wish I could rate it 10 stars!
5.0,Spicy Goodness,"The best burst of spicy flavor you can get in a sweet candy. I first saw these in Nova Scotia and have been looking for them ever since.  If you love something with a bit of a bite, then this is the perfect item.  The metal box is ideal for travel and storage."
5.0,Love them,I stay away from white flour and these are the only crackers I eat. They are healthy and delicious. My local store is selling them for 2 bucks per box and another more expensive store still sells them for only $2.40 per box.
1.0,Terrible All Around!!!,"i was expecting something like a bunch of bully sticks but these are gone in literally 4 bites! even with my 14 week old aussie! it seems like a bargain but it's seriously not much at all when the dogs devour a stick in like a min.  they smell like they where dipped in motor oil or something awful. it get a bit better when you rinse them but still stinky and i feel reluctant to feed them to my dogs. my cattle dog mix turns his head when i try t give him these! awful treats, don't recommend to anyone!!! (i bought the beef basted)"
1.0,Terrible!,"This is instant coffee.  It tastes terrible.  If you don't use it shortly after you get it, the cups get hard and stuck together and doesn't work properly.  I won't buy again!"
5.0,Great Garbanzos,"Upon receiving the product, I started a batch soaking to get them ready to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them up in the pressure cooker (after watching Good Eats episode on garbanzos/chickpeas). I am very happy with the quality of the beans. The cooked up tender and tasty. I used some in a soup, added some to a couple of salads and blended the rest up to make hummus. Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store. The burlap bag is kind of cool and the beans are in a plastic bag inside of that. Out of four cups of measured uncooked beans, I only encountered two beans that did not cook up soft. I will buy these again."
1.0,Barking Mad,When I was a little kid my sister gave me a dollar to eat one our dog's biscuits.  I was brought back to that moment in time today when I ate one of these Doctor Kracker Pumpkin Cheddar Flatbreads. I'm not proud of what I did to receive that dollar when I was a little kid. But you should save your dollars and buy something that tastes good.
1.0,Make your own,"Yuck! Melting cheese is not that hard, just make your own. There are good recipes everywhere. Try 1/2 pound gruyere, grated, 1/2 pound emmenthaler grated, tossed w/2 tbsp of corn starch. Simmer 1 cup wine, slowly add the grated cheese, stirring in a figure 8, adding more when the last batch is incorperated. Add 2 tbsp Kirsch. Not hard!  And yes, I have tried this specific fondue, it does not taste right."
1.0,Oral Hygiene Chews,I bought this for my cat.  She has bad breath and I thought this would help her.  She won't eat them!  Just smells it and walks away. Anyone want a free bag of chews?
1.0,THESE HAVE CHANGED....AND NOT FOR THE BETTER!,"Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :("
5.0,Where can you buy this product,I love Lefty's seasoning for chicken and seafood.  But I can't find it anywhere.  I have gone to all the grocery stores in my area and can;t find it anywhere.  I originally got it from a sample and I can't remember where that was.  Does' anyone know where this product can be purchased/
5.0,awesomes service,very good service recieved it alot earlier than expected I ordered right before christmas kinda late but recieved it in enough time for christmas  thank you great service
1.0,Tastes Awful,I was skeptical for good reason.  How can a mix with 0 calories be any good....well it isn't.  I wasn't expecting the taste to be as good as the real thing but it's absolutely awful. It's un-drinkable. I let 4 other people try it and overtime the same thing.... sip....1 second delay ..then the I really tasted something bad face.  One person even spit it out into the sink.  This stuff is gross.  Its basically green colored splenda water.  Don't waste your money.
5.0,Delicious!  Can't even tell this is sugar free!!,"King's Cupboard Sugar Free Chocolate Chunk Hot Chocolate - where have you been all my life?  Whether you want a sugar free product or not, this mix is delicious.  This product sincerely tastes like melted chocolate pieces in your coffee mug.  You would have to do a triple-take to the container to believe it is sugar free.  I originally was looking for Carnation Sugar Free Hot Chocolate mix, but could not find it with Amazon Prime shipping -- I found King's instead and am so glad I did."
5.0,No Sugar - No Difference,"My favorite chocolate milk powder since i was a kid, this non-sugar version tastes just as good as when it has sugar. Definitely a good way to save your teeth, especially when you can drink a whole gallon of milk and maybe more on a hot day with Nesquik at your side.  i remember buying the bunny shaped bins of this years ago, i wish they still had them(at least they don't here not sure of other areas). The bins(even if they are not bunny shaped) are recycle friendly you can give one or two of them to your kids to put their crayons or ''Treasures'' in, and you can blue bin them which is another plus."
1.0,"Even the dog won't eat this, seriously!","I read all of the good reviews of this popcorn and was hoping that it would be at least halfway decent.  I like food to be more salty than most, but this was far too salty.  There is also almost no cheese taste and it has kind of a bad after taste too.  After eating about 1/8 of a bag I just couldn't eat anymore.  I dumped the rest into the dog's dish because she eats anything, even veggies.  She wolfed down several bites but then refused to eat anymore of it and I had to throw the rest out.  I think I'll leave the remaining bags by the microwave at work and donate the unopened boxes to a food shelf.  Avoid this stuff at all costs!"
5.0,The Blue Drink,"Can you believe that there are people out there who can't tell the difference between Pepsi and Coke?  And if they can, some people can't put the tang/taste to the label?  Strange.  Long story short, I didn't drink too much soda while growing up.  I hit high school, and while many of my middle school friends discovered cigarettes, pot, and possibly armagnac (The Amber Drink), I found Pepsi.  I became addicted to Pepsi.  I drank about three to five cans a day, with a Josta every 2 pm during my Physics class in 1996.  Crystal was a dream come true.  * Pepsi is sweeter than Coke * Even when served at the recommended 40 F, Pepsi becomes flat faster than Coke.  At sea level, Pepsi, in my opinion, is practically non-consumable. * Pepsi contains 39mg of caffeine as opposed to Coke's 45mg * Pepsi rivals Coke with their strange, alternative soda releases, such as Crystal Pepsi, Crystal with Citrus, Josta, Pepsi Blue, and Pepsi Holiday Spice.  None of these lasted, unfortunately (or were limited productions).  Popular flavors of this soda that continue to last are Wild Cherry Pepsi, Pepsi Twist and Pepsi Vanilla. * Pepsi is less expensive than Coke * Where Coke's holiday marketing is comprised mainly of St. Nicholas, Pepsi's is more apropos with their blue color: ice, winterscapes, snowflakes, and cartoony reindeer characters  I always feel, because of Pepsi's modern (and vertical) logo on the can, like I am drinking a container of potential energy.  Like I was holding a 12 oz. consumable battery.  This sleek logo (recently aligned with a 3D-shaded red-white-blue sphere) may be an additional reason for Pepsi being America's second-favorite cola.  It is not as nostalgic as Coca-Cola's cursive logo, which hearkens back to the halcyon days of our older generation (and potential customers)."
5.0,Best Curry Powder in the World.,"My title says it all. I like to start with a basic roux (ghee, flour, and chicken stock to constitute), then add a bunch of this heavenly curry powder, finally I add a couple cans of coconut milk.  Serve over chicken, mushrooms, and rice (or whatever's your pleasure)  The only problem with this is that it tastes so amazingly good, it's extremely difficult to stop eating after you're already full!"
5.0,"Excellent Cookie, Very Addicting","Before becoming a Celiac and switching to a gluten free diet, I used to love Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's. I found these on sale at the Grocery Outlet the other day and decided to give these a try. These were so much better than the Trader Joe's Vanilla Joe Joe's and significantly better than Vanilla Oreo's. Even my gluten eating friends said they were addicting. They are great dipped in hot chocolate, milk or tea but are even better on their own. Will definitely buy again."
1.0,MADE IN CHINA,"The bagged product from Smokehouse proudly states it is made in the USA. I naively assumed all Smokehouse products were the same. NOT! I only noticed this 20 oz tub is from China when I went to reorder it. I am not happy at the company misleading its customers this way! I will keep purchasing the bagged product from the company because they are my dog's favorite treats and moderately priced, but I lost some confidence in them."
5.0,best unsalted low-fat chips,I really enjoy the Guiltless Gourmet unsalted baked tortilla chips.  It is so difficult to find products that are both low-salt and low-fat.  These chips are my favorite crunchy snack.
1.0,Another terrible dog food hits the market,"Just because your dog likes it doesn't mean it is good for you. I love In and Out burger but I know better then to make a regular diet of it.  Meat by products is high on the ingredient list and is a terrible ingredient. If a manufacturer had nothing to hide, they would list the specific animal that makes up the meat content. Plus, the meat is marked ""by-products"", which is throwaway parts unusable for anything else and of the lowest quality in nutrients. Wheat, corn, and soy are also part of the ingredient list and among the worst offenders when it comes to allergies in dogs. They are among the most difficult things for dogs to digest. Please do yourself and your dog a favor by feeding them a higher quality product. Review the ingredient list and doing a little research on ingredients will go a long way towards a longer and healther life for your dog."
1.0,Disappointed,"My review is 'don't bother.'  I put this on my wish list after seeing it on (I think) the 'Cool Tools' website. I wish I would have read Joseph Rukaj's review so I would not have received the 'almost right' size as I prefer the Trader Joe's PB. Regardless, I have sufficient hand strength to hold it securely during use but, I still need to finish mixing the PB with a knife, spoon, spatula, whatever, like before because the peanut butter is merely 'stirred,' not really mixed.  What use is a tool that requires you to finish the job with the tool you bought the first tool to replace? Clever doesn't count for much if it doesn't solve the problem. I'd return it if I could."
5.0,Loved the taste and had great energy!,I tried a sample packet of this and loved it! I mixed it with unsweetened vanilla almond milk and it was very creamy with a slight chai and vanilla flavor. Very drinkable and not spicy. I went to a power yoga class shortly after and had noticably more energy and strength!
1.0,francisco is trying to rip you off,"update 2/18/2012:  I GOT MY MONEY BACK about 1/17/2012. If you truly want ceylon/mexican cinnamon, use this link instead  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAU1F0?ie=UTF8&force-full-site=1  DO NOT ORDER FROM LATIN PRODUCTS!! I received the wrong type of cinnamon poorly packaged. It looked like it was done at someone's house and they used twist ties to seal it in thin plastic bags. I complained twice (first Richard, then Lance) before anything was done. francisco (lowercase on purpose) came to the phone with a nasty disposition. When I did attempt to talk, he kept talking over top of me, being irate because it was not an error, his bait and switch of the product was deliberate. He said ""I don't care about your business, I'm the owner"".  After being threatened with legal action, he emailed me a label to ship it back, ""I'm going to weigh it and if any is missing you won't get a refund"". What reputable business comes to the phone with a combatative demeanor and attitude?  This operation is a team of con men in my opinion. Clearly he told the truth when he said he didn't care about my business and I'm sure he will against the law, put this merchandise back in stock.  There are several addresses floating around for this 'business'.  Save yourself the hassle by ordering from someone else!"
1.0,Shameful!,"I ordered this item and was told it would ship immediately. When it was getting closer to Christmas and still no item and no idea of when it would ship I tried to cancel the item. The shipper said it couldn't locate my item from amazon. SO when i sent them a second email showing my order ""miraculously"" they said it was already shipped and couldn't cancel. So sad. I will never order from them again."
1.0,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!,"I have made many BareFruit purchases and always been happy with them.  The items are crisp yet fresh and tasty.  These pears came in WET, BLACK and smell like rancid raisins.  There is no crisp to them.  They don't even resemble pears nor the photo of the product.  They are inedible.  The two other BareFruit purchases that I made that shipped in the same package are perfect and delivered as expected.  Save yourself the money and do not purchase the pears.  Absolutely GROSS and a waste of money."
5.0,Kitty is ADDICTED,"My cat is so finicky- there are no treats that she enjoys.  I bought Kitty Kaviar a few months ago after the urging of a friend.  Since then, not an hour that i'm home goes by without my cat begging for it- i know that she's begging for it because any time i get near the kitchen, she's under my feet going crazy.  when it's feeding time, she has no interest in her other foods, just wants the kitty kaviar.  it's at the point where she's a maniac if she doesn't get it.  i'm hoping it's good for her, because she gets numerous servings per day..."
5.0,"Less expensive than the big box store, and delivered to my door!","That about says it all.  We give our 3 Maine coons a little wet food in the morning for a treat.  I hated having to drive to the pet food store (much cheaper than the grocery store).  Now that it comes to my front door, I couldn't be happier - and so are the kitties!"
1.0,Disgusting,This stuff does not taste good at all.  I thought that maybe it had gone bad or something but it's not close to expiring.  Definitely the worst tasting creamer I've had yet.
1.0,Quite Possibly The Worst Drink I'ver Ever Had,"I'm still having shivers of revulsions from my two sips of Sanbitter. What a pretty little bottle. Looks can be deceiving! Let me clarify that I like bitter flavors- I love radicchio in my salad, drink goldenseal tea, and love Angostora bitters on a sugar cube for a pick-me-up. Therefore, when I spotted Sanbitter at an Italian grocer I had to try it. I think this is what I sputtered out after the first sip: ""Dear God, that is the worst tasting thing I've ever had"" and ""I never thought I'd taste that cherry fluoride the dental students painted on my teeth again."" Enough said. I foolishly tried another sip to clarify my perceptions. They were confirmed. For those who love this, all the more power to you. I will not be partaking again."
5.0,Excellent product!,"This truffle sea salt is excellent! For me, more flavor is released if the truffle salt is adding during cooking. The dried truffle needs the heat to reach it's full potential. Added to warm EVOO or butter, the flavor can be easily infused throughout a dish."
1.0,"weak, not good for espresso","First of all, on opening the bag, the beans were light brown and dry, no great aromas.  I have tried to like it, but it makes horrible espresso drinks (no crema, tastes like weak cheap coffee).  I will go back to San Francisco dark roast for my daily espresso drinks fix. Even though I paid over $20 for the bag, I cannot drink it."
5.0,Best Garlic Blend Ever!!,"Of all the garlic blends I've tried, this is the best! But I haven't found it in stores for forever, so I'm so glad Amazon has it. I wish they had the giant size. This is way better than McCormick's ""Perfect Pinch"" garlic blend."
1.0,Most disgusting product ever!,When this arrived there were no whole dog treats in the bag. The bag was filled with what looked like coffee grounds except it was moving -with dozens of live maggots! This was the worst Amazon purchase ever. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
1.0,Not So Good,"I am a bar-b-que snack lover.  This product does have a very slight bar-b-que flavor, but not enough that I would consider purchasing again.  The nuts which are quite large and nice and crunchy are good but I was sorely displeased with the flavor.  Still have three unopened containers left if anyone wants them."
5.0,dayyyyyem good,"This is a delightful addition to my low carb eating plan which includes steaks, chicken, shrimp, and hamburger patties. I have a bottle on my nightstand for a quick nip during the night.....joke. I love it, thanks. Jim/Anaheim"
5.0,Amazon is the only place I can buy this product,"Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate chocolate chip brownie Mix (120) ounces (6 regular boxes of brownie mix). My grandchildren love the brownies...I can't make enough.  I'll be sad when I can no longer find the triple brownie mix because Girardelli has discontnued this product for some reason.  Ghirardelli Triple Chocolate Chip Brownie Mix, 120-Ounce"
5.0,Great Marinade,"I tried this special sauce on grilled salmon and grilled chicken. It is simply awesome, though not cheap, and I can't find anything better.  Yummy.  RH St. Louis, MO"
1.0,changed the recipe,"I ordered this for my daughter to take for lunch, as this was her favorite...however, Campbell's has changed the pasta to ditalini (not as pictured)and something else seems different, too.  Donated the case to the food pantry."
1.0,NO WAY!!!!,"I promise that this oil smells like bacon. I just received my order today and opened it to use, I put a small drop in my palm and began to rub them together to apply it to my face and NO WAY....NO HOW....it smelled like bacon. I buy coconut oil all the time and it NEVER smells like this! I am soooo very disappointed in the quality of this product....I WANT A REFUND!!!!"
1.0,Itchy and irritating - strong allergic reaction,"I have used the regular Degree anti-perspirant without any problems. I bought the new Degree Silver Ion and after the first I experienced the same as the previous reviewers. It left ft my arm pits itching severally for several days, very irritating. It caused a lot of redness also... Do not take a chance on this one"
5.0,"Fresh, yummy","Packaged nicely.  Arrived at my California home fresh.  Tasty, just as I remember when I lived in Maryland and could buy them at the supermarket."
5.0,Handy Xylichew packets,"Xylichew is the only gum I use. It tastes better than any other gum I've ever had. And then, there is the added benefit of xylitol which is good for teeth.  And these packets are perfect for carrying Xylichew with you on the go!"
5.0,My cats rate this flavor 5 stars,"My two house cats, Sami & Airy, and our feral cat, Grey, all seem to enjoy the Seafood Feast flavor.  As those of you who have cats well know, what they enjoy one day, they may walk away from another day.  Today's review by them gives Fancy Feast Seafood Feast five (5) stars."
5.0,Great Coffee,This product is a winner for its consistent product quality.  Amazon is a winner for developing a distribution system that consistently delights the customer with performance that beats advertising.
1.0,WORST QUALITY OF  BRAZILIAN NUTS EVER..,"I usually buy Brazilian Nuts from amazon.com,this time my wife decided to give me this 5 pounds for my birthday. The shipping and delivery time was wonderful, but he quality of these nuts are the worst ones that I ever got, some those nuts are stale and 99% of bags are composed with nuts cut in half. I don't recommend this product to anybody."
5.0,Some of the Best Pizza Dough Ever!,"I like making pizza at home for several reasons, one of the main reasons being i think its better for you than some of the greasy slices you can buy and for another homemade pizza tends to taste better as well... I've always had a difficult time finding a good pizza dough recipe though, and lets face it, if the dough tastes gross, its kinda downhill from there :P at least for me it is. A friend of mine recommended this dough, she can't eat things with gluten in it. I asked her if the taste of the dough was affected by it being gluten free? she assured me it was amazing and I would not taste a difference. She was right, not only is this dough gluten free, it tastes AMAZING!! It was easy to make as well, just needed water, eggs and oil. The directions were easy to understand and follow also. Each 16oz bag i found out makes at least 6-7 nice sized pizzas (its more of a medium size) To roll it out all i did was keep my hand wet and smooth out the door, it was fast and actually fun to do! My husband loves it and I do as well, it cooks up great without any issues, and you can make a good couple pizzas- definitely great value and a good price. We went to the actual site and it was MUCH more expensive than amazon. the dough is alittle sticky, hence why you want to keep your hand wet when shaping the dough out for the pizza, you cook it about 6-7 mins before you put the ingredients on... HOWEVER if you do forget to cook it first alittle beforehand it really doesnt affect it much, my friend and I have both done this by accident a couple times but it still turned out good :P Its alot of pizza for your buck, How many pizza joints do you know that for 12 bucks you can get around 28 pizzas from? We will be buying more of this soon, Its great if you are doing a kids party and need alot of pizzas, like i said one bag usually makes for us 6 med sized pizzas. Overall i gotta give this product 5 stars!!"
5.0,Excellent dog food.,"We've been feeding Avoderm for about 8 months and our Aussie is doing beautifully.  Lots of energy, shiny coat.  The formula is absolutely as good as Blue, and some of the other more expensive brands.  I would highly recommend it.  Fast delivery, too!"
5.0,Vicki,"This is the BEST low calorie popcorn I have ever had.  It's definitely worth trying.  You'll love it.  It almost has that ""movie theater"" popcorn taste.  Yum!"
1.0,Tasteless coffee,"I think I must have gotten 3 shipments thus far. I canceled it today. Coffee is tasteless, intensity is not consistent and moreover 25% of the pods are duds. They produce nothing but light watery coffee. Instead I would recommend coffee pods by Senseo."
1.0,"FYI this mix ""may contain traces of soy.""","I was very excited to see this product on amazon, and it was prime eligible! Many of my family members have a severe gluten allergy and I was excited that this Christmas we could sit down and celebrate with cookies/cakes/pies/etc. However, when the boxes arrived I saw on the bottom, in bold, ""may contain traces of soy."" This was not mentioned anywhere on the product description or nutrition facts. Many of my family members also have a sever soy allergy, and this ""may"" prevented us from being able to use the mix and therefore I have 6 unopened boxes that Amazon will not let me return.  If the Gluten-Free Pantry bills itself as caring about food allergies, perhaps they should make sure they list every single ingredient on their product page so we can make a clear, educated choice when buying."
5.0,Chai - Green Tea,I love this tea - it is my favorite. I drink it at least twice a day. It has just the right amount of flavor and I have no need for sugar with it.
1.0,Really bad!,"I was making peppermint bark for the holidays and I ran out of the white chocolate melts I had been using. I'd already made one tray using another brand of white chocolate, but I still needed to make another tray so I ran to the store and all they had in stock were these Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. I figured for the price they'd be alright to use, and it is Ghirardelli, they talk themselves up a lot and sell themselves as a fine chocolatier so I figured these would be at least decent.  I was so so wrong.  These were disgusting, first of all. They have a very plain, flat taste. Also, there's a gross after taste that accompanies these. Compared to the other white chocolate I was using, these may as well be classified as inedible. Regardless, I went ahead and attempted to use them. They melt terribly. Actually, they don't melt at all! They became a big, nasty dry mess of powdery white chocolate imitation. No, my chocolate didn't seize, these really are just that bad.  I wasn't expecting these to be great, but I was expecting they would be at least usable. They were not. After trying and failing to use one bag, I have decided I'm just going to use the one tray of peppermint bark I already have made and just make some cookies or something instead. These were a massive disappointment."
5.0,The best cookies,"These shortbread cookies are the best cookies you'll ever eat!  Four different cookies, with 12 containers in each tin ( 3 packets  each of all the 4 cookies) .  A great gift for anyone who loves cookies, especially shortbread."
1.0,"Terrible Ingredient, Again--Don't Buy!","I wrote a review just yesterday regarding Diamond's so-called Natural ""Lite"" Lamb and Rice Dog Food.  I was shocked to read that ""powdered cellulose"" was one of the top ingredients.  Well, guess what?  ""Powdered cellulose"" is in this ""natural"" cat product, as well.  Why would any caring cat owner feed his or her beloved pet powdered cellulose?  I guess Diamond has to use some kind of filler, in order to reduce the amount of ""real"" food.  Powdered cellulose is certainly cheaper than chicken; and, after all, it's all about the money.  Moreover, the 18 lb. bag arrived in a cardboard box that looked as if it had been dropped from an aircraft, AND the bag itself was split!  Approximately a pound of food was loose and leaking from the box.  Shame on Diamond for its awful ingredient and on Amazon for its crummy packaging and shipping.  I'm stuck with a split bag of awful food and the bill for it, as well.  Don't make the same mistake as I did."
5.0,"Love this tea, great over ice or hot","This is great tea, really good over ice or hot, the stevia gives it a nice sweet flavor with NO CALORIES!!"
1.0,Has MSG.,"Did not use.  Description said no MSG.  Read label when received, contains MSG, all four. Not worth getting a migraine, will give to someone who is not bothered by the MSG."
5.0,Review on TASTE,"I'm writing this review, because it's exactly the kind of review I was looking for before I bought this product, but could not find anywhere.  When I first started using Natural Calm I bought it in the Raspberry-Lemon flavor, thinking it sounded the best and used it with water (usually just put it inside a water bottle and shook it up to mix it and drank it that way). Both me and my husband used it and HE really liked the taste, but for me this stuff tasted BAD. I don't know why, but I did not like the taste at all. I guess some people do (obviously my husband did or at least didn't mind it) but I definitely did not. It made drinking it everyday a CHORE.  So, this next time I decided to try the one that isn't flavored and I like it SO MUCH better, like a million times better. I just mix it in with my blueberry-pomegranate juice and it's great! It is virtually tasteless and just adds a little 'fizz' to the juice that I actually LIKE. I also put it in teas as well.  I wanted to write this review just to let people know that not everyone loves the raspberry-leomon flavor (and I didn't think I'd like the orange to begin with, but haven't tried it yet and probably never will). There are a lot of reviews claiming it tastes great... but for me not so much. I recommend the flavor-less one.  Also, be careful when starting out to use the recommendation on the bottle and start with 1/2 a teaspoon a day and then work up from there. :-) I never had any negative side effects, but I guess some people get diarrhia if they take too much in the beginning.  This stuff really is amazing and will help you feel GREAT! :-) If you're thinking about trying it don't hesitate. It has many, many benefits. You might just be using it to help with mood or to help with ADHD/concentration, or just for a natural way to keep from becoming constipated... There are MANY benefits. But no matter what you're using it for, it's bound to help out your body and mood in other ways as well! :-) Can't say enough good things about this product! Just try to get the flavor-less one first, it's so much better!! I hated having to drink it when we had the raspberry-lemon one. But now I definitely don't, and like the little fizz it gives my blueberry-pomegranate juice & teas! :-) Drinking it right now and loving it! And loving the way it makes me feel and the concentration it gives me!"
5.0,My Akita loves these beefy sticks!,"My 7 month old Akita loves these special treats!  And, they are just that..treats.  Not bully sticks or rawhide bones.  And, they are healthy for her which I like.  5/4/2012 Update, I am still buying these beef sticks for my now 90 lb Akita.  She loves these special treats and they help keep her teeth clean.  When the package arrives from Amazon she can smell them through the box and can hardly wait for me to open the box.  We even share them with the neighbor's dog and he loves them too!  These beef sticks are safe as they are easily chewable and I don't fear her choking on large gummy pieces like rawhide bones.  We highly recommend!"
5.0,"Great taste, great value. Try it!","I've just begun drinking coconut water, and this is my favorite so far both in value and in taste. It is the sweetest I've found that doesn't contain any added sugar (like some brands of ""coconut juice""). If you've tried Zico and have been disgusted by its lack of flavor, give this one a try. It's cheaper, and muuuuuch tastier. And it's good for you! Only 76 calories in a can: much healthier than a can of soda.  As to the packaging, mine arrived with perhaps 5 cans slightly dented and all others perfectly intact. I can't complain about that, considering that it's an imported product. And mine arrived nicely chilled, so I could enjoy a can right away! That may be the product of the colder weather, but it was a nice surprise.  The one thing to note is that this brand comes without coconut pulp. I rather enjoy having bits of coconut to chew on, but it isn't a deal breaker for me.  I used the subscribe-and-save option just to get the better price the first time around, but this product won me over. I plan on keeping my subscription."
1.0,My beautician asked me why my hair was shedding so much! I ended up with a bald spot!,"My review below is very detailed, but if you are having issues with your hair because of this shampoo your FIRST step is to get it out of your hair.  Wash your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, follow with a moisturizing conditioner, and then use Apple Cider Vinegar or another vinegar to strip this shampoo and reminents out of your hair.  THEN do a hot oil treatment.  After the hot oil treatment wash and condition again and your hair should stop shedding. =============================  My review:  I don't know if this shampoo is damaging my hair, but I noticed that I can just touch my hair after using this shampoo and it sheds. My hair sheds a lot anyway so I definitely would not use a shampoo that causes it to shed even more. The shampoo smells good and is creamy.  From reading the other reviews, apparently YOU HAVE TO USE the conditioner or you will mess up your hair.  I would NEVER use a shampoo that strips the hair just so you can use a special conditioner to re-soften it.  UPdate: I am downgrading to a ONE (1*).  I have NEVER had a bald spot in my life.  It has been 3 weeks now and my hair feels like straw (in spite of several deep conditionings at home and the salon).  Today, I look in the mirror and I now have a bald spot (IN THE FRONT OF MY HEAD) from all the breakage and shedding.  It is CLEAR this shampoo has a protein in it which is a NO-NO for damaged hair UNLESS you use a certain type of conditioner to bring back the softness.  Once I discovered the bald spot, I began to panic and I went and bought the CLEAR conditioner trying to get the dryness to leave and it still didn't leave.  I am sitting here now with my regular conditioner trying to get the softness back.  I am afraid it will not come back and I will have to wait for my hair to grow out.  This shampoo is HORRIBLE.  Update #2: This is all I had to do to stop my hair from falling out.  I had to do a clarifier.  First, I used a mixture of baking soda and water.  This soften the hair immediately, but the shedding didn't stop so I slept in a plastic cap with an oil [I used mustard oil, but any oil likely will do]).  I woke up this morning and the hair was definitely in better condition.  I then went to my refrigerator and used Apple Cidar Vinegar, more oil, and my Creme of Nature Shampoo and Conditioner.  The hair is FINALLY back to its original condition (except for the bald spot)."
5.0,great coffee cake,Drakes coffee cake is the best. The date was good. It keeps well in the fridge. Recommend this to anyone who drinks coffee.
1.0,Return Policy--No Returns!,Never even heard of 'Tassimo Professional (Foodservice) Coffeemakers'. so was innocent mistake to buy for my home machine. discs do not work at all. like barcode-reader hasn't a clue. Return policy sucks. One more example of price too good to be true.
5.0,Fantastic Beverage,What a refreshing tasting beverage...Unlike anything I have tasted before....The juice and carbonation mix great together...
1.0,My cat doesn'tlike anything about this,"except the sauce! Who knows when you are dealing with a gourmet cat? I keep coming back to it after a few cans of other kinds, but she is on to me... now where to get rid of half a case of cat food?"
5.0,These are great!,"Both my boxer's favorite treat.  It's healthy, they love it, and it smells good enough for me to try!  (I haven't..yet, for the record).  Wellness continues to impress me with their wholesome products."
1.0,Innova Adult Formula change,I've used Innova Dry Adult Food Large bites for years and my four dogs all did well on the food. The company was bought out in the last year or so by a larger company.  They just recently changed the formula to include a bunch of new items and my dogs can no longer eat it.  Two of the four of them immediately developed a lot of gas and then started to itch within days of giving them the new bag of food.  One literally tore her neck to shreds scratching and we now have a vet bill.  I'm sorry to say we will no longer be using this product! Very disappointed in their decision to change the formula so much at one time.  They had a great product the way it was!
1.0,Zero is not an option! [unfortunately],"Dil's Royal Tea is certainly not fit for royalty. Seriously, this stuff is rank...it truly rots! When I placed the order, I was somewhat hesitant, given that it was not yet rated. But, then I thought, ""It's English tea...how bad can it possibly be?"" As it turned out, this was faulty logic, indeed.  After brewing for the prescribed time, the resulting liquid neither smelled nor tasted like tea, or raspberries, for that matter. It had a sickly sweet and decidedly chemical aftertaste. Needless to say, I would never purchase another product from this supplier. ""Caveat Emptor!"""
1.0,vile,Just think of a Margarita that has been sitting overnight on a bar and you will have a pretty good idea of what the Margarita tastes like.Not good.I made a pitcher of the stuff and no one in the house would drink it. The apple flavor is ok.Something different and though I can't say I enjoy it I do intend to use it up. I haven't tried the Mojito yet but I am not very hopeful.
1.0,deceiving,I wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this RIPOFF!!!!  I had to by another gift to go with it so I don't look like a cheapskate!!!
1.0,BEWARE,"We've had several nylabones for our dogs.  They loved chewing on them and the bones seemed to hold up very well--until a piece broke off and lodged in the small intestine of my dachsund.  Since it's plastic, it doesn't show up in x-rays and the blockage wasn't identified until it was too late.  Always supervise your pet when they are chewing anything that can be chewed up!"
1.0,Won't order again,"I have seen bags and bags of the ""flops"" you can get at the factory so I ordered a bag thinking that I would be getting close to the smaething. NO, mostly all one color not the varity I expected. I feel they ship out the ones that won't visually sell at the factory in their gift shop. I was very disappointed as I had to through the bag out because they were inedible. I won't buy again through the mail."
1.0,horrible,This jelly is absolutely impossible to spread.  It takes 4-5 packs just for 1 slice of bread and it is globby because you can't spread it.  I won't be buying this ever again and hopefully you won't either.
1.0,PLANTER'S BLACK WALNUTS,Cannot give this product even 1 star.  Sour tasting....ruined efforts at making Black Walnut-Buttermilk Bread.  A wasted order.
1.0,Artificial taste,"These cups are artifically sweetened with sucralose - I didn't realize until I tried one, and ended up with a little bit of a headache, which made me check the ingredient list - it isn't noted on the front of the box.  They definitely have an artificial taste, I would not buy them again."
1.0,Unhappy with this product,I was very disappointed with the quality of these Juniper Berries. They dry and hard and had no aroma or taste.
5.0,"Forget the Everlasting treats, just put regular treats inside","I originally bought this product to use with the Everlasting treats.  My powerful American Bulldog/pit mix popped the Everlasting treats out and consumed them in no time, so I originally chalked this toy up as a failure.  But then I realized I could put regular treats inside it, and, used in that manner, it excels.  I've gone through several different treat-dispensing toys, trying to find one that both held up to my tough dogs' determined chewing, and also delivered the treats at just the right ""not-too-fast, not-too-slow"" rate.  Most of the toys I've tried deliver the treats too quickly, which defeats the purpose of keeping a 'home alone' dog occupied for hours.  The Buster Cube delivers treats at a nice rate, but the hard plastic construction makes it so incredibly loud that the noise not only makes it less enjoyable for the dog that's using it, but it also agitates my other dogs that have to listen to it.  This toy is very quiet, and VERY durable.  My dog is a powerful, determined chewer (he once ate a hard plastic floor tray designed to set dog bowls on)and he has been using this toy daily for months, and it shows very little wear.  I fill it about 1/3 full with the low calorie Trader Joe's dog treats, and it keeps my boy happy and focused for hours.  So, if your dog is a determined chewer, skip the Everlasting treats and just buy the ball and use it for your own treats.  I guess the only challenge might be finding treats that are just the right size, if you don't have access to the Trader Joe's treats, but I'm sure Petsmart and Petco carry something that will work.  A treat that is about dime-sized works great. Something the size of dog food kibble would fall out too quickly, but it could be used to deliver a meal to a dog that tends to eat too fast.  It might not be apparent from the photo, but the x-shaped treat-dispensing slots are inset from the outer edge of the ball quite a bit, making it very difficult for the dog to chew on that portion of the ball directly, which, along with the material the ball is made of, contributes a lot to its durability.  Here's a link to the treats I use in this ball:   Trader Joe's Charlee Bear Treats   www.amazon.com/Charlee-Bear-Treat-16-Ounce-Liver/dp/B0002XAFTG/ref=sr_1_cc_1"
5.0,My boxer loves it!,"I have a 4 year old boxer who has always had an issue chewing dry dog food. Sometimes she'd vomit up whole food because she couldn't chew properly due to her boxer underbite. I decided to try out this boxer blend on a whim, and wow what a difference it has made! This food is shaped to force boxers to chew. My girl has not had any issues of vomiting since we've switched over a few months ago.  My dog also gobbles it right up! She loves it! She used to pick at her food all day, but with this food once I fill up her dish she eats it right up! My girl seems to have lots of energy and I'm so happy we found this food at such a great price on amazon."
5.0,YUMMY!,"Tart - then sweet - candy that tastes GREAT.  Nice to find this CHERRY flavored treat!  Low on calories, too...can't beat that!"
1.0,Disgusting flavor and after-taste,"How a supposed Swiss company can create and call this ""coffee"" is inconceivable to me.  Gevalia's Cafe Crema is acceptable, but this stuff doesn't even qualify as coffee in my book.  Even with milk this tastes like burnt metal.  I've had better coffee out of an army ration.  Anyone who rates this higher than one star has either never had real coffee, or drinks their coffee while smoking a cigarette.  Disgusting."
5.0,Product is VERY good,"the problem I had was in the shipping. Amazon bundled them up so tightly together that the chocolate inside the packages all melted. If they could ship and pack them better problem solved. As for the product, it is AWESOME! I am just bummed out that you can no longer get these locally (unless you live in Minnesota)."
5.0,Great chocolate fix,They are so soft and great chocolate taste. They are made with whole grains but no one will ever know.
5.0,Love at First Sip,I have never loved tea (without a pile of sugar and cream) until this one. I'm addicted and pace nervously when my tin runs low. Order the 50 pack. You will not regret it.
5.0,Fantastic!,"Pretty sure I just found my new favorite drink. Not only is it affordable, but it's truly tasty. You're going to love it!"
1.0,Not very good,"I was excited to try these, as they get rave reviews.  I've not had a sandwich cookie since I went gluten-free 10 years ago.  Sadly, I was unimpressed.  This surprised me, as other Kinnikinnick products are really good.  Right away I noticed that they do not look like the image on the package--golden and rich.  Instead, they appear pale and not particularly creamy.  Looks did not deceive.  They don't have a vanilla flavor at all.  In fact, there is no flavor, just overwhelming sweetness.  The cookies are OK, though they are very crumbly.  They have the barest hint of vanilla.  The filling has pretty much no flavor, is gritty, and leaves a powdery residue.  They are way too sweet and come off tasting synthetic. I scraped the filling out and just ate the cookies.  Despite my craving for a sandwich cookie, I would never buy these again.  The search goes on."
1.0,Breathies are made in China,"These used to be the only treats my dog would eat.  He loved them, and would not eat anything else.  I saw a news report about the FDA warning on china imported jerky treats, and thought no way could that be reason my dog has been having health problems, they sell them at Whole Foods and advertise the chicken as organic and free-range, words which just aren't used in china imported meat.  I took a close look, and there it is, made in china in TINY print.  I stopped feeding them and slowly my dog has stopped throwing up all the time, has his energy back, and just obviously is feeling like himself again.  Please don't play roulette with your dogs life.  Check all packaging closely, and tell this company to stop importing from china!  Dogswell, btw, will not respond, and has banned and blocked and deleted my inquiries on their facebook page.  They do not care about your or my dogs health."
5.0,Great mix- fun to play with,"I love this mix, and because it is plain it is fun to play with.  So far I've added chocolate chips to it; that was good, and chopped up dried apricots with about 1/4 cup of almond meal plus about one more TBS milk (delicious), and chopped dates and walnuts (wonderful- served them with honey), and a mix of dried berries (blueberries and strawberries)- marvelous.  All these iterations took at the most about 5 minutes to prepare :-)  I find I don't have to bake them quite as long as the package says- but I make small scones- and perhaps my oven is erratic.  At any rate, keep an eye on your first batch to get a good idea for baking time.  I'm looking forward to trying savory additions next.  I'm sure they will be good too.  This mix is fantastic alone, also- but it's so much fun to add things I find it hard to stop.  The mix is excellent quality, and I was very pleased to find the sell by date is a long way off (Nov 17 2011, for my two orders).  I've ordered all the Garvey's mixes, since my family has so enjoyed this one and the coffee cake.  This is a truly exceptional company.  How lovely to have found them.  Edit:  Have now made the fresh blueberry scones (as you see on the side of the package- it was great!  I topped it with some glaze and the blueberry sugar that Amazon sells.  I also made a rosemary ham, shredded cheese and green onion scone (2 slices thing ham, minced, 1 cup shredded Mexican blend cheese, and one finely diced green onion)- these were really really good.  And finely, I created a Parmesan, orange peel and white pepper scone that was the best of the lot.  I grated the peel off two organic blood oranges, added about 1/3 cup shaved parmesan, and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  The taste was absolutely out of this world."
5.0,Dog's love em!,"We switched to these after my vet said my dog had high cholesterol & wanted to put him on medication.  These are little soft chews that my dog loves.  We stuff them in his kong ball and he will chew forever to get it out.  After being on this and diet dog food for a few months, our dog's cholesterol was closer to normal.  My neighbor tried them with her dog and it loved them so much, she asked me to get her some the next time I was at the vet's office, so I came online and ordered a case for us and everyone we know that has a dog.  I am sure they will get eaten very quickly!"
1.0,Terrible... the absolute worst!,"I love pretzels, but these were the absolute foulest things that ever entered my mouth... and trust me, I've eaten in foreign countries where everything is eaten.  I can not express enough how bad these are.  I ate one (or should I say chewed and spit out) and immediately threw out the entire 2.5lb bag."
5.0,Navitas naturals maca powder,It  help me with work out for extra kick  and extra boost for  sex drive a plus and it all natural product.
5.0,get up & GO !!!,"This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)"
1.0,horrible,"i just received the ajvar today, it is so horrible. i cannot believe this is what they sell as ajvar. i am from Macedonia and the ajvar over there is nothink like this one. do not buy this if you think thats ajvar, because is not. the smell is pretty bad, and you will not want to taste that. pretty disappointed, i paied $14 for it to be that bad. i do not recomend it to noone."
1.0,Packaging quality problem,"""Both"" of Gloria Jean's ""Hazelnut"" and ""Vanilla"" packs of 50 contained only ""49.""  Does Gloria Jean's have a fundamental packaging problem ??"
1.0,Cancelled my monthly order after trying it.,"We are a dairy free family who use coconut milk as a substitute, so I am pretty familiar with coconut milk.  I had purchased several cans of Native Forest from a retail store and liked it - I use it in my coffee as a creamer.  However, the stuff that was delivered to me through Amazon was completely different that the cans I bought at the store.  The milk is very thin (which I don't mind) and incredibly oily.  I shook the cans thoroughly before I opened them, but you can see the oily floating at the top.  The milk separates when in the fridge with the coconut oil forming a thick layer on top.  There is an odd flavor to the milk, too.  I am so bummed I have to go through 12 cans of this before I can order some Thai Kitchen."
1.0,Quality control needed ASAP!,"Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side."
1.0,Does Not Compare To Other Nana's Cookies,These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn.
1.0,Pleaes bring back the old formula,"I have purchased Rich, chocolate Ovaltine since my now 15 year old was old enough to drink milk, but wouldn't because of the taste. Doctor said to add chocolate. Since Ovaltine has more vitamins than the others, we started using it. Now I have 4 children all considered under weight and loved that Ovaltine made their milk palatable. My youngest and most underweight refuses to drink milk without it. Bought the new recipe a few weeks ago. Kids opened it up and the smell was horrendous! I thought it went bad. The taste was not the same either (sort of like egg nog that's gone bad). Then I noticed the ""New Improved recipe"". Who's the marketing genius behind this one. Yes I see less calories, sugar and sodium in the new recipe, but if I was worried about that I wouldn't be adding chocolate to my milk in the first place! PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD RECIPE. My underweight children need it!!"
1.0,"I'm not a picky eater, and this is the grossest thing i've ever put in my mouth","I bought these noodles because of all the stellar reviews I read. I am not a picky eater. I eat sugar free, low-carb, low sodium, fake cheese, cardboard-like things all the time and like them. In fact, there is no food that I absolutely don't like or won't eat until now.  When I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was the terrible smell. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but it's kind of like joint compound or drywall spackle, or something that is definitely NOT food. I figured it might be the packaging, so I spent a little extra time rinsing the noodles than the directions called for. Smelling them again, I knew it was the noodles, but stayed hopeful that parboiling and sauce would fix everything. I followed the directions, and since I love asian noodles decided to dress my Miracle Noodles with good ole soy sauce. The noodles tasted just like they smelled, AWFUL. However, being the daughter of someone who grew up very poor with little food, I couldn't waste them, so I took another bite. The taste and smell mixed with the texture of rubber bands started to gross me out and make my throat clench. I took a breath and looked into my bowl. I own two cats and thought there was a cat hair in my pasta, so like any other time, I plucked it out; no problem. I took another bite, and noticed another ""hair."" I picked it up and found that it was attached to a noodle. I poked around the bowl with my fork and discovered these strings everywhere. In fact, you know when you clean your hairbrush and you pull out hair balls with spider-like hair legs? Well, I found a ""miracle"" hairball happily squatting in my bowl. That was my last straw and I had to stop eating. This wasn't the worst food experience of my life, but it ranks up there. Zero gluten and zero calories is just too good to be true. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Seriously?,"Ok, we love HOT sauces, but this is rediculous! We thought that like a good hot sauce, this would go good on tacos, nachos etc with some nice heat, but this stuff is stupid hot! I bought a three pack and regreted it the moment we tried it. This is their standard insanity sauce (not the hotter one's that Dave's sells) and we cannot even tolerate a few dashes on our tacos. I'm good."
5.0,"Available elsewhere for much, much less","First, with 0mg of cholesterol, this is a great alternative to butter.  It really enhances the taste of popcorn without the health worries.  Second, it is grossly over-priced on Amazon. Just go to your local Walmart and get it for less than three dollars for a 16oz bottle."
5.0,"Moist, Tasty, & Just Like The Real Thing",I first had this mix as a cupcake at my baby shower. My sister knew I needed something gluten free and could not locate a bakery that could make a cake...so she decided to make some fun cupcakes for me to eat in addition to the fancy cake she purchased.  THEY WERE SOOOO AWESOME! Thank God I am pregnant and nobody questioned my eating 3 cupcakes! They were SUPER moist and light. The flavor had JUST the right amount of chocolate.  I know I should try making a cake with this mix but I must admit the cupcakes were soooo good that we made a batch for just the 2 of us the other day! And AGAIN they are GREAT!
5.0,Dogs Love Them!,My Maltese and Cavalier King Charles love these treats!  I feel good about feeding them a healthier treat. Not made in China!
5.0,My Cat Loves it!,I have used this product for many months and my cat never got tired of it...he loves the taste and eats it like a treat.
1.0,Great item WRONG DESCRIPTION,I ordered 4 boxes of 8 nutri grain bars and amazon only shipped 2. I contacted customer support and was told that they would credit the order amount as a one time exception. I am livid. Amazon screwed this up and in order for me to SAVE THEM MONEY I do not ask for the item to be reshipped. IT would cost them 8-12 dolllars to ship this ONLY BECAUSE AMAZON SCREWED UP. I told them to cancel the order and not reship and they are doing me a favor?? THIS is a exception with the exception should be DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM YOU WILL BE SHORTED 2 boxes.
1.0,delivery system is horrible,"The plastic connector kept popping off my hose - I was completely soaked in less that 10 minutes. I had to keep crimping the hose and re-connecting, only for it to pop out of place again. When I turned the white dial to the ""on"" position, IT kept popping off as well allowing water to jet out everywhere. water with pesticide. all over me. not fun at all.  cheap plastic parts all the way around that fail. I would never buy this product again"
5.0,Great shipping,"I sent Kellogg's Cerael out to our troop's. The individual box's of Kellogg's cereal with stood the the travel over sea in great shape. Haveing Kellogg's in the morning is just a little way to say thank you for all that you do. The individual box's was the best way to go, that way everyone could have the kind they liked. Thank you Kellogg's"
1.0,TOO MUCH SALT/SODIUM = DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH,"760mg SODIUM/SALT PER ""6"" PIECES  =  DEADLY/DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH ; TOO MUCH ""SALT/SODIUM""  IS  ""KNOWN""  TO  CAUSE  ""ALL KINDS OF  DEGENERATIVE DISEASES""  &  ""PREMATURE AGING""  ;  HOW DO PEOPLE  EAT  THIS  ""DEADLY FOOD""  ????

5.0,Big win with our Pride.,"I have five totally indoor cats, which means that they have zero access to fresh greens.  One of them, aptly named Monster, will eat anything that looks remotely like a plant; green fabric, faux flowers, my floral purse.  Thus far we have tried approximately 5 other brands of cat grass and this one is the biggest hit.  The cats all love this stuff, and we are also snipping bits off for our chinchilla and box turtle. The packaging is nice and sturdy so the cats cant destroy it while munching. Greens are thicker and healthier looking than most of the other brands we've tried. Directions are easy to follow. I like that its USDA certified and provides batch information for each bag, including contents, date tested, and type of wheat. Unlike many other brands of pet greens that only target cats, this is marketed towards a variety of animals and includes suggested methods for feeding each.  I am the inventory mgr at a petstore and this allows us to reach more customers with the product! The company, Bellrock Growers, supports animal rescue, adoption and shelter programs, which is an added bonus to an avid animal lover! The only downside is that I have to hide the container while the grass is regrowing!  The cats will go to great lengths to find and munch on it.  I highly recommend this brand of pet grass!"
1.0,defective pumps,"Do not purchase..........I bought the 3 pack. In about 1 week, 2 of the 3 don't pump anymore. The 3rd has only been used by (a friend)twice."
5.0,loved it,"I have the most picky dog in the world.  She's a big dog, which usually means they'll eat anything, but not my dog, so when I got her the Likety Stik, I honestly didn't think she'd like it, but she loved it!  And what a great training tool.  Rather than fill your pocket with treats,(that usually go through the wash) you have a neat, no fuss way to reward them.  I did have to squeeze it to get the liquid moving along after she'd licked it, and it dripped onto her pure white, newly bathed ruff, but it came off with just water, so no worries.  I then took the Stik over to my in-laws to give to their obese King Charles spaniel, and he of course loved it, because he eats anything.  What they liked was being able to give him treats that didn't add to his weight problem.  Lickety Stik is a great new way of treating your dog.  Whoever came up with it is a genius.  I'm going to buy every flavor for my dog, and one for my in-laws dog."
5.0,Absolute Best Pep Stick For The Money,I've been eating these since the early 80s. They are my favorite brand of all time. It seems they are getting impossible to find even from Oh Boy Oberta. My package arrived today and they are as fresh as the day from the factory...meaning well preserved and soft. I hope I can find more.
1.0,awful,I have no idea how there is anyone who actually likes this stuff - it is AWFUL!!!! I like regular Hawaiian punch so I got these but I wish I hadn't.  It is so bad.
5.0,love them,I love these because they are small. They don't have an odor. They were also cheaper than the brand I used before.
1.0,Did not grow...,"Ok first of all right when I opened the package which came in two days since I used two day shipping, The can was dented all around and literally punctured in some spots. I have the can in the right temperature and follow the directions, It has been exactly two weeks and not even a sprout is showing. I cannot contact seller for some reason because the option is not there, so this smells kind of fishy. I demand a refund or another NON DENTED/WORKING can."
1.0,These are terrible,I was so excited to get these.  I figure they would taste along the lines of the dehydrated strawberries you find in cereal.  I was completely wrong.  When I opened the package it smell terrible and tasted even worse.  It didn't even taste like strawberries.
1.0,It has ASPARTAME in it.,"If you knew the dangers of aspartame you would not be consuming this drink with this artificial sweetener in it.  I would recommend to do some homework on the dangers of artificial sweeteners and you will know what I am saying.  There is plenty of information on the subject.  If you have any kind of health problem,  suffer from any kind of malady and have no clue what is causing it and you consume any beverage or food that has aspartame,  nutrasweet,  splenda, sucralose any artificial sweeteners a like I would recommend stop consuming the foods and drink immediately.  I personally do not like the taste of artificially sweetened foods and drink.  I have a strong sense of taste and can tell immediately if something is sweetened with this crap.  I have inadvertently consumed foods and drink that has artificial sweetener in it without my knowing and I could tell immediately by the horrible after taste it leaves me.  But besides the taste the dangers of this rubbish is what deters me from consuming it along with MSG (monosodium glutamate."
1.0,awful,"My dog loved this bone, but within 1 week he had 3 broken teeth.  This items not worth the hundreds it will cost in vet bills."
5.0,Great flavor and just the right strength.,"I never go to Starbucks for my coffee fix, but was curious about the Clover machine they had at a few select locations.  I tried the Blue Java and was very impressed with the quality and complexity of the coffee.  This and Blue Bottle Coffee are the beans I use for my drip at home.  My fuel!"
1.0,Just Gross,"I did not like this at all, worse than the gas station cappiccino, which I do like. The grove square french vanilla is just nasty really and it leaves a bad after taste. oh and you have to run a hot water cycle after using it to clean the machine, nothing lefted in the k-cup either, well just a little bit of water to leak from the k-cup when throwing away. I will not buy this again at any price. The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?"
5.0,Best Coconut Flour,"I have tried several brands of coconut flour.  This one is clearly the best in flavor, texture, and ease of use.  I love the convenient one-pound packages(I usually buy in groups of six and refrigerate all of them). The packages are not so easy to access on a daily basis, so I open one and pour the entire bag into an airtight container which I store in the refrigerator. Works great!!"
1.0,Taste is awful!,"The product is reasonable in price but it tastes awful. Label states to improve taste mix in with almond milk however, doing so made it taste worse! It is very thick and does not blend well. a good amount of protein powder sinks to bottom so you have to keep mixing just to get most of the product digested."
1.0,"I know it's a cookie, but...","Quaker advertises their Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies as made of whole grain oats and a good source of fiber. It says so on the box. It also contains enough oils, fats, and butter to have one cookie make up 8 grams, or 12 %, of your daily recommended intake for total fat. One cookie. And it says so on the box.  They are soft and come separately packaged for lunch boxes. I think the separate packaging is to prevent the cookies from falling apart.  The box also says they contain chocolate and almond. I think out of the 2 cookies I tasted, there was a hint of chocolate with the taste of almond. To me, they are bland, chalky and not very palatable.  I know it's a cookie, but it doesn't taste like one and the high fat content with low quality flavor will prevent me from purchasing them in the future."
1.0,Gross,These were gross. It was like chomping down on a chunk of salt. I regret wasting my money and will not purchase in the future
5.0,Authentic taste,"So I made semi-traditional masaman (potatoes, onions and peanuts with the cocount milk) but used seitan, broccoli and peppers as I had those in the house and it was awesome.  It really tasted so much like my favorite thai restaurant it was eeire, so worth it. Also its super easy to make vegan."
1.0,Nasty! Greasy! Plasticy taste!,"We picked this up on a whim, thinking it would be nice to not have to dirty a bowl on the occasions that we pop popcorn. In my house, one less dirty bowl is a wonderful thing!  This stuff is the most greasy popcorn I've ever had! Not only that, but the big is a pain to open as another reviewer mentioned. You have to hold it at the bottom of the side, then pull the plastic cover off, and even then you only have about a 50/50 shot of it coming off in one piece. Then once you actually get it open, the popcorn has a hint of plastic to it. The top and bottom of the ""bowl"" aren't paper like a regular bag of microwave popcorn - they're thin sheets of plastic - and that taste comes through in the popcorn.  All that said, the popcorn is edible, but it's not as good as regular microwave popcorn. We'll eat this pack, but when it's gone, we'll be back to the standard microwave popcorn!"
5.0,BiAglut Gluten Free Pasta from Amazon,"I am allergic to yeast, milk, eggs, yogurt,gluten, wheat & soy.  This is really the first pasta that really taste like pasta I use to eat.  I love it and look forward to other products from this company.I am thrilled that Amazon now carries it."
1.0,Funny Taste & Broken Cookies!,"I was disappointed by these cookies, and would never get them again.  Here's what went wrong.  1. The cookies themselves are not ""engineered"" to withstand any kind of travel or transport.  Upon opening the package, over 60% of the cookies were broken, with piles of crumbs at the bottom of each tray well.  Those cookies that were spared would practically disintegrate when I picked them up.  This made for difficult eating.  2. The cookies have a very strange chemical flavor to them that I couldn't explain.  it's most noticeable in the aftertaste, but both my wife and I found it extremely unappealing.  They're also far sweeter than normal chips ahoy! cookies.  3. The cookies are small.  Meaning, if you want to feel like you really satisfied your sweet tooth, you'll have to eat far more than the recommended serving size of ...two cookies (150 cal, 7g fat, 3.5 sat. fat, 13g sugar). If you can get past the aftertaste, you'll want at least 4 to feel satisfied."
1.0,Beyond stale,"As a kid i absolutely loved the green frogs and when i saw these on sale i jumped on the deal.  Much to my disappointment i am not able to actually taste these because they are so stale.  I might as well have bought a bag of pebbles... I guess that will teach me to buy candy online, lesson learned."
5.0,High Quality,"I have enjoyed many PR's up to 30-40 dollars a pound and have a very good sense of quality. This is about an 18 month as stated. It is on the mild side which is quite special in itself. It has a fresh wonderful buttery taste of a fresh PR. There is individual merit for the various ages up to 36 months. I personally do not like the 36 months variety.  This is a bargain and to be well appreciated.  Pay the next day during the hot months.  Mt second order 2 weeks later was not fresh, dried out not the young freshness and tenderness of a 18 month - did not taste good. Why!?  We really like these cheese. The third shipment was perfect."
1.0,Terrible shipping time,"Product was distilled water so it was fine, but it took almost a month to arrive.  Will not purchase from this supplier ever again."
1.0,not able to rate....item returned to sender,"This product was returned since I intended to order canned mango, which was and has not been available, but still appearing on the web site.  I have not yet received a refund for the papaya yet, and am wondering when that will occur."
1.0,Basically coffee mate,This stuff in not NON DAIRY as it says in the description.  I bought this to replace the one I was using for my CBTL milk frother. It is disgusting.  I wouldn't even want it with a smoothie.  It tastes like powder coffee mate and the sad thing is I think the coffee mate brand tastes better!
1.0,Go Organic Dark Chocolate Bars,This is an excellent product IF fresh but the boxes I received were shipped on/past the expiration date.  Bars were stale and discolored.
1.0,Grove Square Hot Cocoa,"The product Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups arrived with an expired date of July 2012. I wanted to call or email but my husband advised to just toss it out which I did as I had bought the cocoa for our grandkids.  Sincerely, Belinda Gonzalez"
5.0,Good soup,"This is perhaps one of the best soups I have ever tasted and I got good taste buds. Actually , when I say something is delicious, other people will absolutely love it, whatever it maybe. Very good and real flavors in this soup. Trust me!"
5.0,Organic coconut oil what more to say,"This is good quality coconut oil, i use it mostly for my hair as a hot oil treatment and it is wonderful. The jar is plastic which would be better if it was glass, but not a huge problem that you can't deal with. You can use this for cooking as well and it has a nice strong coconut smell. Just good product overall, really doesn't have much to say."
1.0,Can you as a treat ...,"So thought that I read the reviews, and bought a box (small size) and chicken treats.  Small size dogs cannot eat... they're hard.  No smell without a taste.  Have two small dogs cannot left the floor."
1.0,why so expensive?,this water is supposed to sell for $2.49. why is it so expensive on this site? the one star is for the price.
5.0,best green tea,LOVE IT!!!  very tasty.  Tried many green teas and found them bland at best.  The mint and lemongrass in this one is reeeeally good.
5.0,YUM,"This is a great multi-use sauce.  Great for using as a baste when grilling - fish, chicken, shrimp, pork, etc."
5.0,much better than store brand,"i think that's the best ground coffee in a bag can do. much better than the store brands like Maxwell House or Folgers or Wegmans, etc. when it's on sale they are actually about the same price. would definitely try this brand again!  This flavor is on the strong and bold side, which I like."
5.0,Best,The best after meal digestives EVER!  I can't keep these in my home since I munch on them all the time!  DELISH!
1.0,Gave my baby a rash,"I bought these for my 10 month old daughter thinking they would be great for teething and snacking. These cookies gave my baby a terrible rash and the runs. She normally never has these kinds of reactions to food. Never again Gerber, never again."
1.0,I wouldn't buy any dog food made by Diamond (chicken soup is only one of many),"Let me preface this by saying I LOVE AMAZON. They are an amazing company and I will always shop online with them.  I had been feeding my older dogs Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul (Senior) for about a year. And about two weeks before the ""voluntary"" recall came out in April of 2012, my dogs were both extremely violently ill (vomiting, diarreah and no appetite that lasted a week - until I got them help). Both had to be seen by the vet and both were perscribed antibiotics. Shortly after these bouts of illness I learned about the salmonella tainted food in the South Carolina plant. Diamond Dog Food (the manufacturer of many foods including Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul) had denied that any dogs were sickened by this food but I am 2000% positive that they were. They said they would not accept responsibility unless I could prove it. But I couldn't because I didn't save any of their poop to have it tested (my vet's assessment was not enough for them to accept responsibility.) Also be aware that they were also involved in a recall back in 2005 (I think that's the year) that killed several dogs due to their neglegence. So this isn't the first time Diamond has harmed dogs. I personally will not forgive what they did to my dogs and to me. I also know that my dogs were not the only dogs sickened. They currently have a class action lawsuit against them for sickening HUMANS, but sadly there are no attorneys willing to represent animals in this matter.  What I find even sneakier on the part of Diamond was the timing of their recall. I actually purchased the tainted food in February 2012 and didn't begin feeding it to my dogs until April because I had a previous bag of the same food that was already open. So they knew the timing of this dog food recall was well beyond anybody being able to prove their dogs were poisoned. (They also told me that once the bag was opened, I couldn't prove it was poisoned because the bag could become poisoned/contaminated through ""other"" means...meaning they would accuse me of poisining my food and my own dogs. I had a 35 lb bag of that tainted food of which maybe only 5 lbs. was eaten.) This company is SCUM. People, if it's made by Diamond...RUN don't walk in the opposite direction!!!!  If I could give them a ZERO rating - I would...In fact I would WARN anyone who loves their animals to avoid this manufacturer once and for all."
5.0,Perfect Sun Dried Tomatoes,"I had the extraordinary pleasure to spend a week at Villa Cappelli in Terlizzi, Italy, this past May. The ancient villa on an unpaved section of the Appian Way has been restored by Paul Cappelli. It is a working home with olive groves surrounding the villa. All products are made by Paul and his 'Villa people.' Spices grow in his gardens. Vegetables sit in the Italian sun and are dried by nature. The cellar is filled with the olive oil vats. The lemons from his trees become limoncello. HIs sun-dried tomatoes are in his own EVO and are delicious. His red onion conserve is like none that I've ever had."
5.0,love this product!,"glad to find this product in quantity, arrived promptly, as described. would purchase again. Love agave, have been using it for years, would never go back to white sugar!!"
1.0,Awful!,"I hate to post negative comments about this coffee because I read a good review about the Regular blend in Consumer's Reports. In fact, it was that review that made me interested in trying this flavor. What a mistake! This ""vanilla"" flavor tastes artificial and there is a harsh, bitter aftertaste after each sip. I tried this coffee for three days to give it a chance then I threw out what was left. This was one of the worst cups of coffee I've tasted in long time."
5.0,Good product,Straight forward good product.  It work for its purpose.  The price is a little steep but you will get over it.
1.0,Warning - contains GMO soy,"This product contains non-organic MonSatan soy lecithin (banned in Europe, causes cancer and organ failure in lab rats). Organic sources of soy lecithin are presently available - no good reason to use this poison. Most of the companies that use it have been bought out by the same mega-corps that make junk food, etc. USDA organic products are allowed to contain 5% GMOs."
1.0,False advertising!,The label is misleading. Cento actually sells two kind of San Marzano with the same label other than one that says D.O.P. certified. You will receive the one w/o the D.O.P. if you order from Amazon. I have made the mistake in the grocery store not realizing Cento sells ones are D.O.P and ones that are not and did not realize till it was too late. The true D.O.P. ones I have to say make the best sauce! You can taste the difference.
5.0,Excellent but not for kids,"This tastes like real licorice candy, with a pleasant dash of real pomegranate. It has the right texture, starting out chewy and slowly melting and releasing flavor. While it is candy, not health food, the ingredients are more food and less junk than most candy.  My kids didn't like it and I suspect yours won't either. It does not have the intense artificial flavors of more processed candy, and the complex textures are more appealing to adult tastes. No one will pig out on a whole package of these, they are candies to savor. You could serve them after a good dinner with fruit, cheese, nuts and dessert wine without shame (unless your guests see the package, I suggest cutting the sticks into shorter pieces for additional deception).  Since I no longer take chocolate GORP on my hikes for health reasons, I tried short pieces of various flavors of this with raw almonds instead. I won't say it delivers the ecstasy of the original, it satisfies both tongue and stomach."
5.0,I can't believe they discontinued this!!!!,This muffin mix was a miracle maker - it made ME into a baker.  My teenage sons raved about them (they were amazing!)  Now I can't find the mix anywhere.  BJ's says Betty Crocker has discontiued them.  I'm SO DISTRESSED!!!!
1.0,Don't buy from this company,"Don't buy from this company. There was hardly any tea in the tins (they were small to begin with, and half-empty), and I'm not even sure they are Dammann teas The tea is repackaged and put into summit tea containers I feel like I just wasted $30."
1.0,Grains won't multiply,"I have tried to recover the grains with raw milk over 2 weeks, and the grains still remain yellow/orange and would not grow, but they could still ferment milk."
1.0,Do Not Buy,"Please do not use this stuff. The Xyiltol can be fatal to dogs, goats and a few other animals. Please Google dogs+Xylitol. This stuff should be pulled."
5.0,Marvelous tea - use it in your Keurig too,"A wonderful brew, but I won't repeat what everyone else has said.  What I will say is if you use the 2 attached teabags in a Keurig (just put the 2 bags all by themselves in the same place you'd put a k-cup), you get a perfect cup of tea which is equal to the K-cups for 27.9 cents a cup vs. 68.9 cents per cup for the k-cup and just as easy.  Enjoy."
5.0,Nice Finish,"I have purchased this tea several times now and I think it is one of the better ones I have tried.  I am a Dragonwell girl.  It hits most of the high notes of a Dragonwell tea, and this is probably the only one that I have found to be nice hot or iced, the others usually tasting best only hot.  It's not ""too"" anything, doesn't seem high in tannins as some other Dragonwells, yet not weak flavored either, just more down the middle, and it is a bonus to know it is organic, although that is not always a guarantee for high quality.  Teas vary in flavor according to climate variability that particular season.  Bottom line:  whether organic or not, I will pick the Dragonwell that best represents its signature qualities.  This one does, in my opinion."
5.0,good food recieved on time!,"i'm a vegan and always missed ramen from my non vegan days over a decade ago. These are vegan and a great subsitute for regular ramen. I think they are healthier although they probably contain as much sodium but the flavors are fantastic. I mixed in fresh mushrooms while the ramen was cooking and it made it even more delicious! a great buy, and it arrived on time, great packaging too! (the ramen packages were 99% whole!)"
5.0,skinny water citrus,The power citrus berry is the best flavor of all.  It is so hard to find.  I just want to be able to find enough to keep me supplied at all times for 2 bottles a day.
1.0,"I received ""Concentrated Date Juice, Sugar..."" ... tried again, got syrup","I was so excited to receive my order, considering the rave reviews. And I was so sad to read the labels on my jars -- which stated the ingredients as Concentrated Date Juice, Sugar, Water, Citric Acid."" The web photo of the label says only ""DATE."" Apparently, the maker is sending Amazon a different product to substitute for the ""pure natural"" all-date one. This substitute is just a syrup. Other reviewers seem to love it, but I wanted pure date molasses. UPDATE: Since the customers who got lucky and got the all-date product loved it, I tried again. Sadly, this time, the ""date molasses"" didn't even taste like dates; compared to my first order, this batch looked light in color, had a more watered-down consistency, tasted to me like HFCS mixed with honey, and tasted to another person like pancake syrup. I wish the manufacturer would make a pure date molasses. They make a carob molasses, but I'm afraid to try it based on this experience."
1.0,not for me,I thought this sounded interesting - and healthy. But the taste was  - is - so awful that I just couldn't drink it. I am glad I didn't buy a larger amount. Now I am stuck with 10 packages I won't use.
5.0,Great belts with a sour kick!,"These are a great deal - they're individually wrapped, so they don't get all sticky.  They're a bit thicker than the kind you'd find at a old-fashioned candy store, but they're pretty great nonetheless. There's a really strong sour kick right at the start that's great!"
5.0,Arrowhead Mills Spelt Flakes,"I've been buying this cereal since I became sensative to wheat and I absolutely love it. I drizzle a little honey on them and sometimes add banana, but they are marvelous without either."
1.0,worst first expierence,This product completely dissapointed me. Im doing the lemonade diet and i was looking so foward to this maple syrup sweeting my lemonade but boy was i wrong. as soon as i tried it tasted horrible. you get such a nasty after taste. i would never buy this again
5.0,This stuff is great,"I ate this stuff before going vegetarian a few years ago,and I eat it a bunch now. Low fat,packed with protein,super versatile in cooking and tastes great. Highly recommended!"
5.0,This is the best tea for iced tea,I use these bags exclusively to make iced tea with either an iced tea pot or hot water in a reusuable bottle.  It has the best flavor of any tea on the market and amazon has the best price and quick shipping.  This is a great item for a subscription if you use as much iced tea as I do.
1.0,"Great Product, but item near expiration","Received the items today (05/12/2012) and all 24 cans of food are set to expire (5/15/2012). Since we feed our cat a can of wet food once a day, there's no way that our 8 pound cat can finish more than 2 of the 24 cans in the allotted expiration date. Our cat loved the Beef flavor Instinct food when we purchased it from PetCo, so we seeked a better deal online and now we know exactly why it was so cheap...because you can't use it!"
1.0,Garbage,"Not only does my dog not like this, but it also gives her diarrhea.  Avoid giving your dog this food if at all possible!  There are too many bad allergens in it.  Such a shame Rachael Ray put her name on this awful product."
5.0,Excellent product,"I use organic cocoa in shakes every morning and like to control amount of sweetening I add.  This is an excellent, healthy product sold at a great price."
5.0,Bought these on bade in Texas,"These are amazing and I am starting to worry that I may have a hard time finding them again.  They are flavorful, crispy, and addictive.  I came here to buy these on Amazon and am sad that I can't.  I hope they are available soon."
5.0,Family really likes this.,"I don't know if the taste is identical to the sauce used to make the Bang-Bang Shrimp at Bonefish but it doesn't matter.  This sauce has good heat and flavor.  I can make my own but now that we've found this, why bother."
1.0,Very Disappointed,"I received this plant for Mother's Day from my daughter.  There were no flowers and looked nothing like the picture.  Like several other reviews, the plant was dead within the month, although I followed the instructions.  When watering the plant, because the DIRT was so hard, the water just ran right off, rather than soaking in.  Finally, I kept it sitting in a pan of water in addition to the regular watering.  Unfortunately, by then it was too late.  Instead of the package being addressed to me, it was addressed with my daughter's name and my address.  I do not recommend buying this plant."
1.0,too acidic,My 5 month old does not like these at all.  They make her twinge and cringe.  I tasted them and they don't taste like bananas at all.  I do like Earth's best jar food and thought that this was a good deal.  But I think that these jars have been hanging out in a sweltering warehouse somewhere... they are not good at all.
1.0,HORRIBLE. please save your money for something else.,"I read the rave reviews ad thought this could be a good snack.. WRONG. if you are reading this and debating whether to buy this or not, please do yourself a favor and DO NOT PURCHASE this. the fries came soggy and very weird-flavored. i almost thought they were wet or just super super moist. it was gross. simply inedible. i really regret not thinking twice before buying this, and I hope no one else falls into this trap."

1.0,Damaged and full of maggots,We've ordered this item via subscribe and save for a couple of months and it has always arrived damaged (usually one or two cans are opened; nothing more to report). This month the package contained a number of open cans that contained families of maggots that paraded across our bathroom floor.  Not the bonus you're hoping to get with your online cat food order.
5.0,"Very pleased, but bought it in store",The flavor is very good. Works great for baking and frying. Also a good skin moisturizer. Buy it at Costco if you can though. They sell it for $15.
5.0,SALT OF THE EARTH!,"If you think that salt is merely salt, listen up! This salt gives a flavor to food that you would have never imagined. Salt is a flavor enhancer, but this salt tastes like the Rolls Royce of them all. If you want to savor your cooking and kick it up a notch or two, I recommend sprinkling this salt on just about anything you can put in your mouth. BRAVO!"
5.0,great coffee for a great price,"Love the large size Gevalia morning roast.  It makes about 1 1/2 mugs of coffee.  Just enough to keep you going through the morning.  The flavor is perfect, not too strong and not bitter.  The three pack is a great value.  This price is way better than buying from the grocery store or department stores.  A wonderful way to start your day."
5.0,it works,"I am not the kind of person who hears about a miracle cure and rushes out and buys it. The tops of my feet and ankles were starting to hurt, I am a UPS driver and it had been a rough peak season and every year I am getting older and every peak seems to be getting harder. At first I thought I was getting gout , although the symptoms didn't quite match up. I looked up remedies online ( I hate taking prescription drugs needlessly, sometimes the cure is worse than the problem) Tart cherry juice was supposed to flush Uric acid from your system. I didn't have gout but the tops of my feet and ankles stopped hurting in about three days of using the juice. I bought tart cherry pills from Whole Foods they work but not as well as the juice. Hey it worked for me , I'll continue using it"
5.0,Cant find this at my local martins of walmart,I was glad to find this tea as for some reason my local stores quit carrying this flavor. Came with a great price and now Im stocked up.  Only issue is that the box it came in looked like it had been thrown from a plane at 1500 feet.  I know this is more of a UPS error though so no stars deducted for that.
1.0,Over-priced,Ordered this item and to my surprise paid more for shipping than the item itself.  Was very disappointed and will not order from this company again.
5.0,Great Gluten Free Instant Oatmeal,"I have been gluten free for a few years and have found this instant oatmeal to be very good.  Actually, the best one I've tried so far.  I highly recommend."
1.0,nasty taste never buy again,bought these thinking they were going to be good but was I wrong.  Had a very artificial taste to it just going to stick to plain water.
1.0,Comes in a plain brown paper bag!!!!,"Comes in a plain brown paper bag!!!! I was shocked and disappointed that this was packaged in a plain brown paper bag, no box, nothing but a plain brown paper bag.."
1.0,Nescafe a joke!,"I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, ""our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)""  Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word ""rich"" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.  It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.  I would reason that the fact your coffee costs ""4x less than Starbucks Via"" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself ""Taster's Choice""  Who's choice?  A zombie?  Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes ""the smart choice"" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice!"
1.0,Was YUMMY crispy!! but not for me...,"I can taste the cinnamon, I think I taste clove. both Nana's And Pamela's has salt. O.K for me, I don't have a lot I'm not allergic to eggs if I am then I NEED to get a different kinda Flu shot! This reminds me of Nabisco's Ginger Snaps  Ginger Snaps, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)  Use to eat when I was a kid :D AHH another food that calls me!! YING-YANG  Found out It caused GI problems for me :..( going to stay with Nana's Bites :D  Nana's No Gluten Lemon Dreams Cookie Bites, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)  &  Nana's No Gluten Ginger Spice Cookie Bites, 5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) "
1.0,Horrible!,"Not only was the taffy too hot to eat (and I love Cinnamon Salt Water Taffy normally) the customer service was even worse.  Despite what Amazon said would happen, it didn't even SHIP for 8 days.  I tried to contact them twice to find out why so long.  They couldn't be bothered to reply.  I ended up throwing out the candy.  It was a total waste of my money!"
1.0,SPONGY!!,"Sorry Tommy Maloney - I guess I am just used to eating Scottish black pudding.  I found the allspice in this product overpowering - way too strong, and the texture was spongy, kind of like sausage."
5.0,truffle oil,The oil is excellent for cooking almost anything that requires oil of any kind. It almost tastes good enough to eat all by itself
1.0,Expired,"Expired and broke my daughters braces, She should not have been eating it in the first place lol but they were as stale as a rock!!"
5.0,babys only is the best formula on the market hands down!,"I did so much research as to what formula will be best for our child. We wanted to choose organic definately and was willing to pay the cost. Then we came across this brand and instantly fell in love. I love the fact that they support breast feeding and insist babies be fed just that for first year but ofcourse we all know it is not always as easy as it sounds. I breast fed my baby for first 6 months exclusively and pumped exclusively as she would never latch. When I weaned him off breast milk, we started him on babys only organic formula. our son love it! He has never had any problems with it. No constipation at all infact he goes x2-x3 daily. I have also read some bad stuff on internet such as the recent study  condeming this formula and yet I still stand by it and will continue using it. I would say to the company, keep on making good formula for little ones but if at any chance you are thinking or doing any harm to our little ones, you must stop immediately as we all have faith in you. i bought my formula on amazon it is definately much cheaper than other places"
1.0,MY DOGS DIDN'T LIKE THIS AT ALL!!,"I tried this product on my dogs 3 times and each time, they would not touch it!  Admittedly, my dogs are picky, but no even one of them would try it.  They would walk up and sniff it, but they would not even taste it.  My dogs (3) are all small dogs and don't eat a lot of food.  Maybe if your dog is larger or less picky, it would appeal, but I can't say I would recommend this product."
5.0,Dog Loves this!,I have many different chews for my sweet 6 month old puppy Bella and this is one of the 2 she will eat in it's entirety! Thank You for such a great product!
1.0,Only got 1 sprout,"I used these in an automatic sprouter, Its on a timer and mists the sprouts as set. These did nothing, all the other sprouts did beautiul (mung, garbanzo, split pea, wheatgrass, lots others). The baby black sunflowers in the shell did great also. These were just gross. They got a slimy film on them and only 1 little seed sprouted. I would not recommend these for sprouting, however they make a great salad topper"
5.0,Tasty Product unavailable in area,"The best tasting Garlic Rye chips.  Used to be carried by Wal-Mart, but they stopped carryng them.  Found them on Amazon and immediately purchased them.  Great price, fast delivery."
5.0,My 4 cats love them!,I've been buying these since they first came out and my cats love them.  The oldest is 11 years and they obviously helped his teeth because the vet was suprised they looked so good for his age.
1.0,Bring Back the Old Recipe!,"This is one of my favorite Campbell's soups. I bought a can recently at the market and found that they've changed the recipe to include carrots and other vegetables and got rid of the spinach. The flavor is different. I don't like the change at all. The old recipe was tasty and the spinach a nice touch.  Campbell's, please bring back the old recipe!"
5.0,Jello Custard Mix,I was so happy to find  this Jello Custard Mix.  I grew up on it and was dissappointed when all the local grocery stores stopped carring the product.  The product is very is to make and still tastes great!
1.0,Keebler Pecan Sandies,"When I was growing up,  my mother used to buy these cookies for us.  They were crunchy, light and had a great flavor.  I have recently bought a bag of thes cookies and they are absolutely terrible.  How disappointing!!  They are tasteless, greasy and dense.  I will not buy again!!!!!!"
1.0,Not for me,I rated this a 1 just because I didn't care for the taste at all.  I have never purchased any raw seeds before and this might just be what it's supposed to taste like but it has a weird aftertaste and I can't get rid of these bags now :(  No one wants to take them off of my hands....
1.0,horrible advertising... no box count,this ad is meant to deceive how much boxes for 19.99... outrageously expensive if it's 3 as pictured. would never purchase from such a buyer.
5.0,My Favorite Tea!,"I don't drink caffine, and I don't generally favor Bigalow. I was introduced to this tea at a Christmas Tree Stand. It is my alltime favorite tea. Something about the smokey background flavor. Not too spicy or strong ( I like strong, but not too strong). Just really good! It is now usually my first cup in the morning. I can't find it anywhere but Amazon."
1.0,"Way less than advertised selection, even when counting decaf as a seperate flavor.","I was hoping when ordering this that it would come with many unique flavors to try, the main reason I bought the Keurig over other competing products was the selection of coffee flavors. This package does not deliver on the variety it promises. When counting each flavor without duplicates there was 21 selections, however three of these were decaf versions of the same flavor from the same company. The majority of the selections were either hazelnut or french vanilla from different companies, if you remove the decafs and choose only one of hazelnut and french vanilla from all companies there are only 10 different flavors of coffee, much less than the advertized 27. I will not be buying this selection of k cups again nor will I be buying any of ""crazy cups"" mixed packs."
5.0,Tasty stuff,"I like that you can brew it in cold water, although it's stronger in hot.  I also liked that it's unsmoked - I was reading that some of the rumors/small studies that show mate might be mildly carcinogenic were done on smoked mate, which caused me to look for unsmoked and find this.  It doesn't taste the same as smoked, understandably, but it tastes good."
5.0,Vitacost Coconut Oil Review,"It was way early in being delivered.I can honestly say after taking it everyday for the last two weeks,that I have more energy but the most amazing discovery is I have a better memory.All thanks 2 Vitacost coconut oil.And all thanks to Amazon 4 making it so I can afford it on a budget.Thanks Amazon."
1.0,Urine & Gasoline Water,"This is a product idea that has gone horribly wrong. I'm just spit balling here; perhaps this was a way to get the Arizona brand into the lucrative super water market. Something meant to be simple, but ended up being needlessly overcomplicated. It's so bad.  The tea + fruit +   combo comes out tasting like urine + gasoline + complex vitamins in a bottle with a pretty, but busy label.  If you were looking for another option to Lifewater or Hint (or even Gatorade) this isn't it.  If you are looking to have something in your house until the Zombie Apocalypse forces this to be the last beverage in your house (because no one will drink it until there are no alternatives remaining) like me, this is it.  Take this one back to the drawing board. Or just sell it to people looking for Zombie Apocalypse guaranteed to be there water."
5.0,Nigel is gonna be sad - we're out of chicken pot pie,"My cat Nigel is very into food. When I opened the first can of Petite Cuisine, he thought he'd died and went to heaven. This was bits of chicken breast, broth and a few very finely chopped vegetables. The chicken pot pie had a more watery broth - the sesame chicken was in a more gravy-like sauce - but both flavors were devoured.  My cats are big, outdoorsy cats. They were all once feral. They still frequently bring home a snake, vole or squirrel for entertainment - or supper. I have six: 4 big guys (14-17 pounds) and two slightly smaller girls (11 and 12 pounds).) They appreciate fancy little tidbits of food on a saucer. They especially liked Petite Cuisine.  They have free access throughout the day to dry kibble: Purina One Chicken&Rice and Purina Indoor  mixed half and half. We have 3 small  Petmate Le Bistro Feeders  which they love. Then in the evening I feed them 3 ounces each (1/2 can) of Friskies Salmon&Chicken Dinner Shredded. Because the Petite Cuisine cans were so small (3 ounces) I first gave them one can per cat, but that was too much. I split 4 of these tiny cans between six cats and that was just right: no leftovers. They liked the Petite Cuisine better than Fancy Feast or Purina Selects.  This package contains 24 cans. 12 cans are pot pie - 12 sesame. The price is comparable to Purina Selects, Fancy Feast or Sheba from the grocery store - but I think the quality is higher. This looks and smells like chicken my Moma cooks! At the end of one week of feeding Petite Cuisine, all of six of them - their fur just glistened.  Nigel is plotting: How to work computer and get Petite Cuisine on auto-subscribe shipment from Amazon? Hmmmmm? Bodhi just wants the A-4 Smiley Box* it comes in!  * A-4 Smiley Box - the new cat sleeping container that is delivered almost weekly by the man wearing brown. A sleeping cat's smile is on the side."
5.0,This oolong tea has perfect flavor,"There is an Asian restaurant in town that serves the most wonderful oolong tea.  I began my search for oolong tea so I could have this decadent drink at home.  After searching all the grocery and specialty stores in town, I quickly learned no one sells oolong tea!  I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon and at such a great price.  This tea has 'perfect' flavor--not grainy/grassy like some green teas; and not as strong as a black tea . . . .it has that wonderful oolong tea flavor you've experienced in your favorite oriental restaurant.  I'm ordering my second round of 2 boxes.  The hard core green tea drinkers have quickly adopted this as their favorite!"
1.0,Poor customer service,"Sticker on invoice: ""We care about your satisfaction with our products and service. If you have any concerns or questions about your shipment, please call us toll free at...""  Who would think that getting coffee could be so difficult?! We had a problem and it had been arranged that the coffee would be exchanged. They sent a Fed Ex label and off it went. After 2 weeks, a call was placed to check status. Emma (Pres) relayed the shipment would go out immediately and apologized for the delay. Thought it was done...  A few moments later, Anna calls back and goes into some diatribe with my wife not knowing what coffee is.  If the president of the company resolved the issue, why is someone else from the company calling to stir it up?!  Another call back to speak with Emma and she apologized for the actions of Anna. The coffee and a ""for your trouble"" gesture would be sent along that day. They are located cross town about 10 miles away and most shipment are next day...nothing came.  A week passed and still nothing. Another call. Emma relays that it should have been taken care of and will call me back next day to confirm. Next day came, went...nothing. We are quite disappointed by this company. They got the $$ and we received empty words."
5.0,Chocolate with a PUNCH,These chocolates are the most perfect container for the most tasty brandy I have ever had.  They are a wonderful sleeping pill at night or an evil after dinner treat.  My mouth is watering.
5.0,100 calories,These chips are so flavorful. They taste close to potato chips but they are 100 calories and about 3g fat. Much healthier. They have a great crunch and are nice and salty for when that's what you're looking for. My favorite is the BBQ a few of the others taste a little weird to me.
5.0,Yummy,"Sometimes it's hard to find just that special drink that brings the warm cozy feelings but this item does the trick. Smooth and a great price, easy to make sure all the family gets to share in all those feelings."
5.0,Somebody pinch me!!!,"I must be dreaming!!  This dip, along with the Chocolate Syrup, is saving me from wanting to cheat on a weight loss program I started a month ago!  A few tablespoons a day of this stuff (or swigs of the syrup), and I'm good to go.  I admit, it has a bit of an after taste, but it doesn't take away from the initial chocolate burst at all.  The dip is a lot like pudding, especially after being in the fridge for a while--it gets really thick and cold.  I absolutely LOVE this stuff!  HIGHLY recommended (but don't bother with the salad dressings--uh uh...)..."
1.0,No it is overpriced,"Kroger sells one for $12.00, and Wal-mart sells one for $9.99. So how is two for $41.00 a deal or ever a good price?"
1.0,This milk makes our baby really sick!! :(,"Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!! if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.  Here is our story. My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to. We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.  We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu. However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time. I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged. As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.  Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews). I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!  And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.  My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.  Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it. My wife and I are now happy again :)"
1.0,Not happy with my space stickS,I was under the impression that  STICKS was plural. I would not have paid $12 for one space STICK.  Thank You Very Much
5.0,T-disc latte,I love the iced latte I can make with my Tassimo one-cup.  Buying the 2 items necessary (espresso and the milk)separately makes it much cheaper.
5.0,Quick and easy brown rice.,"GoGo brown rice  is great!  It takes 90 seconds to cook, tastes terrific,  and makes using brown rice so easy.  A must have staple for the pantry."
1.0,Light roast not Regular!!!!!,"This is NOT the regular roast Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee that came along with your Keurig Coffee maker, but a much lighter roast. The picture is misleading and shows the k cup that matches the regular roast. The light roast has the word Noisette written under it. I ordered two boxes and received this lighter roast, I noticed the word light roast on the box as well. I complained and was told that they would send me the regular roast, but to my dismay they once again sent me the light roast. I find the light roast taste similar to run thru coffee and has a weak hazelnut flavor. I am very disappointed in this whole transaction and will order straight from the wholesaler next time. Sorry, Amazon I really love shopping with you, but ya'll drop the ball on this one."
5.0,Unbelievably delicious freeze dried apples,"I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter."
5.0,"It's pasta, plain and simple","I decided to give the whole online grocery shopping a try, as I had recently wrecked my car. I can't remember how much these are at the local walmart, but they aren't a bad price on here. Shipping was good, and its pasta."
5.0,"A ""must have"" on the spice rack","On Salad, fish, poultry, beef, soup or steamed veggies, Zatarain's Creole Seasoning enhances virtually any culinary creation. It has a lot of flavor and a nice little ""zip"" but not what one would describe as ""hot"" like Tobasco Sauce or Jalapenos. Dinner guests always want to know what that wonderful seasoning is in my food, most of the time it's the Zatarain's."
1.0,Really?,"I bought this because my son loves Bacon and always asks for ""double on the Mayo"".  He will eat pretty much anything, but this he couldn't stomach.  It was so gross!  He gave it away, and even his friend who will eat anything can't stand it.  Pretty nasty stuff, made from 2 things most people like.  Beware before you buy it."
5.0,Amazing Gum,It tastes just like Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. Since that's my favorite ice cream flavor; I love this gum!
5.0,very pleased with prompt delivery,I found the coffee a bit pricey but worth the cost- I was very pleased to get such prompt and efficent service. I was a bit suprised because of the shipping from a surgical supply firm - but had no problem at all.
1.0,Not quite was depicted,"For starters, it comes in a clear plastic bottle, not the dark glass in the picture.  Then there's the ingredient list:  Water, PROPYLENE GLYCOL, natural and artificial flavors, Phosphoric Acid.  Doing a bit of research, I find that while propylene glycol is what goes into modern antifreeze and hand sanitizers, the US FDA has determined that it is ""generally considered safe.  According to the rest of the reading, it would take a LOT to cause a problem.  But my question is: Why are we using it at all?  Is there nothing else that will do the job?  Theoretically, it's an alcohol, but then again wood alcohol makes people go blind, so...  Lots of questions, no conclusive answers.  I'll likely try a drop or two, but I wish Amazon had revealed this in the first place.  At $8.xx, it's not responsible to the carbon footprint to ship it back... but that doesn't mean I've go to like it.  EDIT: put a couple drops into some oil... it doesn't mix.  Not even a little bit.  So it is being returned.  Not worth buying, IMO."
5.0,Coffee Pods,I have been a devout believer and drinker of the Senseo Coffee Maker and coffee pods for years. I have given the coffee maker as gifts and regularly hear from friends whom I serve the coffee to state that it is by far the BEST tasting cup of coffee they have had from a home brewer.
1.0,Not a complete package!,"I purchased this wine making kit because it was advertised as having everything you need.  The contents was a mix and corks.  When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting everything I needed to make wine like the beer making kit I recently purchased.  Boy was I wrong.  Therefore I gave this product one star because I still need to buy everything else."
5.0,"Good treats, good price - popular with my dogs - see video review", These are good treats with a good crunch and apparently a good flavor.  You can see my dogs enjoying them in the video.
1.0,disappointing,"Just didn't like these - seemed like a cookie (fig newton, but blueberry) with jam in it.  Wish I could find someone that liked them so I could ditch them."
5.0,Duncan Hines Orange Cake Mix,This item is impossible to find in CT...I use it for Harvey Wallbanger Cupcakes (Modified recipe from THE CAKE DOCTOR by Anne Bynes). Came quickly! Will order more!
5.0,Fanfrikkintastic indeed!,"If you like perfect spicy bloody Mary mix, you must try it! It will make you blush! Perfect addition to your summer brunch. The flavor is great!"
5.0,Great product,My two Bassett Hounds love these things.  I wish they were slightly cheaper and I also wish the brushes on the toy were available for sell seperately.
5.0,My favorite coffeee,"Just goes to show everyone has different tastes!  The other reviewer hated this coffee while it's actually my favorite one!!  I have a subscription for it so that it's delivered to me monthly.  It is smooth, tastes good and not too strong or overpowering...which is why I love it."
1.0,Poor Substitution,"A Texas transplant to Maryland, it has been hard to find good chili mix at the grocery store.  For a brief and wonderful year, my local store carried my favorite, Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit.  Then they restocked with this stuff.  While it appears to be made by the same folks, it's AWFUL.  They've left out the onions, there's almost no cayenne pepper (they say to make it hot add the whole package, I would have needed about a half dozen of their little packages to even touch hot!), and the herbs and spices are all mixed together so there's not real sense of how much of anything you're putting in.  No problem if it's good, but since it's not...  It appears that they've upped the chili powder quotient and backed off on everythign else.  If you like chili, don't bother with this stuff!"
5.0,This is the Best Wine for the Money,"If you go into an Olive Garden Restaurant, and order a red dry wine, this is the top of the heap!  It is flavorful, correctly acid and has a wonderful finish.  After a visit to an Olive Garden near Hilton Head South Carolina, I was in love with this wine.  The Olive Garden claims that this wine is their wine and fermented exclusively for them.  Well I did the legwork and found the wine for much less of a price then offered at Olive Garden.  My find is your benefit... try it once and you'll see what I mean.  Want to talk about this wine... email me at dagardenguy@yahoo.com.  Walt"
5.0,Excellent product,"My primary reason for buying this product was to help my digestive system.  I have iron deficiency anemia, but I could not tolerate any brand of iron supplement, and the shots were extremely painful. So I became extremely anemic and needed transfusions. Consequently, I couldn't take a chance anymore on not using iron tablets and I had to find a way to take them without suffering. Because I use coconut oil and milk in my cooking and for skin/hair care, I've done research on the benefits of this amazing seed, and I thought that these capsules might help me to tolerate iron tablets.  Well they have, and I am now able to tolerate 3 daily doses of ferrous sulfate, so I'm in compliance with my doctors orders and my hemoglobin level is rising."
5.0,Great price and excellent customer service,"I made 3 subscriptions to juicy juice: 2 for strawberry banana and 1 for apple.  I received only 1 of my orders and checked UPS to find out what happened.  The other 2 were unable to be delivered due to damage.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent out the next 2 boxes for next day delivery.  Well this time Fed Ex delivered and they did a crummy job as well.  The box was crushed on the bottom, damp on the inside.  The juicy juice box that holds the 4 packs were somewhat crushed, sticky and the bottoms of the boxes were soaked.  I immediately contacted customer service again and I have 2 more shipping out.  I did make a recommendation to Amazon about improving how they ship this item as the box was way too big for this product and was bouncing around. Otherwise, my children love juicy juice, it was a great price, and the customer service was awesome."
5.0,Really Yummy,"Unfortunately, I just love the Ferero chocolates.  Crunchy on the outside and yummier on the inside. Generally I don't eat dark chocolate, but Ferrero also comes in milk chocolate.  I do limit myself on these as my husband likes them, too.  We share.hmmmm"
1.0,Yuck.,This tea is not to my preference.  I am an avid tea drinker.  This tea is bitter and I would get a better brew by gathering the grass from outside that the gardeners blew over to the edge of the parking lot and throwing it into a pot of hot water.  I didn't taste any citrus in it.
5.0,This makes that margarita that you have been looking for!,"If you have ever had one of those ""to die for"" margaritas when out, then this is probably what was used.  This is one of the very best mixes I have tasted.  And being from Texas, I have drank some margaritas!  You can't go wrong with this mix, just buy it!  You'll see."
1.0,"This ""treat"" almost killed my dog.","I have a Shih Tzu/Poodle who loves these duck treats so we've been giving them to her for a few years.  About 6 weeks ago she developed a urinary problem.  She would lie down for a nap and suddenly stand up in a puddle of water. She also began wetting the bed and seemed to have no control over it.  We took her to the vet who immediately said no more food or treats from China and sent us to a specialist who tested her for just about everything (very uncomfortable for her, upsetting for us and very expensive).  We just got the final test results back and she has been diagnosed with Fanconi's Syndrome.  There's not too much we can do except pray that the kidney damage reverses itself.  We're cautiously optimistic because since she hasn't had one of these deadly duck strips she's regained some control over her urination and hasn't wet the bed in 6 nights. Please, please, please DO NOT give your precious pet anything made in China but most especially these horrible, deadly treats. PCI Quackers Duck Tenders, 2- 1lb. Containers "
5.0,Taste treat for bowser,"My little West Highland is such a princess. With this attitude comes one finicky eater.  She refuses to eat most kibble, and I have tried many, many brands.  But, since I've discovered Etta's Liver Sprinkles, my pup has become a champion of almost anything that's in her bowl.  With only a few shakes of the bottle, what was once so unappealing to my dog, Bugee, is now by all appearances, YUMMY. I use just three (3) shakes of the liver sprinkles on top of her kibble, and I have one happy pup who can't wait to get to her food.  Paula Honey Meisner"
1.0,Won't Buy Again,"I knew I was rolling the dice with this mixed grab bag.  Based on some of the positive reviews, I took a chance.  Couldn't be more disappointed.  One third of the k cups are the cheap Grove Square  brand...some of which I immediately through away because they shook like a rattle with a dried up ""chunk"" of coffee in them.  The others sound like they have about a teaspoon of dried up indtant coffee grounds in them.  No comparison to any of the other k cup brands. Grove Square sells for approximately half the price of other k cup brands in retail stores. That is because it is instant coffee designed to look like a k cup.  Makes the purchase price of this mix really steep since one third of my k cups were these cheapies!  I tried them once before and to me they are absolutely undrinkable. Should note that the product picture and written description does not show or mention Grove Square as one of the possible brands in the mix.  I also got 4 teas, 4 decafs and about 10 flavored coffees.  Overall, a horrible mix that was not worth the price I paid.  Won't risk it again. Unless you like the taste of instant coffee or are willing to overpay per cup to get to try some other actual k cup brands in different flavors...don't buy this."
1.0,Unwanted Email,I bought some items from this company.  Somehow they got my email. Although I have asked them to remove my name from their email list they continue to send me emails. So -- do you want to order something from a company that will not respect your wishes with respect to email?
5.0,"This cheese is so good geniune greek cheese,and is the best i have ever tasted.","This authentic greek cheese assortment,contains some of the best cheeses,that i have ever tasted...The cheese is very fresh,and shipped in its own protective cooler,to preserve its freshness...An excellent buy for those who want the best.5 star rated...Great for the holidays...thank you stewart L."
1.0,Horrible,"My dog was eating this food and has had bad gas, bloody and loose stools.  We have stopped giving this to him but we are still trying to get his tummy troubles under control.  All blood tests, stool tests, and urine tests have come back OK."
5.0,"Great, portable snack","I was already familiar with the Honey Maid crackers and always enjoyed them. The flavor is always consistently good. This option is better because the box contains six individually wrapped packages with about eight or ten crackers in each pack. It's great because you don't have to open the whole box with worry about the remainder of the crackers getting stale. The individually wrapped packs would also be good for snacking on the run. It's easy to just grab a package of these and put them in your purse for later. The only drawback is that sometimes eight crackers is just more than desired for a snack and there is no way to really seal the bag to save them for later. But, overall, this cracker is a delicious snack choice, especially if you are on the go."
1.0,This Stuff Tastes Awful!!!!,"It does not taste like chocolate, not even a little bit. It does taste fermented. And burned. If it were a good, carmelized kind of burned, that would be understandable. Everyone burns the sugar now and then. This just tastes BAD. Everything I have tried it in has had to be tossed, unsalvagable. My advice: Stay away."
5.0,TASTY!,"You really dont know what oatmeal taste like till you try this. Throw your Quaker instant in the garbage; this stuff is 10x better!  Add a little butter (butter is NOT bad for you in small quantities), little brown sugar, little milk, banana pcs, lots of cinnamon (I love cinnamon) and you have a perfect b-fast or snack.  Annnnnnnnnd GLUTEN FREE! No bubble-guts from this guy!"
1.0,Its not what I ordered!!!,"I have shopped many different vendors for this type of coffee.  Liquid Nation had this coffee too according to the photo displayed and discreption mentioned.  It took a long time to recieve the coffee, and sure enough, the WRONG COFFEE type shipped.  They have shipped EXTRA BOLD, and i specifically did not want extra bold coffee.  Their return policy has very shady procedures.  WILL NEVER SHOP THERE AND HOPE no one else does."
1.0,20 percent destroyed.,"This was a good deal,  it 20 percent of the packages were opened and dumped in the box. It came quickly, but I do not like not being able to use everything I order. What a waste!!"
5.0,The best carne asada,"Hello everyone, I use this product and is the best ever. Just rub and cook, that easy. You can buy it at Food 4 Less or Albertson's. I also recomend the Chicken Seasoning"
1.0,"American ""false"" advertising in action!","If you want 100% olive oil in your mayonnaise, you'll have to make it yourself OR order it from Spain or Italy.  You can buy imported mayonnaise with 100% olive oil, but if you buy it from Kraft or obviously this brand, you are going to get the almighty SOYBEAN."
1.0,Instant Coffee,"Defeats the purpose of K-cups. It just instant coffee, and much more expensive than normal instant coffee. Either get instant coffee cheaper, K-cups that have real coffee in them for more money or just brew regular coffee."
5.0,great service,I can't always find this product in the stores and when I saw the new amazon gourmet  I did a search. Saw it and ordered 3 cases. Thanks for the great service. Would order again.
5.0,Substantial and tasty,"This is the Cadillac of the instant ramen soups- without a doubt. The noodles used by Nongshim are quality, thick, and provide decent bite. The instant soup component is flavorful, spicy, and tastes like a real broth- no artificial business here. Kimchi flavor is limited and slight, but the included bits of freeze-dried cabbage give the impression that an attempt was made.  As noted by other reviewers, the sodium is through the roof in this and other instant noodles soups. Though delicious, slurp down a bowl full of soup broth at your own peril.  As for preparation, I've found that cooking only requires adding hot water from an office water dispenser. Have not needed to use a microwave."
1.0,Misleading Description!!,The food is great and convenient to get it in an assorted pack but 18 pack means 9 PACKS OF 2. This is not a good deal and you can get these items for less as an individual purchase from almost any store.
5.0,Sugar Plums!,This is the second year I've ordered these & they didn't disappoint. I have been giving these to my daughter in her Christmas stocking for years & then last year I couldn't find them anymore- Amazon to the rescue!
1.0,"THIS BRAND IS NORMALLY VERY GOOD, BUT....","I have curry pastes from this company that are outstanding...but this particular product just isn't good at all. My hubby loves Indian, too, and he is not a picky eater--but even he told me to find a new home for the boxes we bought of this stuff! I don't know how to describe it...it's kinda vinegary and sour and it has big hunks of banana peppers in it. It isn't creamy and the texture is almost grainy. I tried to rescue it with coconut milk and it really didn't help. The ""curry"" in it is very faint and it's just...well...you might like it but we sure didn't. As I said, we've bought many other items from Amazon in this brand of Indian foods, but this is just the opposite of the other items. It just isn't good."
5.0,Just Like Home!,I was delighted to find country ham as I enjoyed growing up in NC.  Living in CA you can't get good country ham or BBQ.
1.0,Not a good one,"Compared to other delicious fast noodle I had before, this one is one of the worst ever~! Little amount of mushroom and the soup was tasted like adding some artificial ingredients. I would definitely not recommend this one. You may want to try other kinds of flavors."
1.0,I was really disappointed in this product!,"The label says it's Watermelon and Strawberry but I did not taste either one of these flavors.  I did taste adulterated grape and apple and something ""musty like"".  There wasn't really any carbonation either. With the lack of a great flavor and at 140 Calories for this tiny little can of 8.3 ounces with 36 grams of carbs and 35 grams of sugar (albeit natural fruit sugars), I'd rather have a glass of water.  It's wonderful that they do not use any added sugars or corn syrup or preservatives but the flavor and calorie count of this drink just does not justify consuming it.  Then you have to consider the high cost to buy it.....  . NO....I will not be buying this drink EVER again!  The concept of it is marvelous but the follow through...not good!!"
1.0,Worst Tasting Syrup Ever,This was sugar free Cherry syrup which you can put on snow cone or shaved ice this was the worst tasting thing I ever tried. We pitched it don't waste your money.  The regular syrup is way better.
1.0,"Stale, unpleasant","The sunflower seed kernels are stale and unpalatable; pumpkin seed kernels from the same supplier were not stale, but had little flavor.  Would not order again."
5.0,My favorite of the Vita Coco beverages is this one!,"The Vita Coco Acai & Pomegranate is the best tasting of all the flavors. It's light and tasty, the right balance between coconut water and fruit juice. I wish the 17 ounce Boxes were still available."
5.0,Fresh and tasty,"We were disappointed when we could no longer obtain Violet Crumbles in the U.S. Then we discovered the Crunchie. Almost identical but better. These bars arrived on time and is perfect condition. None of the bars broken and no bloom. Nice, light, chocolate-covered sea foam in perfect condition."
5.0,great,Great product.  I have used it as a substitute for all-purpose wheat flour in several recipes with great results.
5.0,Great!,"I just tried the Columbia Medium and I am in LOVE! I was pretty skeptical of an instant coffee but found it at the grocery market for $1 for the package of 3. At first, I thought it was going to be way too strong and bitter but I was pleasantly surprised. It was smooth and full of flavor as if I just bought it fresh at the cafe. I added Truvia to it also and couldn't have had a better cup 'o joe. I am hooked!"
5.0,Keeps mosquitos away,We've been using this product for years.  It really works.  doesnt harm the flowers.  lasts up to about 30 days per spraying. Even after a rainfall.
5.0,I like them,"I like them even though they are not too sweet.  I think that is what I like about them.  I like the fact that they are sugar free.  They do have a peanut taste to them.  A fresh roasted peanut taste.  Not all the time, just sometimes you will get some nice chunks of peanut in a bite and it will be really nice and nutty.  If they could capture that taste for the entire bar, they would be awesome.  I am not looking for a candy bar, just a protein bar to help when I can't get a clean meal after workouts etc.  It does make me feel full and satisfied until my next meal.  Also, even though it doesn't taste real sweet, it does satisfy any sweet craving I might have.  So I would definitely purchase these again.  They don't taste great but are hardly the disgusting bar some say it is.  But tastes do differ.  So in order to know if you like them, you have to try them, unless of course you know for sure that you need a really sweet bar for satisfaction.  Good luck."
5.0,Great,"This was a huge find for me. We stayed at the Hampton Inn one weekend and they serve this product there. The lady who makes it up told me the brand and I did a search to find it. Do yourself a favor, if you like Belgium Waffles, buy the 3 can order, you won't regret it."
5.0,Great treat,"These seem to be smaller, bite-size versions of the peppermint bark candy I remember having previously. They are individually wrapped. They taste great, and many people say they are one of their favorite treats. I bought this set of 3 for a party, and it worked out very well."
5.0,Low Calorie Chocolate--great with stevia!,"If you love chocolate and want to eat more dark chocolate as nutritionists recommend, but are limiting calories, this special dark chocolate is delicious.  For about 10 calories a tablespoon, you can make tasty cocoa or I like to put it in iced coffee for a mocha iced coffee with a bit of sweetener.  A nutritionist recommended stevia as a natural sweetener which is calorie free and sweeter than sugar.  Just heat up some milk, add the cocoa and stevia and for about 110 calories, you have a great drink."
5.0,Keurig B145 Office Pro,"I love it! Fast, easy and simple to use! This is one of the newer models I beleive. I was going to get the B60 because that's the one I have at work and it's good, but it was more money. This one is wonderful and I would def recommend!"
1.0,"Bitter, Weak and Thin","I have a Nespresso C100 and use the Ristretto capsules. Ordered these as I like the concept of 'ethical coffee.' Huge disappointment. I find the coffee is weak and not like espresso at all. Plus, the aftertaste has a bitter quality to it. The crema is thin with no richness. Overall, a poor substitute. If you like your Nespresso, you can try these but beware, you are not getting the same product."
1.0,lmfao WASTEFUL,these are at the dollar tree for less than a dollar you pll wasted ur money BIG TIME!!!!!!! PLUS THEY ARE NOT THAT SOUR
1.0,C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral chews,"I am sorry to say that my chihuahua did not care for these chews at all.  The first time I gave her one she started chewing, but dropped it in a minute and never try it again.  Next day I gave her another one and she turned her nose up, didn't even try it.  In all faireness I must say that she is very, very picky."
1.0,NOTHING like regular pasta,"I agree with the other reviewer, the preparation alone with these noodles would cause me to give them fewer then five stars. However, if they tasted like regular pasta with only 40 calories a bag, I could deal. Unfortunately, they are disgusting. I am a big fan of the cookbook author/food blogger Hungry Girl, and she uses these all the time so I had to try them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. They were very chewy (she told her fans this, so I was prepared for it), smelled nauseating when I opened the bag (rotting vegetables or fish smell maybe?), and had a bizarre taste. Regular pasta just kind of works as a texture filler for dishes, but these noodles had a strong and weird, chalky flavor. I will NEVER, EVER buy them again and will just settle for eating pasta dishes made with whole wheat noodles only once in a while. If you still feel the need to try them, I'd recommend buying only one bag until you know whether or not they are for you."
5.0,Yum!!,"After having a great experience with barley tea, I figured that I needed to find some bags to brew up my own tea. (It'd be cheaper, that's for sure.) What initially drew me to this brand was that the instructions are in English, which is something that is not guaranteed with each brand out there on Amazon. If you are new to brewing, this is will be easy for you to understand.  The teabags are sealed up in foil packets, with many bags in one packet, so depending on how long you'll go between usages you might want to put the remaining bags in the foil packet in a ziplock. (I know that some are especially sensitive to the difference in taste that comes from teabag containers being left open.) Each bag can be used to make 1 quart of tea.  This tastes pretty good and I loved how easy it was to make. You can either brew it with hot water or leave it in the refridgerator to brew in cold water. It's rather fast when it comes to steeping, so I was able to enjoy the tea after a few hours in the fridge.  I'm absolutely going to purchase this again when I head back to my local Asian food market."
1.0,Dissapointed,"This product is absolutely disgusting! It doesn't even taste like chicken, its got this weird citrus flavor! Bleh, a total waste of money."
1.0,Smells and Taste like Fish,"The picture is NOT the color of the salt. It smells and taste like fish.  It also has tiny rocks in it that will hurt or even chip your teeth. I only ordered it because of super saving shipping. NEVER AGAIN, I will stick with Premiere Pink Salt from Quantum Nutrition Labs WAY better."
1.0,Where's the coffee?,I bought 1 box at the local grocery ($1.29 - 6ct. box) because it is much cheaper to try.  I like strong coffee and 1 pouch of this only = ~1 tsp.  It is so light that I can't even smell the coffee.  I had to use at least 3 pouches and still not much of strong coffee taste that I would like.  Stick to Starbucks via and you'll only need 1 pouch and turns out to be much cheaper to buy on Amazon.
5.0,Excellent Healthy Cat Food,"All three of my cats enjoy this healthy cat food.  Obviously the flavor is good.  It's great to see companies producing grain free cat food (what moron thought it was a good idea to poison cats with grains in the first place?).  ""Nature Variety Instinct Chicken Formula"" claims to be 95% chicken, turkey and liver. There is no mention of ""meat by-products"".  The ingredients also include small amounts of eggs, peas, carrots, artichokes, cranberries, pumpkin, tomato, blueberries, broccoli, cabbage, kale and parsley.  I think my cats eat healthier than my son does!"
1.0,For the Dogs,"These are dog food. However, except for the name there is mention that they are animal treats at all. They sound like really healthy or gourmet human food. They are also harder than dog biscuits. Most dog biscuits will break when hit. These don't even chip. I heve threw one onto a concrete floor and it didn't drop a crumb. I wouldn't feed them to my dog."
1.0,"Such a dissappointment, really bad.","It started raining this morning and I was feeling the hunger.  Hmm...Yes! Snow's Authentic New England Style Clam Chowder.  Into my fave cast iron pot. Heated up and into a bowl.  Wait. What is this? So much for my clam chowder dance I did in the kitchen as it heated up.  Pretty thin. Not too thin, but not thick like an ACTUAL clam chowder.  Flavor: Bland. Very.  I ate the entire bowl nonetheless, (hate wasting food)  I kept thinking, where are the clams!!!!  I think I bit down on one. It looks NOTHING like the picture either.  Blech! The worst clam chowder I have ever had in a midwest diner beats this.  Very bummed."
5.0,Mommy Shopper,I love these way more than the Gerber brand because my son would eat three or four of the smaller ones. These are perfect size for a snack and are just as healthy!
5.0,A taste of home,"Moving to Michigan from NYC meant a lot of changes.  It is like moving to another country and there were many things I missed.  I was thrilled to find Dr Brown Diet Cream Soda available!!!  I ordered a case and every time I open a can, I can close my eyes and feel like I'm sitting in Juniors with my friends.  Heaven!  For me this is a smooth and delicious treat after a tough day."
1.0,Gross!,"This is one of the most disgusting Hamburger Helper Meals. The glaze was so sweet, it reminded me of lemon cookies. The pasta wasn't good either. NO flavor what so ever of lemon and herb chicken. Overly sweet and lemony grossness is more like it. What a waste of $2.50 and not to mention my expensive chicken breasts."
1.0,Both dogs completely uninterested,"I bought this bone for my 2 dogs- a greyhound who is an aggressive chewer, and a border collie who's more interested in taste (he likes to just lick rawhide.) I had hoped this would prove a longer lasting alternative to rawhide for the greyhound, and if not, I thought at least the other dog would like it. Well I bought this weeks ago and so far I can't convince either dog to be interested. As far as they're concerned, it's a flavorless hunk of plastic."
1.0,"No cinnamon taste at all, tastes like plain mate",I am very dissapointed in this Mate. It said it has cinnamon and other flavors however it doesn't taste like any flavor at all compared to other mate blends I've tried. I was expecting at least a little flavor but it tastes bitter just like regular unflavored mate.
1.0,Should have read the reviews!,Ordered 3 boxes of purple; got 1 purple and 2 blue.  Sent back two and ordered replacements.  Got one purple and one blue!  Just read the reviews and see that this is a common problem!  Very disappointed!
1.0,Disappointing!,"This does not at all taste like espresso. It is very weak in flavor, almost no flavor, and is light in color not like dark espresso roast. I wish I could return it. If you want something to taste like espresso do not buy this! I also bought the decaf espresso and had the same disappointing experience."
5.0,Why look any further?,"I am reluctant to say anything about this product because I don't want to share it with anyone.  I found a recipe for pizza crust that required semolina flour. Having never used semolina before, I searched amazon and found 12 pounds for $18. While at first it seemed like way too much flour, the 2-pound bags are easy to store in the pantry, fridge or freezer until you need them.  My pizza crust is now much improved, and I've made dinner rolls with semolina, too. Friends rave about my pizza, and the rolls were a big hit. ""How'd you get them so yellow and creamy?"" they ask. I smile and say it's an Olde family recipe! (I've never met any of the Olde family, but I will praise them here, in print, just in case any of them are reading this!)  In the end, its flour, and it behaves as you would expect. It imparts a delicate aroma to your baked goods along with a yellow tint. It is not as finely-ground as all-purpose flour, nor is it as couarse as cornmeal - it's texture is somewhere in between. And unlike cornmeal, it doesn't burn when used on a hot baking stone. Sprinkling semolina on your peel and proofing your loaves makes it easy to transfer them onto the stone.  I have not used any other semolina flour, and I am unlikely to do so after discovering Spicy World.  Finally, I challenge you to find semolina for less than $1.50 a pound!"
5.0,Awesome!,"The tea sampler is the best. You get four of each flavor, and each one has been great tasting. I am just getting into the 3rd trimester, so this tea has been very helpful. Especially the heartburn and peaceful mama tea! Plus the price on Amazon is great!"
1.0,Worst Valentines day gift ever,"Unfortunately, basically everything in this box was horrible.  The yogurt pretzels were stale, the caramels tasted like chalk, and the popcorn was pretty bad too.  I liked the milk chocolate truffles, but there are only three in this box.  Save yourself some money and trouble and spend it better elsewhere!  (and being a foodstuff, this product cannot be returned!)"
5.0,LOVE!,"The dogs went wild for these treats!!  I was so happy to find a ""natural"" treat for the dogs since my younger dog was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and we did a major diet overall (along with extra vitamins and the such) -- the dogs are thrilled with these....great price and lasted quite a bit too!"
5.0,This stuff is fricken awesome,"My hubby got this because it was on sale. We made it as a snack while watching late night TV. I actually went online to make sure we followed the directions correctly. The cooking instructions on the packaging were difficult to read. The final product was soooo delicious. If one were to think that fiddle faddle is edible; this caramel corn ROCKS!! After cooking the popcorn, I would suggest doing the best you can to eliminate all of the kernels. Then cut the caramel into several pieces (we did 8) and then place them on top of the popcorn; which is in a microwave safe bowl. After about a minute more in the microwave, take out and mix well. Easy Peasy. Enjoy."
5.0,chocolatini mix,"This drink mix is fabulous! Bought this at Home Goods on a whim..was having some girlfriends over..we loved it! They have been searching everywhere to buy it and keep it on hand..so happy to have found it on Amazon!!! So easy to make, and not overly sweet!"
5.0,Best Fajita Marinade,This marinade makes the best fajitas ever. I have looked all over eastern US to find this product. I will always have a supply on hand.
1.0,Stripped the color right out of my hair,"And thankfully I was on the tail end of the color cycle and almost time to schedule an appointment or I'd be seriously ticked. I've only used it twice and I'm practically back to my natural color and the gray is out in full force! The shampoo arrived in a padded envelope, but also wrapped in plastic. Mine hadn't spilled over as others have mentioned, but there was a strong odor just opening up the envelope. The shampoo is very thick and gooey and doesn't take much to get a good lather going. It seemed to clean well enough, but my hair felt dry and wanted conditioning - which it normally doesn't need as I don't blow dry much. I'm going to stick with the color safe shampoo I've been getting from the salon, and free or not, this product is headed for the dumpster."
1.0,Dog doesn't use it at all,I thought this would be fantastic to keep my puppy busy but she just chewed the knob off the rope insert (ours was rubber) and that was that.  She won't play with it at all.  She is highly food motivated but this just doesn't do it for her.  Give her a Bully Stick and that's really something though!
1.0,NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS PURCHASE!!!,"I am SO NOT happy about purchsing this item. It is NOT as described. What the description says is ""Italian Basil, Purple Basil, Chives, Dill, Mint, Parsley & Thyme,"" what I got was Genovese Basil, Thyme, Mint, Lemon Basil, Oregano, Dill, Global Basil. I'm EXTREMELY angry that I did not get what I ordered. If they were going to make a substition, they should have asked. If automatic substitions are their policy, they should state that in the description. If the description is wrong, THEY SHOULD FIX IT. This item has been listed with this description for MONTHS before I purchased it. If I had wanted 3 kinds of basil, I would have purchased the basil mix. I expressly wanted the chives and the parsley. Buyer beware."
1.0,No Longer a Good Deal,"When I first signed up to buy this product through the subscribe and save program, it was a great deal averaging around $3.00 per box vs. $5.00 in the grocery store, but Amazon cancelled that subscription saying the product was no longer available through the subscribe and save program.  The price that's listed here is ridiculously high.  Unless you are in an area with no grocery store, why would you pay this exorbitant price?"
5.0,A Wonderful Treat,I buy at least a case of this tea every year so I have some all year long and for gift giving.  Most of the people who have received it say that they enjoy it too.
1.0,"Try out one, before you buy a bunch.","Our baby had a REALLY hard time adjusting to solid foods due to an overactive gag reflex.  In my desperation to make sure she got some protein in there, I ordered the large quantity of these. What a mistake. She hated these, and after I tried them, could see why.  The flavor was awful and the texture was really not beneficial to what i would consider Stage 3 foods.  We also saw a food specialist about our daughters issues and they mentioned that the ""Stage three"" foods are really not good for development.  They mentioned focusing on non-processed foods, and more foods that we would eat.  (not cooking something special every meal)  Unfortunately all of these went into the trash or were donated.  Would not recommend, buy again or give as a gift."
5.0,Cherrio,I love cherrio my very favorite cereal morning noon or night even for snacks I don't know what else to say  but love it
5.0,Delicious,"The belts were fresh and tasty, just like the candy store used to have. The cases were cracked when they arrived in the shipping box so it seems from some of the other review its pretty common, but didn't affect the quality. 1 order is 2 tubs, which last a long time. I do not recommend vaccum sealing to keep some fresh as the vaccum smashes the belts together and makes them hard to peel apart. Ziplock bags work much better."
1.0,BUYER BEWARE,"Hero Black Cherry ""Preserve"" 12oz is what is displayed on the Amazon website.  However, what you will receive is Hero Black Cherry ""Fruit Spread""  The Hero Preserve is made in Switzerland.  It is very good  The Hero Fruit Spread is made in Germany.  It is very Tart.  I have complained about this difference to Hero and their Quality Control was going to address the differences........but they haven't!  I was unable to find the Hero ""Preserve"" in Texas so I ordered it on line only to find they supply the German ""Fruit Spread""..........  It would be nice if Hero would get their act together and Amazon would change their web site to reflect what is sold......."
1.0,"Made In China, Will Be Returned","Unfortunately, I read a review here that states these treats are made in China. I was not aware of this before ordering. My policy is to never, never, never give your loved ones pet products (or any kind of food products IMO) from China. They don't care about what goes into their junk. After the melamine and other scandals, they can't be trusted!! Here's more: [...].. I will return this as soon as it arrives. I should know that if it doesn't say Made in the USA, it is likely from China and to be avoided. Search the literature yourselves if you wish."
1.0,Horrible taste.,"I bought this for something new to try at work, as me and my coworkers usually take turns bringing in coffee and they don't mind trying something new now and then. First, after making it, the whole office smelled of burnt chocolate and coffee. The smell was really nauseating. Most of my coworkers were brave enough to try it out despite the smell, and none of us enjoyed it. To me it tasted like hot water and a hint of burnt chocolate. Pretty much no coffee taste. Out of the 7 or 8 of my coworkers who tried it, I could not find one person who enjoyed it. I could not even give this coffee away, ended up tossing the whole canister. I definitely do not recommend this."
5.0,The Munchy My Dogs Love,"My dogs, 5 of them all love the munchy csticks. They each get a couple after their meals, which gives them a little treat and helps to clean their teeth."
5.0,smooth and delicious,"A smooth blend of black, green, and oolong.  Both healthy and delicious in one teabag."
1.0,Ingredients are not all-inclusive,"First of all, the ingredients listed on Amazon are not nearly as complete as the ingredients listed on the actual bag. One of my dogs is allergic to peas and carrots, both of which are in the ingredient list on the bag, but not listed on the site.  Secondly, one large ""SmartBone"" takes my large breed dog no more than 5 minutes to devour. At three dollars a bone, this is way too expensive."
1.0,Expires too soon,I just got this product and the expire date is for March 2012!  That's crazy.  Not to mention how long the product took to get to me.  I ordered several other things on the same day and this order came more than a week after everything else. Will not buy again!
1.0,Not a fan,"They were too dry and thin for my liking.  Although I did like the little bit of filling they provided, I wanted more, probably due to the amount of air pockets noticed.  I will not purchase in the future."
1.0,disappointed,"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni"
5.0,Will Never Buy At A Pet Store Again!!,"Petco sells the same thing packaged in smaller packaging and labeled as cat treats at an insane amount of money! I was so pleased to find them here. This saves me money, time and driving. Couldn't be more pleased!"
1.0,Not worth it,"This item was much smaller than I expected. It is a Christmas gift for someone else, so I cannot say what the quality of the chocolate itself is, but the quantity is definitely lacking for something that costs $22!"
5.0,Great for cats too!,"Since they don't offer the beef flavor for cats, I bought these just on a whim.  Well, I can actually get 3 pills out of one pocket from these and not only does that make them more economical, the cat loves them too!  They look disgusting, if you can catch my drift, but once you get past that, they're a great find.  Highly recommend!"
1.0,Dont know,"I dont know if they are good or bad because they are not here, its Thanksgiving day and I have had the other part of the order since last Friday and these where ordered at the same time, I tried to get a return lable but amazon said no returns, so not only did I have to make a trip to the store this morning I get screwed on a return, I really dont like some of the ""new"" amazons ways."
5.0,Delicious!,"My Grandmother used to give this exact box of candy every Christmas.  I was so excited to see the familiar box on Amazon.com! The candy tastes exactly as I remember it, but the pieces are much smaller and the edible paper on the sides is much lighter.  It was still good enough for a great trip down memory lane!"
1.0,Outrageous price increase,This product used to be affordable but with the price increase and for fewer boxes it is definitely not worth it.
5.0,Satisfying,"It's no chocolate milk, but for what it is, it has a decent taste & it's very satisfying. I have one of these whenever I'm hungry and want to eat something light and healthy or when I come in from running & need to refuel fast. Definitely gona order some more of these!"
1.0,seal was broken on arrival - powder all over in box,"I really wanted to try this for my daughter.  Unfortunately it arrived with the seal broken and powder spilled out into the box.  I tried to process a return to get a new sealed container but this item is ineligible for returns.  I left packaging feedback about the issue and have not gotten a response.  I really hope I can get a replacement, this stuff is not cheap.  I gave this one star because we could not try it.  I will update if we get a replacement and can try it.  We have used the berry flavor.  I think it tastes terrible because it is very very sweet with an artificial sweet taste but my daughter will eat it mixed with plain unsweetened apple sauce."
1.0,Usually like these...not the last box though,"The last box of these bars tasted ""off""  I wasn't sure why at first, but about half of the bars in the box were not sealed in their wrappers.  They may have simply been rancid."
5.0,Yum!!!,I really liked this dark chocolate combination with the Fleur de Sel.  If you like sweet & salty you will like this bar.  It does contain 19g sugar per serving (4 squares)...so eat in moderation.  I would suggest that people check their local grocery stores for it.  Mine had it for $2 a bar.  So I will not be buying this online.
5.0,Great Sampler of Decaf,I recently purchased a keurig brewer and was looking to try some decaf choices. The brewer came with a sample starter pack but only had 2 decaf k-cups.  Amazon was the only place that I could find such a large sample pack of decaf. Overall I've only tried 3 of these kcups and they were all decent and about as good as decaf will get. Some reviews mentioned the box is unpleasant looking. Not in my case. The kcups came in a nicely printed sample pack that would be perfect to give to someone as a gift. Looks like they changed the packaging for the better.
1.0,Lasted 5 minutes,"We gave this to our 35 pound mutt who went after it with determination.  he really liked the texture of the product and seemed very happy with it.  however, he chewed off two clean corners in all of five minutes.  this is about the time it would take him to chew through a 5 dollar product.  we are very disappointed that this product, which is rated a 9 on the tuffy scale, and cost a good amount, did not last up to FIVE MINUTES of chewing.  dont waste your money."
1.0,Did not ever receive this order,"Usually I get everything I order from Amazon in timely manner and in good quality. This item was debited from my account, but I never received it. Now I am in the midst of a ""WHERE'S MY STUFF"" situation. So sad."
5.0,Amazing stress relief,"I have been dealing with stress every now and then. I went grocery shopping today looking for a new flavored tea to try and I came across Tension Tamer. I thought I would give this tea a shot since I really need something to help with my stress.. and it had some flavors in it that I love (lemon and peppermint) When I got home I decided to make a cup right away since I had a pretty stressful day.. As soon as I poured hot water on the tea bag and took a whiff of the scented steam, it had a nice very soothing lemony scent! When I took the first sip I was amazed! I slowly with each sip started to become relaxed, it's incredible! This tea sure is a Tension Tamer! Although I don't taste peppermint, or licorice.. (maybe I'm brewing it wrong?) But this tea is fantastic I must say! Highly recommend it to people that suffer with stress and love lemon chamomile flavored teas! Tastes Great with honey in it too! :) Although I don't recommend this to cat owners since it has catnip in this tea, your cats may go crazy lol"
1.0,Ruined,"When did the rooster on the box get a cartoony face? Whatever happened to that wonderful abstraction? First they ruined Tony the Tiger, now this.  And where did all the high fructose corn syrup come from? Admittedly, it is a flake of corn but that is a nasty ingredient to be skipped at all costs.  It's things like that which drive people to the formerly odd grains like spelt and kamut!"
5.0,Fantastic and versatile!,"I am a HUGE fan of Indian food, and have been testing out Indian convenience products for years.  This is BY FAR the best and most authentic!  As a nutritionist, I am pleased that the ingredients are compromised of ""whole foods"" - no nasty preservatives.  It is good prepared ""plain"", but I have experimented with putting in diced bell peppers or frozen spinach with a bit of red pepper - delicious!  The directions can be a little vague - bring the ingredients to a boil and then cover for 25 minutes.  I then put the lid on askew to let moisture out (but the mess in) over high heat for 5 minutes or more - this is crucial to the thickening of the sauce.  I especially love that the 30 minutes it takes to cook is conveniently the same amount of time it takes to book Basmati rice :)  I love this so much that I put it on my auto-order subscriptions on Amazon!  We make this at least every other week for a quick, delicious, healthy dinner."
1.0,stale,I've gotten Yummy Chummies many times before for my dog who loves them.  This time I ordered them on line and paid quite a bit more for them including shipping.  When I received them I opened them to give one to my dog I found out they were very hard.  Not soft and chewy as they advertise and I'd found them in the past.  :-(  I'm not sure I'll order them on line again.
1.0,too sweet,"I guess I should have known that a ""brown sugar"" jerky would be sweet but thought I'd try it. Yep, turns out too sweet for my tastes."
1.0,much too greasy,That pretty much says it all.  I couldn't even stand touching them.  I've bought pigs ears for decades and these are the most greasy I've ever tried.
1.0,"Just sweet, no flavor","Had purchased this years ago and didn't care for it, but thought now w/Splenda and the good reviews, it had to be good.  Wrong.  They get you to bite  w/the Kahlua on the label, but there is no comparison to Kahlua, doesn't taste at all like Kahlua.  Actually it doesn't really even taste like coffee.  It has just a sweet artificial flavor, but not a coffee flavor.  Very disappointing."
5.0,Great quality product,"I am not a fan of pepper, never have been.  Salt has run my life for many years and in some ways still does, however given that my family has a history of maladies, I decided to get a little better with my diet, starting with the additives I put in my foods.  The first thing I looked at was trying alternatives to plain salt as I knew it wasn't doing my body any good, but plain pepper just doesn't do it for me.  This pepper was highly recommended by a number of people, and grinding one's own pepper into a fine blend was the recommended method of spicing one's food.  I use it with  Cuisinart SP-2 Stainless Steel Rechargeable Salt and Pepper Mills  (which have issues - see my review on that), and set to fine, the pepper has a unique taste to it, far superior to black pepper.  IT's hard to describe, but it just tastes like a sweet peppery...something.  Not too strong, but enough to give you that different flavor you might crave.  Recommended if you're a fan of grinding your own pepper or you just want to try something new."
1.0,Contains GMOs! We say NO!,"Kellogg's Corn Flakes cereal contains genetically modified organisms which have been patented by chemical companies that genetically engineered them in a lab and turned them into EPA registered pesticides. GMO Bt corn is an EPA registered pesticide and is one of the ingredients in this product. They are also made to be resistant to high levels of a chemical called glyphosate, an herbicide, which is linked to birth defects, cancer, organ damage and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has insecticidal properties and kills off beneficial gut flora. These GMOs have not been subjected to independent, long term, peer reviewed studies to prove that they are safe. These GMOs make my family sick. We do not pour pesticides on our food and we no longer eat anything that is an EPA registered pesticide.  GMOs are linked to organ damage, faulty insulin regulation and obesity, autoimmune disease, autism and a whole host of other health and environmental problems. Kellogg has contributed $632,500 to a propaganda campaign in California which is spreading lies to convince people that they should vote again GMO Labeling (prop. 37) in California on Nov. 6th because they don't want you to know that Corn Flakes contain GMOs. Corn Flakes are NO LONGER G-R-RRREAT. 50 countries around the world require that GMOs be labeled. Kellogg does not use GMOs in these countries. We are boycotting all Kellogg's products. Join GMO Free USA, a grassroots consumer email initiative that is contacting Kellogg en masse with emails to tell them to Just Label It or remove it. Americans have the right to know what's in their food! [...]"
1.0,2 week expiration,When I received these key lime snaps I noticed they were ready to expire.  There is no way we can eat 6 boxes of these in 2 weeks.  They are very good and have a great taste.  I am very upset about this product.  I have never had a problem with any products I have bought on Amazon.  I hope Amazon does something about this. A very upset and disappointed customer.
1.0,"Doesn't taste anything like apples, and did something to distort the taste of anything I ate with it","My local market was selling this, and I figured I should try a box before buying it in bulk from amazon. Glad I did. I had a 1 tea bag of the stuff and now I'm wondering who I can pawn it off on. This doesn't taste ANYTHING like apples, and the food I was eating tasted different AFTER I drank it than it had before. The tea did something wonky to my taste buds."
5.0,Excellent Tea,This is the first Oolong tea that I have tasted. I found it enjoyable with a mild and delicious flavor.
5.0,SMOOTH  Tasty  Coffee,"I checked out the Peruvian from DIrect Coffee from Amazon then I purchased a lb of the  100 %  KONA.  Even  when I perc stronger by using less water. it is smooth and non acidic.  Also makes a great cop with a single serve Keurig.  The Peruvian has a slight  grassy after taste not objectionable just different.  I' like a  true medium roast which really works with the KONA. I'll try the Jamaivan blend next and report  on it.  So far KONA leads in my taste test,  I like coffee that isn't bitter. so both are good choices.  If on the road try the restaurant that has a little girl on the logo. It is also smooth even if it is darker than what I roast at home."
1.0,Lots of dogs getting sick from this product (including mine),"Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their ""formula"" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years."
5.0,Fantastic truffle butter!,"The ingredients are simple and natural: Wisconsin butter, Salt, Truffle Oil, White Truffles, & Natural Flavorings yet a little of this butter goes a long way to impart an earthly garlicky flavor in your food. Arrives tucked in cold packs and lasts a long time in the freezer. The butter is filled with bits of truffle you can see and taste. I think their secret is whipping truffle oil into the butter to enhance the flavoring. Regardless of the secret, it's a potent and tasty truffle butter."
5.0,THE HIT OF THE LADIES GET TOGETHER,"This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season. I used Strawberries, Peach and Nectarine Slices and Rasberries. Make certain that you mix it up and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour prior to serving so the flavors can mingle. It is that simple. Then you too can be the hostess of the hour!!!WOW. Am I glad I found this!!!  I put it together very quickly...it only took 5 or 10 minutes to find a fancy bowl and serving plate. Then, I mixed up the dip using half Sour Cream and half whipped cream cheese. It only took one cup of each. I made it up the night before because I wanted to be absolutely certain the flavors mingled and mixed as much as possible. I stored it overnight in Tupperware, then the next day popped the dip into a beautiful cut glass dish. I put that in the middle of a large decorative, serving plate and surrounded the cut glass dish with fruit. Every single person commented on how good this was.  It is quick, not expensive, and looks really pretty. If you are the artistic type, I imagine you could decorate or garnish this dip (the photo on the package shows it decorated with mint leaves) and make it look really smashing.  I have already ordered more and plan to keep this flavor, or some flavor appropriate to the season, on hand at all time. It has become an instant staple in my pantry. Give it a try and I think that you too, will become an instant ""star hostess"", and will keep it on your pantry shelves. This was an absolute blessing of a find. Hope you enjoy it nearly as much as I and my friends have!!!!!"
1.0,Flavorless and like rubbery!,The product was stale and rubbery like. They were flavorless as well.  I would not recommend this specific product to anyone.
1.0,The unflavored ice milk of tea,"As no one has reviewed this, I thought I'd take the plunge and be the first. I'd like to give it a bad review, but ""bad"" would imply it having some qualities to describe. This tea can no more be ""bad"" than distilled water can be bad--there is essentially nothing to like or dislike about it.  It was a bad sign when I opened the bad and smelled...nothing. But that doesn't always mean much, so I brewed up a pot, using about a tablespoon for a 14-ounce mug. I tried it after a couple of minutes and it didn't have much flavor, so I gave it another two or three minutes...still nothing. While it develops a lovely color and is composed of what open into large leaves, it has no aroma, no flavor, really no distinguishing characteristics at all. At work later on, I filled up the strainer in my three-cup Chantal teapot and gave it a good 10 minutes. It's possible some flavor may have developed, I'm not sure. I could have been imagining it.  And now I'm stuck with 2.2 pounds of this stuff. I'd better develop a taste for a nice, hot, steaming cup of water, because that's what I'll be having for quite a while.  I previously purchased the Malden sencha; it's more than adequate.  Fine Japanese Sencha. Premium Gourmet Loose leaf Green Tea. Net Wt: 1/2 lb."
1.0,Blech,"I purchased based on reviews here and was very dissapointed. I had just finished a bulk order of Bigelow Earl Grey from here at amazon, and it was REALLY good. I just thought, oh, a boutique tea with good reviews ought to be better...NO. Save your money and go with the Bigelow (Bigelow Earl Grey Tea, 40-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)), no kidding."
5.0,Measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee,"I have been drinking Melitta's Hazelnut Creme Brulee ground coffee for a bout a week.  I find it pleasant, complex, and fills the kitchen with a very pleasant smell.  The grounds have very fine grind, however I had no issues with it plugging up the filter. I have been experimenting with the amount of grounds I use for each cup, and I found that I like a heaving measuring cup.  So a little more than I use for my favorite Green Mountain Hazelnut coffee. If I use less the coffee is a little weaker than I like, if I follow the instructions on the package (2 teaspoons per 6 oz cup) I find it a little too strong.  I would recommend experimenting to find just the right strength for your own taste.  I love flavored coffees and Melitta measures up well to my favorite Green Mountain coffee, while being less expensive.  I will be ordering it again in the future.  Ali Julia review"
1.0,Old marzipan,"I had never tried marzipan, but had always wanted to.  While shopping on Amazon, this caught my eye, so decided to try it.  I hope this is not what marzipan is supposed to taste like.  I can taste the almonds, but have to get past the old, stale smell and taste first.  If marzipan has a ""best if used by"" date, the one I had was WAY past that date."
5.0,"Tastes great, but price is way too high.","These Glory brand beans with potatoes taste wonderful.  I don't usually like green beans much, but the way these are seasoned makes them taste great.  (It's a salty and bacon-y flavor that is hard to describe.)  I especially like to use them as an ingredient in shepherd's pie.  The only problem I have with them here on Amazon is that the Amazon price is roughly 2 times higher than the price in my local grocery store."
1.0,One sip was enough,"I was intrigued by the claim that this non-carbonated but caffeinated drink would actually burn calories although I wouldn't quite know how to really prove or disprove that it does. But I found it interesting enough to order this ""dietary supplement"", as it says on the can. At the very least I figured it would be healthy (green tea and acai) and taste great given that it contains: No sugar, no Aspartame, no preservatives, very low sodium, no high fructose corn syrup and no artificial colors or flavors.  But I was in for a surprise - it tasted awful. Imagine a can of carbonated soda that was opened and then sat out on a table for a day and you get a pretty good idea of what this tastes like. Very flat and simply not good. Both my husband and I tossed it after just one sip. Even if it burned double the calories it claims to burn, I highly doubt I could down the entire 12 oz or even just a third of it. Maybe if it were carbonated that would help but honestly: Save yourself the money, this is NOT good."
5.0,Sprinkle on just about anything,"If you compare the price of this to one of the bigger-name American spice producers like Durkee or Spice Island, prepare to be shocked. Especially when you consider that the big named ones have sat on the shelf longer than this one has. What makes me the voice of authority? I am a buyer at a small grocery store.  Price aside, this curry is far superior. Just smell it! Divine... Yes, it is a bit saltier than other curry powders out there; just keep in mind that you don't need to add any more salt to a dish. A quick meal can be made by dumping a good measure of this curry powder in a pot with  Thai Kitchen Unsweetened First Pressing Coconut Milk (95% Organic),13.66 -Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)  and whatever veggies/tofu/meats you have on hand. Basically, you just stir, heat and eat. For a lip smacking snack, sprinkle the curry on sweet potato fries. Yummy! I've also tried a bit mixed into my egg salad, tuna salad and macaroni & cheese with wonderful results."
5.0,Sarah's Tuscan Sea Salt,"We enjoy this salt mixture on roasted vegetables, grilled meats, and whatever I think to put it on.  We originally got it in Oregon and when it was used up... I went looking and found it here.  What a relief... we are happily using it again and our food has perked up!"
1.0,Nasty tasting stuff!,Too bad I couldn't have ordered just one can. It tastes horrible. Hopefully someone at the food pantry will like to have the rest of the case.
5.0,Popchips are the bomb!,"I love these things!  Not only are they healthy, they're sooooooo good!  I love potato chips with flavor, and these have flavor that pops!  Original flavor has just the right amount of salt (and I like salt), and all the other flavors are just spot on too!  But check out the nutritional information --- compared to regular potato chips, these are like eating spinach!  And if you're like me and sometimes eat an entire bag, it's only 360 calories!"
5.0,"Love the stuff! Great price, too.",I have been using a the Senseo for several years now. Love the coffee. I just can not drink regular coffee out of a coffee pot anymore; it tastes gross to me now. This is a GREAT PRODUCT at a GREAT PRICE.
5.0,love this spice,I usually order the regular or original spice blend.  I actually ordered this cider one by mistake--but it is very good as well.
5.0,have a cup,"The first time I tasted this tea was about a year ago, and since then it has become my favorite. Never bitter, very consistent."
1.0,Not at all what I was expecting! Smells and Tastes NASTY!,This tea is terrible.  I read other reviews before purchasing.  Other reviews compared it to the cheesecake factory mango iced tea.  This tea is NOTHING like it.  It has a fowl smell and tastes just like it smells. I doubt I will ever drink any mango flavored tea again after this.  There is no way I can drink it and it is not returnable.  I never write product reviews but was so disappointed I had to in this case.
5.0,Great gum,Very tasty gum and the xylitol is wonderful.  My youngest daughter's dentist recommneds that she chew xylitol gum 3 to 4 times each day to help prevent cavities.  Her baby teeth had a cavity in every tooth along with three crowns!!!!  Her adult teeth seem to be much more cavity resistent and I believe the gum is helping prevent the cavities.
1.0,don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this product if you are looking for decent coffee flavor in an instant coffee...buy Starbucks instead. I used 2 packets in 8 oz. of water, double the amount called for, and still had a beverage that tasted nothing like coffee...more of a nutty flavor. I gave the remaining coffee to a 90 yr. old pal of mine who must drink half-strength coffee...perfect for her"
5.0,Great product,"My kitty is a little messy so I needed one of these. All the local pet supply stores do not carry these any more. I was happy I found this seller on Amazon.com. Mpw my rugs can continue to be saved.  Product is as advertized. Very durable, I even wash it in the washing machine on cold water. : )"
5.0,Best donut shop coffee in a K Cup,"This coffee blows all other donut shop coffees away. The medium roast, smooth taste, and energizing aroma are the three best features. Absolute best K-Cup coffee out there in the light to medium roast (& unflavored) category!"
5.0,Yum!,"Grove Square Single Serve Cappuccino Cups, French Vanilla, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count  I was concerned it would taste watered down, but I think this is delicious.  The caramel flavor in this brand is excellent, too."
1.0,waste of money  -- just didn't work at all.,"Repeating:  it was just a waste of money.  It didn't work at all...and yes, it was set up according to the directions.  We have yet to trap the first mole....and there are mole tracks all over our yard."
1.0,Higher in sodium than company claims on their website,"I'm only giving 1 star because I can't use it! And also for the extremely bad customer service of the company it comes from. Before ordering I checked the nutritional information on their website, and they state that 1/2 a cube is 123 mgs. of sodium. I also checked another website that sells it and got the same info. I then decided to purchase through Amazon because the shipping rates were better. The only downside was, I had to buy 8 boxes--but I figured that would be ok because I would eventually use it. When it arrived, I noticed the sodium content on the box was 192 in half a cube. That's a LOT of difference for someone like me who has to maintain an extremely low sodium diet. To use it for soup, even for 1 person, you'd need a whole cube. Adding in the natural sodium in vegetables, that would be soup I would not be able to eat. I contacted the company (maplegrovefoods.com) 3 times to ask why the discrepancy in sodium content between the label on the product and the website, and never talked to anyone that could answer any questions. The second person I talked to told me to take it up with Amazon. Now that's BAD business!"
1.0,Poor Packaging,"Order was for six cans, due to the fact that this brand was no longer carried by our local supermarkets. While the goods were received on a timely basis, poor packaging resulted in all six cans being severely dented when received. Four of the six were discarded due to food safety concerns.  Overall, ir is unlikely that I will ever purchase canned goods, or any product requiring prtective packaging from this site again."
5.0,"Tastes like real chicken gravy, fantastic meat substitute","My husband is a vegetarian who has not eaten meat since he was 12 years old.  He does not even remember what meat tastes like.  It is very difficult for the two of us to find a meat substitute that I will enjoy as well, and even harder to find one that I am willing to use instead of the real thing.  Hain Gravy Mix is one of those rare gems that I am happy to use.  The flavor is authentic and great, and it is SOOO quick and easy to make.  Plus, it's a lot healthier (which is worthwhile when you don't have to trade in flavor).  This one gets an enthusiastic 5/5 stars.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,Happy to find them.,I was having a hard time finding these hot dog treats since Walmart keeps discontinuing to carry items my dogs love. My dogs love these things so were happy to have found them on Amazon.
5.0,Best Ever brownies!,"These are unbelievably good!  I am a baker myself and my brownies are good too, but these have a cocoa taste that I don't know how to replicate.  They are rich and served with a scoop of ice cream should satisfy even the most discerning dessert buff.  Thanks Geoff & Drew!"
5.0,bought it for the packaging - use it b/c it works,"I'll admit it, I initially bought these because of the packaging. The design indicated to me that the makers believe they have a product that is truly different, and I think they're correct. I've tried all of them and ordered more. They all do what they say they do. Here's how I use them. Have a Sonic with lunch, it puts the kibosh on the afternoon crash, which I experience as not being able to focus on work. It's not buzzy -- it's a lot like 5 Hour Energy only tastes like Knee-Hi Strawberry soda. Bliss is awesome. I don't even know how to describe it. I've kept these at work, and when things get crazy and I want some ""me time"" I have one on ice. It's wonderful. You just have to try it. Trim is nice to have at dinner if you're a night-time snacker. Sleep is the one I've got the least use for, but have tried it after staying up too late on task. You know how sometimes you get wound up and find it difficult to sleep when you've been working, reading or just puttering around the house? It totally takes the edge off that. I'm far from being an insomniac, so ymmv.  I do have to get something cleared up -- on my second purchase they sent no Trim and twice as much Sonic. Not cool, Neuro. Hopefully we'll get this taken care of."
5.0,FANTASTIC,"The bottle promises improved strength in 7 days, but my hair felt infinitely better after just a single use. I have a great deal of very long, very fine, very straight hair, and generally I find that conditioners leave my hair feeling not conditioned enough (and sadly dry and static-y, particularly since I moved to the desert) or far too weighed down by product. This conditioner did neither -- it just left my hair feeling thick and shiny and smooth. I haven't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces split ends -- I brush carefully, so I'm not particularly prone to them anyway -- but it's worth the price even if that particular claim is bunk, because my hair has never in my life felt this healthy before."
5.0,"Tastes good, like a pasta should","My sister is allergic to gluten, so it was nice to be able to make a tasty pasta that didn't feel like cardboard in your mouth. One package makes a good amount for a main meal for two, or for a side dish for 3-4. Good stuff!"
1.0,Bitter!,"I ordered these supposedly sweet peas from this seller and couldn't wait to try them.  They sprouted well, but were bitter.  I originally thought I had done something wrong in the sprouting process, but I decided to try an unsprouted dry seed.  I rinsed it and it was bitter before I even started the sprouting process.  I contacted the seller directly to let them know they may have a bad batch.  The seller told me that some people rave about the sweetness of her peas and some say they are bitter.  I've gardened for years and the only time peas are bitter are when they are overripe.  The seller should be tasting and testing the batch before buying it.  She did not apologize at all.  The garbanzo bean sprouts I bought tasted fine so I think it's this batch of peas.  I wanted to get a replacement, but was afraid it would be bitter as well.  The seller was nice enough to check the lot number for me and it was the same so I decided to go for a refund instead which I needed to do through Amazon."
5.0,Wasabi+Soy=AWESOME,"The title says it all.  The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
5.0,My fave coffee for the Keurig Vue,"If you like strong, dark coffee, the Barista Italian roast for the Vue cup is excellent. I make it on the STRONG setting for 8oz and it's perfect. In fact, it's better than what I make in my regular pot unless I have very fresh coffee just ground from beans. The color is a rich, blackish brown, the roast is dark but not burnt-tasting and of all the coffees for the Vue I've tried, this one wins hands-down. I have the same blend in K-cups (for the office, where the K version sits) and they are not as good, for some reason. The Vue is not the most economical way to make coffee (that would probably be a plastic Melitta filter with a paper cone and a mug or a French Press) but the Keurig is fast and convenient. And I get the coffee the strength and temperature just the way I like it."
1.0,Look inside... These rolls are hollow!!,"When you pick these retriever rolls up, and hold them in your hand, they feel very lightweight. I didn't think much about it until today, when I decided to saw one in half so that my dog could have a quick chewy treat. The outside the roll looked perfect -- they appear to be densely rolled rawhides. But, upon looking inside the roll I discovered that THE ROLL WAS A HOLLOW TUBE!  These rolls are very deceptive. You could give hundreds of these to your dogs and not realize that there is very little rawhide in them.  Whoever rolled the hides simply rolled an external hide once around two thin strips of rawhides into the end of the rolls to make them look like a long length of hide had been rolled up tight (imagine a thin coil of rawhide neatly stuffed into each end of the roll). To make matters worse, there seems to be some kind of spray foam used as an adhesive to keep it all together.  Do yourself a favor and find a high quality US rawhide company that ships to your local pet store."
1.0,grimy and dirty figlets,These Blue Ribbon Orchard Figlets are packed more dirty than anything I've ever bought. I am now opening up the 8oz. bags and spraying them down after soaking them to remove the grime and dirt.
1.0,These are the small gumballs ...,"Be aware these gumballs are the small ones. Half of the machines Amazon has matched to them are for the large gumballs. 'TheNewMall' that sells these is aware of this fact, but will not issue a return once you order them. Until Amazon fixes the problem and finds a more honest vendor, be aware of what your getting. At the current price, even if your looking for the small ones, your not getting much for your money."
5.0,These are the bomb!,"I used to go camping up near Traverse City and every year bought these cherries. Haven't been able to go in a few years, so I was so happy to get them this way! This is even cheaper than in their retail store up there and they are just as wonderful! Love to eat them out of the bag or in my oatmeal!"
1.0,No Cats Please!,"The Turkey Sticks and Pepperoni , and the Hummis are wonderful. However, I feed stray cats every morning at the high school where I teach and they walked, no ran, away from the Salmon and Tuna. This was after I tried each one and decided I could not consume either. The eleven feral cats confirmed the shock to my taste buds."
1.0,Skip it!,"Don't waste your money and order directly from Nespresso!  Any Nespresso capsules sold on amazon (by various vendors) are marked WAY up, some by as much as 50%!  Don't be fooled."
1.0,TERRIBLE RED LICORICE!!!,"THOUGHT THESE RED LICORICE DOGS MIGHT BE GOOD SINCE THEY ARE A GOOD BRAND NAME,BUT ALAS THEY ARE LACKING IN ANY KIND OF FLAVOR.NO LICORICE FLAVOR AND NO CHERRY OR STRAWBERRY FLAVOR,JUST GUMMY DOG SHAPED CANDY WITH NO IDENTIFIABLE FLAVOR TO SPEAK OF.YOU WOULD DO JUST AS WELL BUYING SOME OF THAT ""GOD AWFUL"" RED COLORED TWIZZELERS AT THE GROCERY STORE.I WAS IN SEARCH OF SOME REALLY GOOD CHERRY LICORICE AND THIS PRODUCT WAS A REAL DISSAPPOINTMENT.THIS COMPANYS BLACK LICORICE HOWEVER ""IS"" VERY GOOD."
1.0,Not real Olive Oil,"Just (probably) corn oil flavored like it.  I opened a *new* bottle and it was rancid, Olive Oil does not go rancid (full of anti-oxidants) unless it's older than Greece."
5.0,Organic burger,We want to eat only organic food. This product helps us with our hamburger cravings. The subscribe and save helps us never run out.
1.0,Disappointed,"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it."
1.0,OLD COFFEE!,"This coffee was 3 months old when I got it. Buying this coffee through Amazon is a mistake, not fresh! Subcribe and Save is a worse mistake. Great price for old, dried-up coffee beans is bad news. Do yourself a favor only buy this coffee directly from Coffee Bean Direct where it is freshly made!"
5.0,wonderful!,"Very chocolately, raspberry taste unlike some of the Van Houette k-cups (Spicy Mayan Chocolate, for example, which (to me) has little or no flavor and smells like wet, sweaty socks.)  Well, the chocolate raspberry truffle definitely does have plenty of flavor and smells as amazing as it tastes. Definitely worth the purchase! Also, the 24-count boxes are great for host/hostess/party gifts and much better than the ubiquitous bottle of wine that everyone brings, assuming, of course, that your host has a Keurig coffee machine.  Great product!"
5.0,Good stuff in this bottle!!,"I usually buy this product at Sams Club, but have not found it on the shelf for months.  I use it as a supplement to aid in cholesterol control. My check-ups and low fat diet are my main plan of attack, but pomegranate has been added for more control.."
5.0,Good Health Kettle Chip with Sea Salt,"The sea salt chips are simply outstanding, they have a fresh slighly salty taste and are crisp. Good Health chips have ZERO trans fat. Excellent buy!"
5.0,Fantastic Taste!,"Not only is the taste great, you can make great-tasting iced tea in less than 5 minutes!  Highly recommend!"
1.0,HFCS is a gift of death to boost corporate profits,"High Fructose Corn Syrup, just like GMO crap, is not food; it's toxic, so avoid. Tasty is not healthy, as fast food and fat people obviously testify. This is made for marketing not people. Let's see them drink 6 per day for one year and check their pulses."
5.0,Too Delicious.,"I really wanted to try these. I love pomegranate and it is truly a very difficult flavor to nail. And I must admit that these do not exactly do the flavor justice. But what it does do right is that it has a linger flavor of pomegranate that seems very natural. Newman's licorice does use concentrated pomegranate juice, and once you get it going, the flavor sneaks up ... and you suddenly find yourself wanting more, almost needing it. It is deceptively refreshing."
5.0,as a stocking stuffer,"This is really a great idea - a package of 10 dried pineapple tidbits. You could use it for lunches or carry it with you when you need a little pick me up. I bought this to use as a stocking stuffer for my hubby's stocking and he loved it. It's also much cheaper and tastier than what is generally available in the grocery stores, Try it, you'll like it"
1.0,Yuck,"I read all the reviews on this product and decided to try it. All I can say is Yuck. The three containers that arrive are really small. Which would be ok if this actually tasted like movie butter. It melts, looks and tastes like oil. I love movie popcorn. I even go to the movie theaters sometimes just to get the popcorn, and take it home :) Don't waste your hard earned dollars. Not sure what other people are tasting but you might as well just pour wesson over your popcorn."
5.0,Delicious!,"Well i was a little hesitant due to the price, and because i wasn't sure if i wanted that many bottles in one go. Shouldn't have worried though, as the taste makes the price worthwhile, and the amount is convenient since i keep drinking it non-stop.  Although it says it's ok to leave the bottles out of the refrigerator if not opened, i stored mine in the fridge. Since it taste exactly the same way the first bottle i tried when i received them, i'm thinking it's better this way.  This may be a little TMI, but they might be people like me who have the same trouble, so i'll say it. If you have trouble with constipation or hemorrhoids, this is perfect way to regulate yourself and make it easier. Sure you could stuff yourself with a bunch of fiber pills everyday, and probably accomplish the same results, but if you hate taking pills this work as a natural alternative."
5.0,Fantastic,These are fantastic! I've gone through about 20 bags in the last couple months.  Try putting out a bowl of these rather than pretzels or chips.  They've got a hint of saltiness to them so they go great with beer.  The bulk box of 15 bags is also the most economical purchase I've found.
1.0,Cotton Candy Yuck!,"If you like Starbucks Chai tea stay away from this. It is too sweet and not a good sweet. A 4 year old from far away from me said ""I smell Cotton Candy"" when I was drinking it. It is just overpowering sweet without the pleasure of the spice taste. So then I tried it without the Latte part and the spices were not pleasing -they had a strange taste to them. My search for at home chai continues. We will not be buying this again. On a side note: I do like Stash Chai Black tea bags they are different than the Starbucks, but very pleasing."
1.0,Not as described,"The description refers to the item shown in picture, the Colavita EVO in the green tin. This is the same olive oil sold in many shops and supermarkets (and in Italy, by the way) and made exclusively of Italian olives. However I've been shipped a different item, a blend of Italian, Greek, and Spanish olives, sold in a white tin. Same brand but not the item described, and that I intended to buy."
5.0,Cannellina Beans,These are the best of all white beans.  If you soak them overnight and then cook them on medium heat the hulls will not crack.  It only takes about 40 minutes to cook these beans.
1.0,pet unable to chew,These munchy sticks were so hard that my dog could not even chew on them.  I gave them to some friends that have a much larger dog and he could not chew them.  We soaked them in water and still could not get them anywhere near soft or munchy.  Sorry for the poor review.
5.0,yumm!,"I was in Virginia beach, an went to 7 eleven an they sell these for 99 cent. Total I got 25 of them an I can't wait to get more in a few more days when i go back to VA.  I live in GA where they don't have 7 eleven :("
5.0,Love the CINNAMON Mentos,"I have been purchasing the cinnamon Mentos from my local stores, but they no longer handle the product, plus it cost over a $1 a roll when I could find them.  I was very happy to find them because cinnamon is my favorite and the grandchildren love them too."
5.0,Great transaction! Great Coffee!,I love the coffee and I love the transaction. Fast and easy. Thanks very much!!
1.0,Pretzels?  I don't think so...,"These should not be labeled ""pretzels"". More like compressed sawdust. Inedible in my opinion.  And I'm stuck with 12 bags of them.  Yuk!"
5.0,great product,"bit expensive but worth it first tried it in New Zeeland and glad it is available, because we could not bring it through customs"
5.0,Great taste,"I loved this bread.  Very tasty with a good texture and taste.  I tried making something similar from scratch and it didn't turn out anything like this bread.  Slices great warm or cold.  I bake for my boss and her family and they all voted a resounding ""Yes, we like this"" when I brought her in a loaf.  Freezes well and toasts up great either plain or with butter or cream cheese.  My boss ate hers with spaghetti after lightly toasting.  She said it was outstanding and wanted more (am I surprised, no).  Would highly recommend if you want a good Italian style bread.  I made mine in my horizonetal Wolfgang Puck breadmaker and used a crisp or dark crust setting.  I tried all other settings, light and medium and the bread came out great with a little different texture but still great nonetheless."
5.0,Awesome!,"Okay, so I've been vegan for 9 years. This means I haven't tasted actual franks in that long. These franks tasted very familiar though. After reading the last review, I realize why. He was exactly right! It has a vienna sausage taste. Though it doesn't have that exact flavor, which is great. I always attributed the part of the flavor it doesn't have with spoiling meat anyway. So this is perfect for me. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  These franks are nice and plump. I boiled them, though I thought it would mess up the flavor. But they were perfect after all. I can't wait to try the burgers!"
1.0,Stale Granola Bars,"The Granola bars, with about a month left before being out of date, were stale, petrified and inedible.  I returned the product to the original seller.  Amazon charged double what the original merchant charged for the product. All in all, a very disappointing experience.  I have bought from Amazon many times in the past and was always pleased with the merchandise.  This was the first ""FAIL"" for me."
1.0,They tried to cover the item expiration with a sticker!,"I love this product, but BEWARE, Amazon has covered an expired expiration date with a sticker! Shame on you Amazon!"
5.0,Great coffee,Love this coffee.  Strong but not too strong...great flavor. I always keep it on hand.
5.0,The Little One Loves This,Our 6 month old absolutely loves this multi-grain cereal. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
1.0,Not Mrs. Weiss noodles,False advertising not Mrs Weiss noodles  Get the real ones.  Seller needs to make this right or leave amazon.
5.0,Perfect Training Treat,"A trainer suggested these treats over a year ago and once I bought them I never when back to hotdogs.  They are really easy to use and my dogs love them.  When I trained our smaller dog, they were easy to break apart.  Ever since I used them the first time I became a loyal Zuke's convert!"
1.0,Salty Enough to give you Hypertension,"These are not at all spicy, so little wasabi taste it should be named ""MSG peas"". If you hate the spicy taste of wasabi then this is the thing for you(but then why are you ordering 'wasabi peas' in the first place!?)They are so salty I stopped after a few and I usually finishes a whole can in one sitting. And they are hard so watch out for your teeth. Overall, disappointed."
1.0,"Nice price...but sadly, not potent ...:(","I purchased these mushrooms after taking cordyceps for about a year.  Previously, I was supplied by my father who always ordered them online from Mushroom Harvest.  I figured that this price was better so I decided to buy my own.  I should also state that I take them for 2 specific reasons.... 1. They eliminate my allergies and 2.  They significantly  help my endurance.  I gave half of the NEW cordyceps to my father and kept the other half for myself.  At first, I thought that perhaps it was me because I did not feel any effects at all.  I took them exactly as I had in the past for 2 weeks and sadly, my allergies resurfaced which prompted me to be extremely tired.  I had some of my OLD Mushroom Harvest cordycep supply from my dad so I took a teaspoon.  Within that day, my allergies cleared which indirectly effected my energy level.  I was back to running/gym and my regular work routine at my usual pace.  I did not want to believe that these mushrooms were not potent so I would still take the NEW ones periodically for a week at a time.  At one point, I even tried increasing the dosage..... but still rendered the same disappointing results.    Months later, I mentioned the differences in mushrooms to my father.  He said that he noticed the same effects or lack there of but did not tell me to avoid offending me since I bought/gave them to him. :(  He had already ordered himself more cordyceps from Mushroom Harvest.  I had to do the same thing which bothered me because somehow no matter how old I get, he is always RIGHT!!!!!!!    I really wanted these cordyceps to be effective and am sadly disappointed that they were kind of a waste............ On a positive note, the Kismet Kreations Cordyceps came in a timely fashion and had a nice hand written thank you on the invoice!!!! :)  P.S. No, I am definitely not an endorser for Mushroom Harvest.... If anyone can tell me where to get equally potent but less expensive Cordyceps, please let me know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)"
5.0,great variety,"Awesome variety of flavors, coffee, decaf, tea, hot chocolate. My work also orders this variety pack pretty frequently, we love it. Great product."
5.0,Best brand so far,"The Feline Organizational Committee in my house has informed its employee that this is an acceptable product. They previously complained about everything except Natural Value with Albacore and this one. You do not want to be in this house when they are complaining. As for my research, so far as I know there are no additives. This company does not fool around with the product or try to make it pretty for me or stretch it with inedible filler. They provide real fish and real crab (in a small amount of clear fishy jelly). That's fine with me. I don't want additives that make things colorful and eventually kill my cats. I don't want to look at it, they don't see in color, and all they want to do is smell it and eat it. And when they are happy, I am sooo relieved. Keep up the good work!"
5.0,FOLGERS COFFEE,I ORDERED THIS FOR A FRIEND. THEY USE THIS BRAND. SO I GOT HER SOME AN THEY LOVE IT. SHIPPING WAS FAST. PAID LESS FOR THIS ORDER FOR SHIPPING THAN I EXPECTED AND MADE IT A GOOD PURCHASE WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE PRICE OF BUYING AT WALMART AND HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO SHIP FROM HERE. THEY WERE DELIGHTED. WAS A GREAT GIFT FOR THEM
5.0,2 boys under 10 love it,My review of the literature suggested xylitol gum to reduce or prevent ear infections. My son had several ear infections after bouts with allergies and one dose of penicillin for the infection nearly landed him in the hospital due to a severe allergic reaction.  My choice is to be proactive and reduce the bacteria in the mouth that migrates and causes ear infections. The gum tastes great and he hasn't had an ear infection since. WE bought him the toothpaste too and he brushes all the time with it.
5.0,My kids loves it!!,This bag take care of my family for 2 weeks without food.  I'm ordering 2 bags per month.  Con: Should have big of 10 lbs.
5.0,best ice cream ever,"This cocoa is amazing with its wonderfully strong, sinfully good flavor (I never had the old type in the silver can, so I cannot compare them). Unlike others, I did not notice this to be bitter (and I used a lot in my recipe).  When my wife, who *is* Dutch, moved here, she was very disappointed with the cocoa we could find in the stores. I noticed that Ben & Jerry's used alkali-processed cocoa, so I went looking for some and found this, and then made chocolate ice cream with it. Both my Dutch wife and I think it is the best chocolate ice cream ever. My recipe is below.  Also, note that the item selling here is for SIX containers of cocoa (I paid $2.37 for one at Central Market). Some reviewers think that the price is for only one container. If you can't find it elsewhere, this is still cheaper than the real Dutch cocoas.  Dave's Dutch Chocolate Extreme Ice Cream    2 lg eggs  500 ml heavy whipping cream (about 2 cups + 1 tbsp + 2.5 tsp)  250 ml whole milk  (about 1 cup  + 1 tbsp)  150  g sugar  (3/4 cup + 1/2 tbsp)   65  g dutch cocoa  (3/4 cup + 1 tbsp: well-packed)  pinch  salt  whisk eggs a few minutes to fully blend.  then whisk in sugar until well blended.  continue to whisk until smooth while adding in cream, milk, cocoa, and salt.  store in fridge overnight (this helps with the texture).  freeze according to your ice cream maker's instructions."
5.0,Great product,"I have never had sea salt before, but I'll tell you, I'm hooked!  This is an excellent product, and tastes better than iodized salt.  I understand it's supposed to be better for you too.  You won't go wrong with this product."
1.0,not a sweet deal,"Dont buy.  I think i am stuck for usd 25.50 as i just read i cant return it. Daughter in-law said she had to use 6-7 pkts in her coffee and it still wasnt sweet.  Granddaughter hated it -didnt taste good/sweet. No wonder they package 400 - it is like ""gotcha"".  I wont buy an item of this quantity again, unless i have tried first.  good luck."
5.0,clean teeth for my baby,My dog loves these chews. He asks for them every night. Much cheaper to buy them here than try to find them in stores.
5.0,Very Good Quality! Excellent Taste & Purely Delightful.,"This Organic Ginger powder is a excellent product for a good price & you just can't beat what you get for the money & the quality of the powder is unparalleled. I love this stuff. It last forever. I kept one pound bag out & the other 1 pound bag I put in my chest freezer. I will definitely be purchasing more of this wonderful A grade organic ground ginger. I put a tablespoon of it in my tea, I put a tablespoon of it in a glass of water with 1 tablespoon of organic ground wheat grass powder with real lemon & 1 heaping tablespoon of  Honey Gardens Raw Honey, 2-Pound Glass Bottle  or the other honey I use is  YS Royal Jelly/Honey Bee - Raw Honey, 22 oz gel . I also put a Tablespoon of it sometimes in my green smoothies sometimes. Simply Wonderful & I am truly enjoying the taste of this yummy Ginger."
1.0,Are you serious?,At this price and you expect to sell these?... You have to be kidding!  This has got to be a joke?
1.0,Horrible flavor!!!,"I brought this item to work for lunch today... let's just say I'm eating an apple & some trail mix I had in my desk. The flavor & smell of the sauce was just so unappetizing. The ONLY thing this product has going for it is a little bit of spice. Otherwise, the flavor is terrible. Cheap-o ramen noodles have better flavor. I'm highly disappointed considering what I paid for this (at the grocery store)."
5.0,Tasty and Crunchy,"I tried two varieties, the Vanilla Blueberry Clusters and the Cinnamon Oat Clusters, both with Flax Seeds.  The package, which weighs 11 oz., advises that you can eat the product as a snack on the go, sprinkled over yogurt, or in a bowl with milk.  The serving size is one third of a cup.  The vanilla blueberry variety contains 120 calories, and the cinnamon variety has 130 calories, with 30 calories coming from fat.  The package also advertises that there are 5 grams of fiber, and 750mg. Omega-3 in each serving.  The clusters contain 100 per cent whole grains, including amaranth, quinoa, oats, millet and buckwheat.  The product is low glycemic, without refined sugars, non GMO, and contains no saturated fat, or trans fat, is cholesterol free and very low sodium.  The clusters are gluten free.  The back of the package notes that the product contains soy, and is made in a facility that uses peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame seeds.  The clusters vary in size from one grain of one of the ingredients to clumps three quarters of an inch in diameter..  They aren't hard to break apart, so this isn't really a problem, except maybe if you are trying to sprinkle them from the package onto yogurt.  You might want to pre-crumble the larger pieces before trying this.  Eating them on yogurt was my preferred use for the vanilla blueberry clusters.  There was something about the flavor of this variety that I didn't immediately like, eaten out of hand.  I can't explain what it was, maybe too sweet?  I have to say, though, that although this was my initial reaction, the flavor sort of grew on me later.  Mixing the clusters in blueberry or other fruit-flavored yogurt masked whatever it was I didn't like and added a nice crunch.  Eating the clusters over yogurt wasn't my favorite use of the cinnamon flavor.  This is just personal preference, because I don't want a cinnamon flavor added to my fruit-flavored yogurt.  If you think you would like this flavor combination, or if you eat vanilla or plain yogurt, then eating these with yogurt might work for you.  Like the vanilla variety, these would add a nice crunch to balance the smoothness of the yogurt.  I liked eating the cinnamon clusters out of hand more so than the vanilla blueberry flavor.  Again, personal preference.  I  sprinkled both varieties (separately) over Special K cereal in a bowl with milk.  They added flavor,  but at 130 calories per one-third cup serving for cinnamon, and 120 calories per one-third cup for the vanilla, it would be easy to go overboard on calories if you ate these alone for breakfast.  All in all, I liked this product.  It was tasty and crunchy.  Although maintaining a ""healthy weight"" is mentioned on the package, they are not especially low calorie, so portion size has to be watched.  If I see them in the grocery store, I will very likely buy them."
5.0,Amazon's Healthy Cereal,"We love this healthy, wheat-free, tasty cereal and can no longer buy it at our local HEB, but it is readily available from Amazon."
1.0,Does not taste like chocolate,"Thought these would be like a brownie with crunchy nuts but I was wrong! These don't taste like chocolate but like bitter cocoa powder instead. Mine had tiny pieces of nuts unlike their other bars that have bigger nut pieces. My husbands had medium nut pieces. We both are vegan and consume only organic foods so we know what to ""expect"" but these are awful. They're not even a little bit good, just bad! The peanut butter chocolate chip by this brand is yummy, especially if it's been sitting in a hot car or out in the sun for a bit :)"
1.0,Nothing like mallowmars,"I bought these cookies because Mallowmars were out of stock everywhere, and I thought these would be similar. Other than the look, they are nothing alike. These Whippet Cookies are horrible. They don't even come close to a Mallowmar. They leave you with with a bad plastic taste in your mouth. Since I can't return them, they will be going in the garbage. I would give them away, but I would never subject another person to such a terrible cookie!"
1.0,Ewwww....,"Well seems like people either love or hate the seasoning used on these almonds. Count me among the latter camp, I am not against seasoning on nuts in general but the flavor used on these is disgusting in my opinion. To me it almost tastes like chicken flavor, as though they were roasted in poultry seasoning. I have a whole can to eat up and I found rinsing and then drying them does help somewhat in getting the flavor off but I will not be purchasing again!"
5.0,I believe in a supreme bean,"If you have seen Monty Python's ""Party Political Broadcast"", or marveled at Ann-Margret swimming in baked beans in the Rock Opera ""Tommy"", then you will have some idea of the importance of the baked bean in popular British culture.  It has long been a staple throughout the British Isles.  A ""Full British (or Irish) Breakfast"" has to include them, and beans on toast are a ubiquitous snack.  There are many species of baked bean in tomato sauce but the undisputed supreme bean is the Heinz, as manufactured in the UK.  Here in the US, we have plenty of canned ""Pork and Beans"", but they are different.  They have pork fat added, for flavor, and are heavily sweetened, often with high-fructose corn syrup and/or molasses.  These Heinz beans do have some sugar but they do not have that distinctly sweet taste that their American cousins have.  Also, they are free of artificial additives.  And they certainly have no pork fat.  They are thus a healthier choice.  If you are used to the pork and excessive sweeteners, then these beans may taste somewhat bland at first but, if you persist, you will soon come to prefer the cleaner, lighter taste and will not want to go back.  As they are imported from the UK, they tend to be more expensive than the native US canned beans.  In fact, some specialist stores stock them here, sometimes at prices slightly lower than Amazon is offering, although Super Saver Shipping and Subscribe & Save make them very competitive, and of course you have the convenience of home delivery.  A bigger problem is packaging.  At the time of writing, Amazon has still not quite mastered the art of shipping canned goods.  They are packed too loosely and tend to knock together.  As a result, 3 of the 12 cans in my consignment had dents in them.  Small dents, to be sure, but I know that some people are reluctant to eat food from even slightly dented cans.  Hopefully, Amazon will solve this problem soon."
5.0,Best internet purchase yet,"If you are looking for a tasty snack or a quick breakfast at work, these are great. I have an ongoing shipment setup to send these to where I work, and as a result I haven't missed breakfast in weeks."
1.0,Not like when I was a kid...,"I had all these nostalgic, wonderful memories from my childhood about these bears.  So sweet, delicious and comforting.  The perfect little treat.  Brother was I disappointed.  The bears were old, stale and disgusting.  I swear I remember them being super flavorful.  I feel like these had been sitting on the shelf since the mid 80's.  Needless to say the Black Forest are always fresh and I will be getting them next time fo-shizzle!"
5.0,great flavor... whole tub gone in less than 9 hours!!!!!,"My boss brought these in to her office to try them out. They lasted about two days... A week later, she brought in another 44oz. tub. When our whole staff of 10 learner about them, nothing was left but the crumbs at the bottom of the plastic tub!!!!! Too good to NOT finish. Best work snack ever!!!!!!"
5.0,Yam Good dog treats,My dogs LOVE these treats and it takes them a little time to chew them up. ...and they don't make my hands too yucky like some other treats on the market. These are MY favorite treats for my dogs.
5.0,Keurig K-Cup Home Brewer,"Great product that brews a great cup of coffee fast and removable water resevoir is the way to go no more messy water refills with a pitcher or coffee pot.  Looks great with any kitchen decor and saves you money, with so many flavors now available in K cups you cannot go wrong.  Only downfall is that the pump is louder than I would have liked but for the savings over store bought coffee or wasting half a pot in a conventional brewer I can live with it."
1.0,Taste's nothing like White Hot Chocolate,"I am a fan of White Hot Chocolate, and this doesn't even come remotely close to the flavor. It is similar to 1% milk with some sugar added to it. My son wouldn't even touch the stuff, said it was horrible. I tried adding it to a cup of regular coffee, and it ruined a good cup of coffee. Those who gave this 5 starts obviously have no clue what good White Hot Chocolate tastes like! Gross, don't waste your money."
1.0,Way too Sour!!,"I normally love Plum products, and when I ordered Pumpkin and Banana, I thought it would be a perfect mix for my 18 month old.  He took one bite, and spit it out.  Confused, I tasted it, and was shocked by how sour it was! After reading the ingredients, I saw they put lemon juice in the mix.  I now have 23 bags of food my children refuse to eat.  Very disappointed!!"
5.0,Love this stuff,"Not for sale where I live, I order it by the case.  Good stuff."
5.0,My dog loves it and i love it because it helped stabilize his stomach.,"So my dog (Male Boxer) has a really weak stomach due to an infection he has had as a puppy (I assume) This food has helped stabilize his stomach within 4 days of using it. Solid dog poops all the way :) Even though pricey i only use about a cup and a half of this dog food and he is full. He always leaves about half a cup when i feed him the recommended dosage of two cups. With cheaper foods it was totally different, i'd have to use up to 4.5 cups.  This food is awesome!"
5.0,Great Oatmeal,"This stuff is great. My family can not tell the difference between this, McCainns and Honeyville Farms. All three taste great. 10 pounds will fill a coffee can sized container and a gallon bag.  Bring 3.5 cups water plus pinch of salt in pan to rolling boil. Before you go to bed, add 1 cups oat groats plus two rounded tablespoons pecan meal to the water. Stir. Turn off the burner / remove from heat when it almost foams to the edge. Cover and lit sit on the stove overnight. In the morning, heat individual bowls in the microwave. I add a bit of milk and one tablespoon brown sugar. We prefer our oatmeal thicker than standard porridge and this is more than enough for 4. The thickest I have made it is 3.5 cups water to 1.25 cups oat groats.  The pecan meal adds nutty flavor. You can make meal using your blender to process nuts."
5.0,PRO - PROBIOTIC SWEETENER,"Nevella is an outstanding product. This is a Probiotic product that actually works to assure a balanced digestive system and regularity. I've been using Nevella for about six months and am amazed. I no longer take an individual probiotic in pill form. My local grocery store only carried it for a short time but as always, I can count on Amazon to deliver."
1.0,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this product.  It is NOT the product advertised!  I used to be a regular buyer of the Nong Shim Hot and Spicy Picante Bowl Noodles.  It appears that Nong Shim has made a change to their product offering and I have not been able to buy this product anywhere.  A while ago, I made my normal order for the product and received a case of Hot and Spicy *beef* noodles.  This is a very different product than what is advertised on this page.  The new product has a flavor that is bland as compared to the original and in particular is much less spicy.  In thinking that it was my error in the order, I went back and made sure to order from this link...and I still received the beef flavor.  At that point, I contacted Amazon about the error.  They refunded the second order and said that they would correct the page so that it has the correct info.  Now, a few weeks later, it appears that they still have not corrected the product information.  Please do not order this product from this link.  If you want to try the new beef flavor, search for Nong Shim spicy beef and you will get a page for that product.  But if you order from here expecting to get what it shows, you will be disappointed.  Finally, unrelated to my purchase here, I have started to see the new product on store shelves with the word ""beef"" removed from the cardboard outer wrapper.  I purchased one from my local store hoping that it was new packaging for the old product.  Much to my dismay, the inner packaging (ie. the lid on the bowl, which you cannot see before purchasing) still said that it is the beef flavor.  It's too bad that Nong Shim has made this change.  I really enjoyed the old product, but I do not like the new one at all."
5.0,Love it!,"I love this stuff!  I gotten it in a grocery store when traveling and haven't been able to find it since. I'm ordering a pack now for my sister-in-law to try for nausea.  Hopefully it will be as good as I remember, chewy, spicy, and full of ginger!"
5.0,Wonderful choice,"This purchase was a wonderful choice. I was not sure what I would be getting. I made the purchase based on the comments I had read. Pero is a winner in my book. I had drank Postum in the past but it is no longer available. This drink is even better and is smooth and not bitter. You do have to follow the directions on making it, if not it will clump in your cup. I am 100% satisfied."
5.0,Excellent,"I have tried many hot sauces(Frank's, Texas Pete, tabasco, etc) and this one is the best.  Some sauces have heat.  Some have flavor.  This one has both.  It will add a very unique flavor to you food.  You wont be dissapointed."
5.0,Yum!,"Delicious Tea, not too bitter but with a nice strong taste. The foil packets are great, and I use them to keep my desk clean as a spoon rest at work! I underestimated how big a box of 100 tea packets would be, but no worries, I'll get through them all eventually!"
1.0,Didappointed!,"I was disappointed with this product. I was hoping it would be like the ones you have in motels. I have the waffle maker but can not find an easy mix for it. I have to make it from scratch, which is not always convient. This mix tastes more like cornbread than waffles."
1.0,Used once and switched,"I have a new Akita puppy, and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I couldn't get the breeders type of food in my area. After transitioning him to the Canidae, his stools were loose and yellow. I looked on-line, and saw that Canidae switched their formula, and my puppy's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about. I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy, and everything has been coming out fine since."
5.0,Pine Nuts,"We eat a lot of pine nuts.  We use them in our salads, in Basil Pesto, and as a snack.  This was our first experience with Amport Foods Pine nuts.  We were pleased with the quality and taste.  The price was competitive.  We'll buy these again."
5.0,I should have looked more carefully!,"Here is the important information on the product page:  Safety Information Contains soy, peanut, almond, hazelnut, walnut and pecan ingredients.  Ingredients Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Canola Oil, Crisp Rice With Soy Protein (Rice Flour, Soy Protein Concentrate, Sugar, Malt, Salt), Honey, Brown Sugar Syrup, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt, Soy Lecithin, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor, Peanut Flour, Almond Flour, Hazelnut Flour, Walnut Flour, Pecan Flour. --- Although I am allergic to peanuts and almonds, I ordered the delicious crunch granola bars, oats and honey flavor.  When they arrived in their inviting ""100 percent natural, excellent source of whole grain"" I could not wait to crunch down on one of these golden delicacies.  I quickly discovered that for me these bars are real wheezers.  The taste committee living in my house confiscated them.  The report is that they are 100 percent delicious."
5.0,favorite coffee,"As the title says, it's my favorite blend.  I got hooked while living in Hawaii, and can't buy it in my local grocery store just yet.  The price was right, it's the real deal, and it's great coffee.  Not too strong, good flavor, brews up nice in a French press.  If you like super dark coffees, might not be for you."
1.0,bullseyes,I was really disappointed in the quality of these bullseyes.  They were very hard not soft like the others I have gotten.  The ones I got a long time ago were nice and soft.  These were too hard to do anything with. I had to throw them away.
5.0,Great coffee at a great price,Love this coffee I like strong coffe my husband likes weak coffee we get two cups out of one pod
5.0,Love these!,"Nice vegetarian protein, low cal, good taste, quite spicy, but there are other flavors that are tasty as well and not as zesty...I especially like the terryaki and thai peanut flavors."
1.0,Rancid,I received this order in good condition but when I started using it it had a rancid flavor.  I have used other brands that tasted wonderful but not this one.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.
5.0,Kids like it.,"My children love V8 Fusion, especially the strawberry banana flavor.  It's thick and sweet and delicious.  Thanks to creative labeling that deemphasizes the vegetable content, I don't think my kids have noticed there are vegetables in it.  Either they haven't noticed or they just don't care.  I like that they get their servings of fruits and veggies for the day."
1.0,smells like turpentine,"I did not open right away, I had ordered another kind of cereal and started that kind first.  Therefore was not able to return, as I missed the deadline by a couple of days. The cereal smells like turpentine. Will not be ordering this again.  After a while smell comes through and even the box starts to smell like this.  I have asked others about it just to make sure it was as I had perceived it.  No one else had a different opinion.  They too say it stinks. I will feed the grandkids the sugar-laden cereals before this ""healthy"" one."
1.0,Bad Business Practice byPetco and Amazon.com,"I decided to try these because they had a very nice offer for a 25 count. I purchased and paid for the Snozzles and awaited my package to arrive. A few days later, instead of my package arriving I received an email stating this they do not carry the Merrick Snozzles Pork Chew Dog Treat in a 25 pack. Well if you don't carry it then why is it still listed on Amazon.com's website. In my opinion either Petco or Amazon.com should have honored this sale. They did not and shame on them."
5.0,Greenies,"My dog loves greenies, but they are quite expensive. Anytime I can save some money on them, I try. My dog will go to the counter top that has the greenies on them and sit down looking at them. If we don't respond, he will whimper until someone gives in and gives him one. Then he gets excited, jumps around before he grabs it and runs off to eat it in private."
5.0,Great Product,I have used the product for over two years and have found it very beneficial.  I have recommended it to my friends and they are using this product as well.  Keep producing it.
5.0,Pork Chomps are the BEST,"My dog absolutely loves her mini twist pork chomps.  They are the ultimate treat.  I can only find these on Amazon.com or the Pork Chomps website, and with free shipping they are less expensive to purchase on Amazon.com.  I wish these came in a larger quantity bag."
5.0,The Perfect Power Booster,"I often use this KIND Plus Cranberry Almond Bar as lunch.  Why?  Because it is the perfect all-natural combination of proteins and fruit, is gluten free, and delivers 50% of the DV Antioxidants Vitamin A, C and E.  Oh, did I say it's delicious?!  I also carry one bar in my purse for low blood sugar when I'm away from home.  This bar certainly has my vote, and my loyalty! ~ And you can't beat Amazon's subscription prices anywhere -- with free shipping to boot!"
1.0,Sad excuse for K cups,"This is a sad excuse for coffee... I'm like the other reviewer that wondered why it's so light. So we cut it open to see, only a sprinkle of instant grounds on the bottom that disappear when you run it through the Keurig. Yes they're way cheaper but yuck, not worth it."
1.0,So VERY Bad,"If you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee, buy this. Otherwise stick with Starbucks VIA. I use the instant coffee mid-way through my day at work. The Taster's Choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. The Starbucks VIA only needs 1. Spend the extra couple of dollars on the Starbucks if you want good instant coffee."
1.0,Very Weak Blend,I have been used to Dunkin and Starbucks. I decided to try something new and picked this one up at local store after reading rave reviews.  I was thoroughly disappointed in this one. I whole heartedly agree with another comment posted here.  This is worse than office coffee!!!  I found the coffee to be too light compared to Medium Roast of Dunkin and Star Bucks.  The flavour and aroma was akin to hot water run through an already filtered coffee grind.  If you are used to stronger blends and richer flavours then you will not miss this one.  If you are trying to move off coffee or want to go for a light coffee then you might prefer buying this.  I am putting this to compost. This ain't my cup of coffee :(
1.0,Seriously???,"This one has a major problem. It's waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and it's not overly sweet (although it still isn't great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isn't any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! I'll pass, and I'm throwing the rest of the box out."
5.0,No more sour milk!,Works great for the Social Hour at the church.  No more sour milk!  Or forgotten creamer purchase!  Coffee drinkers like it.  And keeps coffee table tidy -- no messy milk spills/drips.  Great for storage -- makes purchase easy to have auto-delivery every 3 months.
1.0,Not good for doggie digestion,Got two bags of these for my dog.  For some reason they make him have to go poo almost instantly.  Tried two different flavors and the both make him sick.  He does not normally have intestinal issues.  I'm going back to regular milk bones or zukes.
1.0,Too Bitter For My Taste,I had high hopes for this drink despite the fact that I prefer unsweetened drinks.  I poured it in the glass and was unhappy with how dark it was.  I took a sip and choked.  This drink is bitter and to me undrinkable.  It was like drinking the bottom of a burned pot of coffee.  I tried adding milk to the cup but it didn't lighten the color at all.  Even with the milk I couldn't drink it and down the drain it went.  Awful!
1.0,Stale and disgusting!,"This product was quite disgusting and stale!  I'm not exactly sure where this old stock came from, but I was highly disappointed with product.  Legitimate Trident gum has an expiration date printed on the product, bright/colorful packaging and tastes fresh.  The product I received was none of the aforementioned and quite unpleasing to the palate!  Never again....I have learned my lesson."
5.0,YUM,"This syrup does not have an after taste like a lot of sugar free syrups do.  It mixes in great and adds mild flavor to any beverage.  I will buy this product again, very pleased!"
1.0,Suggested by Dr. Oz,"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!"
5.0,This is really yummy flavored coffee,"If you don't believe me when I tell you that the Cafe Excellence Jazzy Java decaf whole bean coffee is very tasty, I should tell you that I've ordered 6 pounds of the stuff thus far.  For purposes of introduction, I consider myself to know a fair amount about coffee and roasting.  I own a small batch roaster and often roast my own green beans.  I typically make ""Swiss Method"" coffee in a Jura superautomatic espresso machine.  Typically, I've avoided the flavored coffees.  However, in this case I really enjoy the taste of the various flavors.  According to their website, Jazzy Java is Cafe Excellence's signature coffee.  It is a blend of butter rum, cinnamon and pecan flavors.  I really enjoy it.  The roasting job done on the coffee is worth mentioning as well.  It looks to me like a full city roast, roasted to the 2nd crack.  It's quite full bodied and fresh, but importantly not overroasted.  I generally prefer either decaf or half-caf and you wouldn't know that this is decaf coffee if you hadn't been told that it was.  I've tried Cafe Excellence's non-flavored coffees as well and they are also very good to excellent.  However, this blend is special.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,Good,Delivered as promised. It's coconut milk. I can't say it's any different that other types. I just liked that it was Lite and the price was right :)
1.0,Good idea - Stale Candy,I was looking for that extra something as a joint gift to my grandparents. I got them individual gifts but it did not seem enough so I got this for them as well. When they opened it they seemed excited about the gift and looking forward to seeing the contents. I then asked them later how they liked it and my grandmother said it was no good and the candy was stale. Well that was embarassing. I love buying Christmas presents and finding unique and fun things for my loved ones. I dont get to do a lot for my family normally like most people on a tight budget. I feel let down by the company and sad that the point of the gift wasn't able to be achieved. I would not buy this again and would sadly not be able to recommend it. I think it is a neat idea but the quality of the candy was no good.
1.0,Do not take running,"I would have expected more from Cytomax. I was looking for a drink I could use while running and this failed horribly. Even though this drink is meant to be taken during a workout, there's no way you can take it running. It foams up to the point where you can't drink it. Don't waste your money, stick to water and gel packs."
1.0,Mud?,"This is some of the worst coffee I have ever tasted. The other Caribou styles are tolerable, some even decent, but ""Daybreak"" was just nasty.  I have never written a review for a coffee before, but I felt compelled to share how bad this stuff was in hopes that it will save some one a few bucks and their taste buds."
5.0,A divine experience....,"This is one of the best smoked sea salts I have purchased.  It is absolutely divine on steaks or sprinkled over edamame.  But I have to confess, sometimes I just take off the top every now and then to get a whiff.  Heaven!"
1.0,Robbed by shipping and handling!!!,$27.62 shipping and handling for 30.00 product (24 cans of chili).  I never requested priority shipping. Profit profit profit!!!! 8^<
1.0,Smaller Bar Same Price,"[edit to previous review below] Imagine my surprise when my bars arrived today. Same Shop and Save order, same order history, smaller bars and NO notification to indicate the size of the bar had changed. It is essentially NOT the same product. Shame because the taste is still good but terrible service on the part of the manufacturer not to notify buyers of the change to the product. It dropped from 2.2 oz to 1.8 oz and is now more of a snack than lunch.  *Original Review: Love these bars - satisfies my chocolate craving in a good and healthy way. Like these better than Larabar - no aftertaste and better price."
5.0,Great coffee for a Great price!,I have been drinking Community Coffee for a while and was delighted to find it available on Amazon.  It's hard to find traditional French Roast in Pennsylvania! Ordered two 2-pound bags with their Coffee Club.  Came fast and just as delicious as always!  Thanks again Amazon!
1.0,This is very bad!,"I love SodaStream Zero and I love Pepsi Throwbacks (with pure cane sugar, when you can find them).  So I excited when I heard SodaStream was coming out with this flavor sweetened with cane sugar).  This was the nastiest tasting flavor that I have had.  I hope SodaStream redoes this flavor."
1.0,An appaling product!,"I can't believe that Ms. Deen would sell such a product now!  I bought this on accident, thinking I was getting another seasoning from Ms. Deen's line of seasoning.  I then looked at the label, and noticed that Ms. Deen now promotes cannibalism!  Not only that, but the consumption of a mother and her child!  How could anyone suggest eating a woman and her offspring, I don't know.  Maybe where she lives this is fine, but I will not consume people just for a gourmet treat.  For shame Paula Deen, stop eating a lady and her son!"
1.0,Would not order again,"I ordered this tea based on the glowing reviews, however in my opinion, the quality just is not there.  I usually drink Japanese brand green teas like Yama Moto Yama and Ito En, and sometimes the Chinese-American brand Triple Leaf.  This Stash organic decaf green tea is the worst green tea I have ever had.  It is a very bitter green tea compared to the brands I am used to drinking.  The color of the tea is not as green as the other brands I usually drink, but rather has more of a yellowish tone.  I had wanted to switch to an organic brand of green tea to avoid pesticides, etc. which may be found on the tea leaves of other brands, but this tea was a major disappointment."
5.0,Deeeeeliiiiiicous!,I had these with a slice a quality cheesecake and it was delightful. I highly recommend them! Perfect little jar for a little sweet treat.
1.0,Defect?,"I read the other reviews on this item before I ordered it. Based on those, this coffee sounded wonderful! I ordered it along with a French press so that I could enjoy a cup of coffee before class. When I received both items, I immediately tried to make a cup of this ""amazing"" coffee. What I found was a coffee that had a repulsive after taste. I cannot describe it, but it tastes like chemicals. Not willing to write off the reviews I had read that easily, I thoroughly cleaned the French press -again- and tried the coffee. Same taste. Finally, I used a different coffee in the press and found that it tasted wonderful. My conclusion? Either this coffee is GROSSLY overrated, or I got a bad batch. Either way, I will not be buying again."
5.0,Wow. I didn't gag! A dark chocolate vibe with slight grassy undertones--and impressive nutrients stats,"I ordered this with trepidation. I've never been able to swallow green food mixes, other than Green Magma (which is not ""mixed"", but just barley grass). Wheat grass makes me gag. Literally--cannot swallow it. My body rejects it and I gag and spit it out. So, over the years, trying green foods trying to find something I can swallow has been trying.  Well, there ya go. This one works.  I ordered it on the basis of numerous positive flavor reviews and I liked the list of nutrients/enzymes.  30 calories per serving of 8 grams= 1 g fat, 2 g protein, 4 g carbs (2 g fiber), 65% Vit A, 30% of C and K, 15% of B12 and Riboflavin, 6% of iron and manganese; organic grasses (wheat, barley, alfalfa, spirulina, spinach, broccoli, chlorela); with antioxidant from maca, acai, carrot, rose hips, beet, pineapple, green tea, acerola cherry. Fiber from apple pectin, organic oat powder, organic flax seed powder. Also L acidophilus, peppermint, Siberian eleuthero root, and sea salt.  The flavor is pleasant. It's like the taste of bitterish dark chocolate bars with a grassy undertone that isn't offputting. It's not like it's a chocolate malted or anything, but it works fine for me. I can drink this. I do not gag. Yay.  I will reorder this. I like the healthful profile and the flavor.  UPDATE: Okay, I didn't really expect a noticeable effect from this (I mean, I've had superfoods before and didn't suddenly go change the world or anything), but I have actually noticed an uptick in my energy after adding this to my pre-workout smoothie and my pre-chore protein drink. I've been adding it to BSN sytha-6 chocolate protein mix with an extra teaspoon (heaping) of Raw cacao (organic), and it's a nice flavor combo. I think it would be great with a banana, too, for extra potassium (a chocobanana vibe).  Maybe it's placebo. Who knows? But as I wasn't thinking I'd notice a change, maybe not. But wow, I do feel an energy surge in the afternoon when I usually have a slump and I get through my 55 minute personal training session with more oomph."
1.0,"The listing is one star, not the product","I hope I don't need to tell anybody what baking soda is, or the myriad uses for it. It has been around forever and just always works like it is supposed to. However, what we have here is a listing for a 16oz prduct with a picture of a 1 lb box, that says it is an 8oz product in the description with a shipping weight that verifies that fact. Bad listing, needs to be corrected before you are forced to eat a return shipment. if someone corrects this, please feel free to flush this review."
5.0,Good stuff,This was a very good product! I loved it and would highly recommend it to anyone!! I plan on ordering more when I can.
5.0,Nutmegs were great!,"Finding small bottles of nutmeg meant specialty stores and expense -- a couple of ounces of nutmeg for many dollars.  This Christmas, a nutmeg grinder was a gift given to all the ladies in my family -- one just as my mother hung in her kitchen -- along with fresh nutmeg.  I paid less for this pound of nutmeg, split it between our girls in small jelly jars for a fraction of the small bottle cost.  We've already tasted the added flavor in a variety of dishes. Nothing compares to the fresh grating."
1.0,Nasty and Bitter,"The Habanero chile is one of the hottest chilies known to man. So it comes as no surprise that this sauce is very hot on a drop by drop basis. There is nothing wrong with that! In fact, I prefer a very potent hot sauce. However there is a nasty and bitter aftertaste to this sauce which I don't think anyone would like.  Note: there is no smoke flavor to this sauce despite what another reviewer says. I suspect this reviewer was confused and was thinking of a chipotle sauce (which is made by this manufacturer and many others). A chipotle sauce has a wonderful smoked flavor to it but this sauce does not use that chile and there is not even a hint of a smoked taste to this one.  This sauce is very potent but beyond that considerable heat there is little else other than a nasty and bitter aftertaste.  Not recommended"
5.0,Soy Milk review,"Great to have handy in car while on the go.  Requires no refrigeration.  All flavors are very tasty. ZenSoy, Soy On The Go Chocolate, Organic Soy Milk, 8.25-Ounce Aseptic Packages (Pack of 15)  ZenSoy, Soy On The Go Cappuccino, USDA Certified Organic Soy Milk, 8.25-Ounce Unit (Pack of 15) "
5.0,Yum yum,"These are not soft shortbread cookies but Krunchy with a hint of butter. Great for t2 diabetics but, as you know, anything we eat moderation is key. Although pricey buying a case [12] is a lot cheaper than buying single packs retail at your local grocer."
1.0,watered down hot chocolate,"Received a Keurig brewer for Christmas and also received a pack of this hot ""chocolate"" with it.  We made some after sledding one day for myself, my husband and 2 kids (6 and 10) all thought it was terrible.  We almost returned the Keurig brewer because of it.  I have found that I am enjoying black coffee with my Keurig, but we will never buy any type of hot chocolate k cups again."
5.0,Chocolate Cherries,"If you're a fan of dark chocolate covered cherries you don't need a review. Milk chocolate is easily available during the Holidays, but dark chocolate has to be hunted for. Ordering them thru Amazon is great! I've ordered the last two years.  I noticed a change in the individual wrapping this year. They now have a sticker holding the foil closed. I have no complaints with the candies (they're delicious as always!) or with the shipper. The shipper did an excellent job packing them."
1.0,Practically All Sugar - Yuck!,"I'm the type of person who gets lured in by samples; samples always taste delicious to me (seriously, what's the psychological explanation for this?!). A barista offered a sample of the caramel-flavored coffee and I thought it tasted great. There was a $1-off-Via-plus-free-tall-beverage offer and I gave in. But it wasn't until I looked at the nutritional facts that I discovered there is an overwhelming amount of sugar. And sure enough, when I made my own cup of coffee, it was disgustingly sweet.  I am never going to pay such an exorbitant price for packets of sugar. It doesn't make sense for my wallet or my body. For the same convenience and lower prices, I'd much rather buy Nescafe's Taster's Choice, which I find much more aromatic and rich with coffee flavor."
5.0,Dolce Gusto,"I really enjoy waking up in the morning to a great cup of coffee in just about 30 seconds, great."
1.0,small kibble size --- to high in protein for schnauzer mix,"This food may be very high in quality, but not all dogs can tolerate the high protein content.  Our Schnauzer / Lasa Ahpso mix was drinking water all the time and urinating frequently.  We looked on the bag and noticed the protein level was much higher than the old dog food (which was 21.5% protein, 13% fat) .  To be fair: this is one of the few dog foods that is made in the U.S. and they do have another version (purple bag) with less protein.  We may try that some time."
1.0,Changed the formula-added sugar,"We fed our son only Earth's Best formula from the day he was born. We have used this product for 7 months. My last purchase I looked on the ingredient list and to my surprise the formula had changed. It now has ""organic glucose syrup solids""...added sugar. Why change a great product by adding sugar? I now will be changing to another product and possibly no longer use organic because I feel the added sugar is more harmful. Thank you Earth's Best for 7 months of a good product. Now the doctors thank you for adding to the obesity epidemic and the increase in type 2 diabetics in the US. You have lost a customer."
5.0,Great Value!,"This is a great value!  A jar this large of a single color is very hard to find, and the price is great too."
1.0,Hershey chocolates made with child labor,"Hershey uses cocoa and chocolate that is not Fair Trade certified.  Fair Trade certification means that child and slave labor are not used in the process of growing and producing cocoa.  It also means that cocoa farmers and their workers are paid a fair price.  Learn more at [...] Hershey's chocolate products are less expensive than Fair Trade certified chocolate products, but does the lower consumer price justify children and slaves working to produce Hershey's products?"
5.0,Yum!,I have been dieting and have been trying many different meal replacement bars.  I have to say this is the best one I have tasted!  So many of them are hard but this one is really easy to eat and keeps me full.
5.0,Delicious,"It's hard to imagine a decent meal I prepare these days without Sriracha.  I put it on everything: eggs, sandwiches, Chinese, pizza, burgers, etc.  As someone who's attempting to eat healthier, sometimes the healthy food is a bit bland.  Add a bit of 'Rach, and what was bland instantly becomes flavorful and delicious.  I love Sriracha and can't imagine eating food without it.  And with Amazon's great price and free shipping with Prime, I will never buy it in a grocery store again."
5.0,Super,"I have tried numerous brands of pasta and by far this is the only brand I use. There is no difference from the wheat pasta, the taste is great and you cannot tell the differnce that it is gluten free.  I have celiac for 4 years and I would not eat any other brand. Amazon is the best  price for this product. I am an amazon shopper for many other products and have been very satisfied."
1.0,Roland Farro,"When the product arrived, two of the three bags had holes in them, so much farro had spilled out. We have ordered this product once before without such a problem."
5.0,Hot Drink,"This is the best non-caffinated hot drink I have found!  It dissolves quickly, has a roasted aroma and can even be substituted for coffee in recipes.  Try it at a 1/2 teaspoon as well as a full teaspoon to adjust the amount of flavor you like.  I bought a case - it's the cheapest and I will always have it on hand.  It is an excellent gift as well."
1.0,EHKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK,tastes pretty crappy. it's like raw cookies.  it's not even like a cookie. it's a squishy thing in a cookie shape
1.0,Don't believe the hype...,"Was like the packers in last years playoffs , a total loser.If you want to buy a good fruitcake, find it elsewhere. Wisconson need not be proud of this product."
5.0,Surprisingly impressed!,Wasn't expecting much...I just wanted a reasonably priced mayo that I could buy in bulk that tasted good...  ...and JFG's Real Mayo does just that! It has a better egg flavor than Helmann's and a better price...and good consistency too. It is easy to mix and holds up well without overpowering the other flavors in recipes. I will definitely buy this product from Amazon again!
5.0,great breakfast,Works just like regular pancake mix  - rises and cooks the same and excellent taste. We bought this in bulk and are going through it like crazy. Must be good.
5.0,Lychee Black Tea,I love Lychee tea and have found it difficult to find whole-leaf tea that is of high quality. The China Mist brand that I purchased through Amazon has consistently lived up to my expectations.
5.0,Mary's Gone Crackers,"I love these crackers! No dairy, gluten, or soy. they are the only ones I buy."
1.0,Barely edible salmon spread,This Salmon spread was similar in look and smell to cat food. Too salty. Too dry. Not good.
5.0,Great tea before  and during meals.,"A very unusual and flavorful tea.  It has helped with my weight loss.  It keeps me from snacking in between, and I usually grab for this rather than grabbing for chips or something sweet."
5.0,Healthy and Pops with flavor,"I Love ginger ANYTHING..  This is a non alcoholic brew that offers two strengths of ginger. I prefer the 26 gram bottle. Snappy and bubbly.  It's my ""eye opener"" in the morning . Once you get hooked , you'll miss it when it's gone.  So, I buy 2 cases (48) bottles at a time.  Also is used for goosed up coctails in trendy bars. Try something different and give yourself the benefits of ginger in your life. Mildly spicy with a Jamaican flare. Twist off cap, so bring it with you.  If I have a little stomach queeze, this drink will fix the problem."
1.0,Formula Changed,"A few years back they changed the formula for making these and the result was a more fragile, thinner chip.  They break apart when dipping them into (example, Deans French Onion Dip).  I am not sure why companies just dont leave well enough alone."
1.0,Tough Cardboard Crackers,"It is not my intent to write a overly pessimistic review but, I can't believe these crackers got past the marketing department. They literally taste like cardboard that got wet and was dried. They are tough as leather. I am constantly trying new gluten free crackers but these are inedible. Try the Glutino's except for the whole grain ones, they ruined them with sesame seeds."
5.0,Best Mix Ever,Pamela's Pancake and Baking Mix is the best thing I have found for baking since I was diagnosed with Celiac Sprue. Makes heavenly chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies.  I love their banana bread recipe.  Hadn't had pizza in years but now have it often using their pizza crust recipe.  Check out the recipies on the Pamela's site for great baking! [...]
5.0,Very Happy Purchaser,Great quality.....fast delivery. Will be doing business with them again for sure.
1.0,Yuck!!,"I was anticipating a product that I had when growing up. What I got was sub-par. The first thing i notice was the sticks were not soft but hard as if the product was out of date. Also I don't know if they have changed the formula, but the flavor was gone in a couple of minutes and it was tasteless. Yuck!!"
5.0,Super way to get protein boost,I love the taste of the cocoa in this bar.  Great way to get a protein boost with little calories.  I have a very sensitive stomach stomach and I was completely comfortable eating this.
1.0,Wrong Item Sent,"Frustrating. Order was for 24, 15 oz cans of Goya Gandules. Received order today of 24 14 oz bags of dried gandules."
1.0,My Cats Wouldn't Touch It,"A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it."
1.0,wrongly advertised,"The product shown online is not the product described, so I sent it back for a refund. Bad business and I shall not order from this vendor again."
1.0,yuk!,"After my husband, daughter, and I took our first bite of the Miracle noodles we all said the same thing ""this is disgusting!"". It all went into the garbage! No more miracle noodles for this family!"
1.0,Radical Price Increase,"We can still get this at local supermarkets, Targets, Walgreens, etc for $10 each, so unless you are living in a remote mountain cabin or on a desert island, I would not buy it here. The instant coffee itself is excellent."
5.0,YUM,"This stuff has a TON of salt on it, but what doesn't nowadays? I'd like to try the reduced sodium kind. Regardless, this makes my homemade quickie soups taste fantastic. I just throw in a tablespoon with some water, toss in some veggies, and simmer for 15 minutes. Nice, quick, delicious lunch to take to work. Can't wait to try all the other flavors! I love that it's so beefy tasting...very roast beef and very rich."
5.0,tasty fruit,"My kids love these!  Amazon had a great deal on them with the back to school sale.  I use them as snacks when we are on the go.  We live with a long commute no matter where to go, so nutritous snacks are wonderful.  No complaints about flavor, just gobbled right up.  All flavors are a hit in my house!  Plus, they are currently made in a peanut free facility, great for allergic folks!"
5.0,Great texture,"As another reviewer said, they're sour, but not too sour. The texture isn't hard like other sour candy, ate about 25 of them in a row without it breaking the roof of my mouth or ripping my tongue. The texture is soft, but they don't melt into each other, when you pull them apart, each piece will have their own sour particle in tact. Far better than expected, and it reminds me of a candy I used to get as a kid 15 years ago, I wouldn't be surprised if it was. They liked to charge 5 to 10 cents a straw. Don't hesitate, it's well worth it :O"
5.0,This is a coffee lovers coffee,"When we got this coffee my wife promptly told me she would make if for us the following morning.  She did, and it was one of the best tasting cups of coffee I had ever tasted.  I'm not a coffee addict or a person who would be able to notice much of a difference between a good Starbucks coffee and a cup of Maxwell House, but I certainly noticed how wonderful this coffee was. Great aroma and a full, rich taste!!!  The following morning I was looking forward to another cup of this coffee..... the first thing I notcied was the aroma was different.  Then, as I tasted the coffee I immediately told my wife it didn't taste the same a the previous day.  It was then that she admitted to me that the Marley coffee was too good to waste on my unappreciative taste buds.  She was keeping it for herself.  This coffee is very good.  I'll be buying some more of this just for me and I obviously recommend it."
5.0,Best coconut flakes I know,"If you are looking for flaked dehydrated coconut, look no further. I can't say that I've tried all the brands out there - mainly because I had all but given up on American coconut flakes, that always tastes like cardboard. Similar Brazilian products tend to be less dry, you bite into a flake and taste the coconut natural oils. Well, this is as close to that as I've ever tasted. The flakes might be dry outside, but are still juicy & flavorful. I eat these as a snack and a treat, straight out of the bag!"
5.0,makes great ice tea,We love to brew the tea and add juice or mint over ice.  Very nice alternative to black or green tea.
1.0,Smelled and tested like iron,"I am not sure if it was just my can but the formula had a very strong iron smell and taste. My baby would not eat it, I tasted it and it had an awful taste. Too bad it didn't work for us."
5.0,Fiber one,"This product is great . It does not raise youre blood sugar like regular pancake mix does . It is very , very hard to find in stores . I only found it once , this is why I had to order it on line . It is so worth it . It has a good taste and is healthy for you . Would order it agagin and the free shipping is also a major plus . You can keep it in the freezer to help keep it fresh , if you don't eat it alot or have a small family . Good suff. So is the Fiber One bread and cereal ."
1.0,No,"I thought I would give this one a try since it is cheaper by the ounce and has good reviews.  I suppose it has a better outcome for others.  For me, it gave the feeling of alertness and coherence, but I did feel a strong crash after four hours of consumption.  The other major brands did not do this to me.  Red Rain is a huge disappointment for and I will not be investing in this one again."
1.0,Thieves Ripoff watch out!,"I like amazon, but I don't approve of anyone allowing this to happen. Stop them Amazon, send them down your river!"
1.0,WARNING: HFCS!!,"I was devastated by this product, even angry. Don't they think, the manufacturers of this otherwise great product, that folks who spend their hard-earned money buying blueberries, are trying to eat a natural health enhacing food?  Why contaminate these big, beautiful berries with one of the most horrible sugars ever invented by mankind. Yes, these blueberries are bathed with High Fructuose Corn Syrup. In fact, they have so much of this Genetically Modified sugar that eating a few of them mad me cough uncontrollably! The only way I could eat these blueberries was after washing them for 15 min in running water and this was not enough.  Worse. Where foes it say in their advertisment that this supposedly natural product is contaminated with GM HFCS? I think, we consumers, should be able to look at a lable before we spend our cash. Please do not buy this product if you are looking for a natural diet!  Why not sweeten this product with the new US approved sweetener Stevia?"
5.0,Wagh Bakri tea,"The finest tea I have ever tasted; subtle, not too strong, great for the morning; beats all common brands. Well worth the money.Try also the Wagh Bakri tea loose (great value), and Tea India."
1.0,"Like them separate, not together","I purposely get aloe vera products for first aid and for cosmetics (lotion especially). I drink at least two mugs of green tea a day. I thought that putting these two together would be cool. Not so much. No matter how much you shake it, you're basically drinking a meal, and I just don't like the taste of it. I can't even handle drinking orange juice pulp so these random aloe vera portions floating around gross me out. I'll stick to just green tea."
5.0,Excellent Coffee!,"I had my first cup of Green Mountain Southern Pecan at my daughter's house after a marathon shopping expedition.  The flavor was rich, warm and comforting, and it was love at first taste.  As soon as I got home, I went online and ordered my own Southern Pecan K-Cups from Amazon.  This coffee has definitely become one of my top favorites.  In fact, I'm enjoying a cup of Southern Pecan right now."
1.0,Did not meet our expectations,"My wife and I bought this product with the intentions of using it for the coffee machine we own (Gourmet-Coffee cafe), little did we know that the product (when it arrived) would not fit our machine :-(  , we were so sad to find this out. Adding to the torture-the instructions where in german.  This company needs to put more specifications about its product, so that people like us have less trouble when buying. I would recommend this product but not for the people who have our type of machine. I also forgot to mention that we opened the package. Can we return this product ?-if we can, we will delete this review."
5.0,orchard choice mission figs,"I have been eating these figs for years, about one tray a week. They are a great & very healthy snack."
1.0,Bitter and stale,"I love coffee. I bought Eight O'Clock because I know it is a good brand, %100 Arabica bean. However, THIS coffee is bitter and has a stale taste. I have have better coffee with Folgers and Maxwell house."
5.0,Adds seasoning to otherwise bland food,"The other reviewer has food concerns and gave this product an unfair 1-star.  We have food allergies in our home.  That is why I never buy any food product online, until I read the ingredient list in person, then I research the best online price.  I have bought this product, the cubed version and the low-sodium version over the past 10 years, and have been thrilled with the flavour it adds to soups, rice and pasta dishes.  It's sad that a one-star could deter others from purchasing this product.  If it were so bad, it wouldn't be on the shelves.  I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have any food concerns.  UPDATE - March 2012 - I am happy to see that the other reviewer upgraded their rating to a satisfactory 3-star from the previous 1-star."
5.0,pricey but worth it,my wife makes gourmet food and she loves this chocolate.  best in the world and you can tell in the taste.
1.0,Size Does Matter,"The picture is deceiving and product description is wrong this is not 12 oz, but actually 0.5 oz. The advertised picture shown is a larger size(1 oz), but what was actually sent was much smaller(0.5 oz). We could have gotten 50% more of the same exact product for less. We paid $10.79 for 0.5 oz when we could have paid $9.15 for 1oz. Product itself is great and our cat loves it, we just overpaid and lesson learned."
5.0,Tasty & Not Too Sweet,"I like orange soda but usually cannot drink an entire can or bottle of Sunkist or  Orange Crush Case 4-6pk  because they are so sickly sweet. This has just the right touch of natural sweetness, and the tangerine gives a nice little tang to the orange flavor. Reminds me of the great orange sodas you can get in Europe or specialty shops, like  Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans  or  San Pellegrino Aranciata 6 pack - 6oz bottles .  Dare I say it? Yes. The flavor and size make it a perfect mixer. After my intial sip, I immediately thought it would be great to fill up the rest of the glass with vodka."
5.0,Just what I was looking for,"I don't usually write reviews, but I'm happy to write one about this.  Finally, I've found a lemonade mix made with good old fashioned sugar and NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS!  I think it's a bit sweet for my taste so I like to squeeze a fresh lemon into the pitcher with a little extra water and it's perfect. I had a bunch of kids over yesterday and we went through 6 or 7 packages.  They loved it.  I'm ordering more now and will always have this on hand."
5.0,Accidental happiness,I bought this by accident thinking it was the regular Wheatebix my husband likes. We tried it and were very surprised by it. One of the few high fiber cereals that tastes good.  I have it in my subscribe order now so we stay stocked up. Crushed it also makes a good crumb coating on chicken. Sounds odd but it's really good.
1.0,This product was defective and the company did nothing about it,I emailed the company several times they never emailed back i left about 5 voicemails because they never picked up the phone they left me very unsatisfied The Online Candy Shop ships damaged goods it came on October 8th 2010 so it wasn't hot outside so why was every candy melted and the ones i sampled tasted disgusting i recommend ordering this product from a different store.
5.0,great snack instead of chips,"My kids, 2yrs and 6yrs will eat a whole package of these and enjoy every minute. Some of it is just fun because of the different color and texture. Not as cheap as chips but worth the cost.  Thanks!"
1.0,Standard Shipping,"I recently ordered this with one click. I got my e-mail confirmation and I was shocked to see that the shipping was over $200. When I tried to cancel my order, Amazon would not let me. Why would Amazon even offer a $34 item if shipping was over $200? I will never use order with one click ever again."
5.0,I can't get enough!,"These are the best frozen fruit pops(?) I've ever had. I absolutely love em, and if I could I'd eat several a day I would. Storing is convenient since I don't have to freeze them right away.  It's ridiculous how much I like these. I feel like a kid, but they are seriously that good. You get the fruit flavor which tastes like you're actually eating the fruit, not overly sweet..then you get the slightly creamy yummy flavor and texture of the coconut milk (I normally don't like coconut, but coconut milk is different). Perfect flavor combo, plus the ice that cools you off when it's hot. Perfection!  At 50% natural vitamin C in each of the pineapple wedges, I love that that I can actually benefit from my indulgence. When my kids ask if they can have one, I'm more than happy to say yes because they are not loaded with a bunch of artificial sweeteners, colors, and whatever else you find in regular Popsicles.  FYI: I've also tried the mango, which I like, but the pineapple is my favorite. The mango has a little less vitamin C (40%) than the pineapple, but the mango I can eat more of since too much pineapple irritates my mouth."
5.0,Wisconsinmade is a clear winner,"This shipment arrived carrying the the red hot's, and a couple of jars of pickled eggs which were also Wisconsinmade. The packaging and insert gave the feel of small town artisan pride, which was truly what turned out to be in the box!  These little spicy dandies are not your usual tube meat purchased in the local gas station deli, NO!  They are well made, and have lots more flavor than I have ever experienced in a red hot.  If you are in to the pickled proteins, give the eggs a shot too, they are a wonderful quick and healthy snack."
5.0,The best!,This is the best trail mix I have ever had.  Packed with nuts and other goodies.......oh so good!  I keep it hidden.......I don't want to share!
5.0,Thank you!,Thank you for carrying this product.  I moved from PA to FL and there is no retail store down here that carries this particular flavor of hamburger helper.  So a big huge kudos to Amazon!!!
1.0,too much raspberry flavor,It has too much raspberry flavor.  Tone it down.  I love raspberry chocolate but I would not buy another bag of your m&ms.  Sorry.
1.0,Doesn't attract cluster flies,This product was of no use in catching the cluster flies that are a pest from September through January here in New England.  We set it up indoors in a spot frequented by scores of the little devils and not a one was drawn to his/her death in it.  I hope it works for other kinds of flies.
1.0,Horrible!!,"A total nightmare. If you are going to make this, use crazy glue or a support system for the walls and roof. They keep sliding out of place. Some of my pieces came broken, and it tasted horrible. Dont waste your money."
5.0,Childhood favorite!,"I loved these as a kid, but have a hard time finding them in the stores here. Amazon to the rescue!!! I love that I can buy a whole case of them and have them around for whenever I want them. This was my pregnancy craving, so I have recently run out, but am back to buy more!!!"
5.0,healthy oil,"I use this as my stir fry oil.  It appears to be healthy.  I have been using it regularly several times a week to enjoy stir fry.  I have been on a weight loss life style for about 15 months.  I have lost about 68 pounds and between this and coconut oil I eat fried food averaging about 1.5 times a day.  I have gotten off all my meds except Warfarin and my blood work came back last week mid normal range normal.  for 20 years before this I had tried to avoid fried food.  I was on blood pressure and cholesterol meds and things were getting worse instead of better.  Macadamia nut oil and Coconut oil have worked better than olive oil for me.  It's not cheap but it works for me. I am also eating more and walking 5-7 miles at least 5 days a week and I eat several pounds of black beans a week along with lots of lean pork, beef, mixed vegetables and salad from my garden.  The salad (and 2 past DVT's before this lifestyle) are the main reason I'm on warfarin."
5.0,Fantastic product,"Great tasting healthy snack.  And when I say great tasting, I mean it, I am very picky about food, so it is not ""great tasting"" for super health conscious people who only eat bad tasting health bars.  And it's great to know you are getting a ton of fiber which most of us do not get enough of!"
1.0,FAKE RED VINEGAR,Read the ingredients. FD & C Red #40. No where does it say rice vinegar. I wouldn't serve this to Hitler. Another Chinese ripoff
1.0,Very bad,"I expected the product to be good like other plum organic products. But this stinks and smells burnt food. My baby threw up once i fed her a spoon. I did taste and ""eek"" terrible. I thought the problem was with specific pack.. but no.. the product is bad.."
5.0,The best.,"Just sweet enough. No noticeable sugar. Moist. No excess packaging. Just want I needed, since there seems to be a dearth of dried cranberries in my town right now. Good enough that I think I will skip the bins in the future. These are great for snacking, trail mix, granola, and quick breads."
1.0,Stomach upset,"I have Celiac disease, and been on a GF diet for over a year.  I have not had problems with any GF foods, but each time I eat a slice of this bread, I get stomach upset.  I am not allergic to dairy or eggs.  Celiacs beware- there is something tainted in this mix."
5.0,Really tasty and quick to prepare!,"The alu methi is really good. It's pretty hot, and my SO loves the spice level; it's about 20 percent too hot for me, so I like it with lots of basmati rice, chutney, raita and naan. I like all the MTR foods that we've tried, with the exception of the pongal. (It's just too bland and rather a strange consistency.) We really like the palak paneer and the bisibele bath, and it's nice to have two or three of them with rice for a very complete meal."
1.0,No effect,This didn't have any effect on me at all - I had a few friends try them and they stated that they didn't feel anything from the energy shot(s) either.  Age range tested 20 - 25 years old.
5.0,Squashed Flies,"We were reminiscing about ""squashed fly"" cookies and I decided to check Amazon. Except for containing currants rather than raisins these are just what I was looking for. The price and shipping costs are reasonable and delivery was timely."
1.0,NOT PACKAGED FOR DELIVERY CORRECTLY,"When I took the jar out of the box and opened it - the smell was horrible , I looked at the inside of the lid and it was all black mold. Down the drain and in the garbage it went.  I have sent a message to the seller and have not not received any response."
5.0,goji LOVE,"Goji berries at the store are EXPENSIVE!  Goji berries on amazon are much cheaper...   Goji berries from navita's naturals are just the right amount of chewiness, sweetness, and tartness. They're my fave brand."
1.0,"Sweetened, not the same as cheerios","This used to be a great cereal, the only organic ""O""s cereal with the same taste, texture and mouth-feel as Cheerios.  The latest box I bought had a sweet coating that ruins the taste and feel.  Won't buy this again."
5.0,fantastic,This product is deliciuos and versatile.  It can be used in many appetizing ways.
1.0,Complete steal,"Makes no sense how the 200g package costs ~$7, and the 14.12oz costs ~$7; for those of you that are not familiar with the different unit systems 14.12oz = 400g, so you can get double the size for the same price."
1.0,Don't bother,"I wouldn't call this flaked, it is more of a disgusting ground up concoction: it smells as does all tuna. The cats gave it a definite paws down. One threw it up, one wouldn't eat it (he eats everything, even marshmellows), and the other was indifferent. We are stuck with 11 cans that will probably be donated somewhere."
5.0,Breakfast for Champions,"Twinnings has really outdone itself with this exquisite tea.  Add to that the convenience of the Keurig brewer and one finds that this tea very well may become a daily staple.  Once again, I found that this tea is excellently balanced and, contrary to some reviewers, I can personally attest that the quality is similar to that of tea brewed using a teapot.  This tea is a great tea for breakfast or any time of the day.  It is very flavorful and the package contains more than enough k-cups to make it much less expensive to drink daily, which is a good thing considering how good it tastes."
5.0,Best ever chocolate bar,I love this chocolate. It's ever so slightly crunchy because it is not conched or refined like most chocolate - fabulous!  I recommend you order in the cooler months so it doesn't alter in the heat.
5.0,revv pulse,Really like this coffee. It's very bold and very smooth - not harsh or bitter at all. I'm not sure how much of an extra boost the ginseng and guarana actually gives you but it can't hurt. Will buy again.
5.0,Great for a fat dog with a sensitive stomach,"My miniature schnauzer not only was putting on a little weight with the lamb/rice, it was making his stomach upset for a while.  On the vet's recommendation, I switched to this food and it has been great for him for over a year now.  He also gets way more excited about this food than the previous one.  Highly recommend it."
1.0,"The subscription feature should make life easier, not harder","Thankfully I happened to look at my subscription. A nearly 150% price hike, with no notification or explanation? What the hell?  Subscriptions aren't convenient if I have to babysit them for bait-and-priceswitch trickery. I'll be going to my local supermarket instead."
1.0,Rip off!,"Company charged me for three bottles of salad dressing and only shipped one!!!  If you read the description it says $3.32/unit, which means three bottles for the advertised price of $9.95.  But they only shipped one bottle."
5.0,Saving Money,"I ordered 4 bottles of joop so i could get free ups shipping.They were short one bottle but did not penalize me and i still received free ups and i do appreciate that.I also saved over $60.00.   Joe Nardone   Burbank,Illinois"
1.0,Worst popcorn I have ever eaten,"I ordered two types of popcorn at one time. One, J&D's BaconPop, the other Fireworks Red River Valley.  J&D's BaconPop has to be the worst bag popcorn I have ever tasted. I can even eat burnt popcorn but I cannot eat this stuff. Only half of each bag pops and the bacon stuff burns. It gives off a bad smell and the taste is even worse. It is like burnt salt. I tried cooking at lesser times without improved results. I even tried scraping the popcorn out of the bag and popping it on the stovetop but the results did not improve much. I thought it would be difficult to screw up popcorn but these guys did a great job of making popcorn inedible. No bacon flavor whatsoever.  J&D's BaconPop gets one star. One star is far too generous.  Red River Valley by Fireworks gets 5 stars. The best popcorn I have ever eaten.  ===== 7/14 =====  I gave this popcorn to a lady friend with two kids. They all love it. They ate every bit of it in less than one month. She now buys the popcorn at Kroger."
1.0,Incredibly Overpriced!,"Because of the way this is listed, I was expecting to receive 6 packs of 6, 1-ounce boxes, for a total of 36 boxes. However, I only received 1 six pack, which meant they cost about $3.00 per ounce. I do like the product itself, but recommend that others purchase it elsewhere."
5.0,Delicious,"I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this tea. It's mild with a slightly sweet hint and is delicious iced as well. Now when he brews sweet tea, he only likes using this blend. Shipment is always prompt and the bags they come in are resealable and do well to maintain the freshness and quality of the tea."
5.0,So that's why it costs so much!,"I was really hesitant to buy this food because it costs about twice the most expensive premium brand grocery dog food costs at the pet food store, but decided to give it a shot since Amazon offers a deal for subscribing. (I bought the 15 lb bag, which is why I don't have a verified purchase in the 30 lb listing) I honestly wouldn't even know about this product if our new puppy's breeder hadn't recommended it, and was using it on their pups. I'm not one of those people that have to eat organic, or those guys that have to have the word ""holistic"" on their animals' food. In fact, I usually just buy what's on sale, as long as it meets my personal quality standards. But after trying this, it kind of makes sense why they cost more.  When I first opened the bag, I noticed that it did not have that strong dog food scent that most dog foods I've purchased for my dogs have. It actually smells kind of good, to where I would almost be brave enough to taste it. Second, the kibble size is perfect for my golden retriever puppy. Not too big or small, and it perfect for training treats. In the morning before feeding my dogs in their bowl, I usually let them earn their meal through training, and these are perfectly sized and tasty enough to use for that. The outer layer seems almost coated, so you don't get kibble crumbs in your hand and into your fingertips. Third, and most importantly- It's really good for your dog! Prior to buying our new puppy, I did a lot of research (as a good prospective dog owner should) on raising a healthy dog. One of the biggest things that stuck with me was that you WILL pay for your dogs' health- either in the form of good dog food, or in the form of a vet bill. Have a nice day:)"
1.0,Chemical Ali tea.,This is the worst tea known to man taste nothing like iced tea and im suprised no one has filed a class action lawsuit against Lipton for this false advertising of Chemical Ali in a can stick with nestea or arnold palmer.
1.0,***NOT*** GLUTEN FREE,"This product has two markings:  1. Gluten Free  2. Allergen Information: This product was packed on equipment that also packages products that contain milk, soy, wheat, and tree nuts.  Unfortunately, I was so happy to see ""gluten free,"" I failed to read on to see the allergen statement which indicates the exact opposite of ""gluten free."" I ate these for two days - and paid for it each time - before I realized my mistake in trusting the first indication of ""gluten free.""  If you are allergic to gluten or a celiac, DO NOT consume this product.  I am very disappointed when businesses don't take these allergies seriously - in this case, by placing two contradictory statements regarding allergens on their packaging, and, of course, emphasizing the one that increases the appeal of the product to a specific group of people vulnerable to allergic reactions. In particular, reactions due to celiac have permanent effects on people's lives and health, including an increased risk of cancer, and a failure to recognize this is blatantly irresponsible and should be prosecuted."
5.0,Very Durable,"This is a great toy for heavy chewers. I have a pit bull mix who has played with this toy for over a month now, and it is still in good condition. I didn't see how this large plastic object would be appealing to my dog, so I had peanut butter ready just in case. However, I didn't need it, as he chewed on it for a good hour the first time I gave it to him. He still chews on it from time to time, and aside from small particles that he chews off, the whole toy is still intact. I highly recommend this toy. I also suggest taking it away from your dog for a period of time so that when you give it back to him, he will still be excited to play with it."

5.0,Energy up the @#$!,"I had heard good things from my friends about 5-hour energy, and I really needed a boost one day after school. I had a couple hours of jujitsu training that day, and I was in desperate need of a wake-up. I walked a couple miles home and on my way, I stopped and grabbed a 5-hour energy. I took it at 3:30, and by 4:45 (when training class started) I felt great. I went through the 2 hours of training just fine, but what really surprised me was that I still had a TON of energy after that. I really felt the need to burn that energy, so at 7:30 I decided to go for a run. A while later, I realized that I just run 5 miles. The energy wasn't an intense sugar high either. It just felt like I could run and never stop. I probably could have gone even further if my leg muscles were in better shape (I usually don't run very long distances). This product did what it advertised and was WAY better than I expected. Will definitely buy again."
1.0,Uncle Eddie's Trail Mix  is Terrible,Maybe you have to have a taste for these cookies. I bought them and hated them. The Chocolate Chip/Walnut and the Oatmeal Raisin were delectable but the Trail Mix was not. I love these brand of cookies but the Trail Mix is not my cup of tea.
1.0,problems with recent batch,"My first can of Happybellies oatmeal was cream-colored and odorless, my second can was greenish-brown and smelled rancid (I immediately threw it out), and the third can was also greenish-brown in color but smelled a little less rancid.  Serious quality issues considering the high price and brand image.  I don't recommend this oatmeal until they acknowledge and resolve this issue."
5.0,My Favorite Lunch,"I love this product, I had gastric bypass surgery just over a year ago and my favorite lunch has become smoked oysters on crackers w/cheese. This product is tasty, just the right size/amount,and priced right for me to enjoy as often as I like"
5.0,The Cinnamon Grahams are great!,"I have ordered these twice now, they taste so good! I also tried the chocolate wheat-free ones, they were awful, I would not order them again, but have been waiting several weeks for the grahams to be stocked!"
5.0,Long Lasting,"The dogs are still playing with the first bones I purchased over a year ago.  They cleaned it up pretty quick, but all three are still gnawing on the original bones."
1.0,"Great on smell, too much ginger","I', a fan of lemon and ginger.  I enjoy teas and I will use fresh ginger in recipes.  But this was downright awful.  I followed the instructions, and the smell was so wonderful.  It reminded me of a fancy tea house.  Then I tasted it... yuck... burning sensation from the ginger.  I do not recommend this, unless ginger 'burns' are your thing."
1.0,Disappointed but . . .,"Amazon offering Community Coffee delighted us; it's been a favorite for years but this coffee is either stale or something's seriously changed in their roasting. No matter how strong we made the brew in our French Press, and in a perculoator, the beans just did not evidence the delights of the past.  We had to cancel our Subscribe and Save and tell friends who joined Prime to get this! Sad, but if you don't notice the grand scent of the beans, return it!  PS I did not do that, and called Community Coffee instead! My batch was ""Best Brew Date"" of 1/18/12, and they KNEW what was wrong, and told me to contact Amazon, which I should have done in the first place. Thank goodness, our fav coffee mystery has been solved! If you have that date on your coffee bags, contact Amazon!"
1.0,Different bag; different food,"I have been buying Friskies dry cat food, mainly their seafood flavor but sometimes others, for 4+ years. My cats liked the taste and for the cheap price compared to others I was satisfied. Until they changed the bag design, that is. I say bag because that is what the label said. ""different bag, same great taste"" or something like that.  When I picked the bag up from Target, I had expected to see the same food I had always bought.  When I opened it, I quickly realized this was not the same food.  The shapes were the same, but the colors were noticeably brighter and more vibrant.  It was eye-appealing, but apparently not taste-appealing.  My cats barely touched it, one of them didn't eat it at all.  And when they munched it down reluctantly, they threw up and got diarrhea. ALL of them. We had to throw the junk out and buy a bag of something else.  Unfortunately, my lack of money has forced be to purchase Friskies on and off frequently over the past year, though I no longer buy that flavor, OR the flavor of the bright orange bag. The other flavors seem a bit milder, and the cats only throw up every once in awhile, though they still get cases of diarrhea too often. If I had enough money I'd check them out at the vet (along with getting the cat-food tested).  Recently though I found another bag of dried cat-food that was a bit cheaper than Friskies and there's been a definite improvement in their stools since they tried it. No one has thrown-up. I may just stick with this one.  I've looked up information about Friskies, and while I never expected them to be top-quality for the cheap price, I was more or less disturbed by the constant complaints customers had.  Almost every site I looked at concerning Friskies had people saying their cats died or were throwing up/getting diarrhea. Calling the company does little good, as their standard reply seems to be: ""orly? This is first we've ever heard about it!"""
1.0,Why Did They Change It???,"I used to love Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk and bought it by the case. But they clearly changed the product and ruined a good thing.  The old Thai Kitchen was thick and wonderful. It separated in my fridge and even on my kitchen counter if it was below 70 degrees or so. It whipped up into a lovely whipped cream.  This stuff has the consistency of skim milk. It doesn't separate or harden even in the fridge. It doesn't whip up like heavy cream. The flavor seems watered-down.  Apparently these folks never heard the adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
1.0,Where's the Bergamot?,"I was hoping to like this tea as I love Earl Grey and some green teas and thought this would have more health benefits than the normal Earl Grey. I couldn't taste any bergamot to speak of in this tea. Also, even though I love Twinings Earl Grey and some green teas such as Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Orchard, Salada, and others, I did not like combining the two. It was like I could not taste what was good about either teas in this and will now keep my black teas and my green teas separated from each other so that I can taste what is good about each in it's own way. Also, I've found the Bigelow's that I've tried so far to be rather flat and lacking any of the delicacy or subtle complexities of many other brands."
1.0,Yucky,I ended up throwing them all out because they were extrememly tough and not very tasty.
1.0,Absolutely horrible!,"I was really excited to try these cookies when I first saw them in the grocery store. We didn't buy them right away and when I found them offered through the Vine program I was quite pleased. Fig and Honey wouldn't have been my first flavor choice, but as I do like regular Fig Newtons, I figured I'd give them a try. How bad could they be? The answer is...very, very bad.  I like cinammon but the cinammon in this cookie was both overpowering and artificial tasting. Something was just ""off"" and ""too strong"" about them. It might be whatever other ""natural flavors"" are in the cookie and not just the cinammon, I'm not sure, but something just didn't work and the cookie had a bad aftertaste. My 11 year old son said he thought they had a bad ""before"" and ""middle"" taste too! I can't argue with him there.  The dried fruit bits were equally bothersome. They made the cookie difficult to eat as the bits were too chewy and stuck in my teeth. I don't want to have to pick fruit bits out of my teeth when I eat a cookie.  All in all, this cookie was a huge disappointment.  My children wouldn't even take a second bite of the cookies and I wasn't too thrilled about eating more myself.  As a fan of fruit newtons (both fig and other flavors), I had high hopes for these cookies. If the basic cookie for all of the flavors is the same, I won't bother trying any of the other flavors."
5.0,Excellent Quality Product. Value for money.,See above. The product was excellent. Family was not disappointed in any aspects of usage. Delivery was on the button.Thanks
1.0,UGH! YECH! PEW!,"I don't know why these things are called mints. They sure don't taste minty.  I bought a box, tried some, gave some away and NOBODY could get past the first few minutes without spitting them out. They taste like soap and smell floral!  I guess you need to be raised with these things to appreciate them."
1.0,Shipped wrong product,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of these, the wide noodles are hard to find. Apparently they're hard to find for Amazon, too, because these are not the noodles I got. Got the plain old skinny ones. And they can't claim they were packaged wrong, package doesn't claim to be wide style.  I'm going to try elsewhere to find what I wasted my money on this time."
1.0,Not what I expected... at all,"I was looking for something against clothes eating moths and bought this one. But on the back of the box it says that this ""trap"" does not catch/trap adult moths.... I guess it was not as useful as I needed."
5.0,Cats love gravy!,"I have one cat that will eat anything, but for my other cat, when it comes to wet food, he mostly just licks all the gravy off and leaves the chunks behind.  When I saw that this product was specifically designed to have more gravy, I decided to try it on my gravy-loving cat.  He happily licked up every bit of gravy (still left most of the chunks behind, which the other cat ate).  Truly a fantastic product for cats that prefer gravy!"
5.0,"A coffee for all you ""Light Brew"" drinkers out there!","This Breakfast Blend coffee is very mellow and satisfying! It makes a nice companion to, or just a little change up from my favorite Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast blend! It also comes at a decent price per cup!"
1.0,Ripoff!,I get a 64 oz. bottle of this in the store for $8.  If it was three 64-oz bottles it still wouldn't be worth it.  Wondered if they made a mistake in listing this.
1.0,looked like candy sat on shelf for a while,candy arrived in broken pieces. And package looked like it was old and had been sitting around for a while. Very disappointing
5.0,So far the best tasting green tea!,"I like this green tea ,as it does not dry my mouth and does not give me that after taste effect!  What makes it better for me if I add a little bit of instant honey ginger flavor to it."
1.0,STALE,"This coffee and another  WP variety that I ordered  arrived so stale that I could barely tolerate the smell of it in my kitchen.  I'm going to call amazon and see if I can get a refund.  YUK, YUK, YUK"
1.0,BIG mistake,"i just received  my cans and should have listened to the reviews. i tried to be positive and go with the reviews who received the cans in perfect shape. what a mistake. ALL but 2 cans were severely dented. the other 2 still had dents. i don't think i could open them if i tried, but i would be afraid to eat the product anyway. i will not pay to send them back. they were wrapped well in bubble wrap so they weren't damaged in transit. they were sent out with the sender KNOWINGLY sending imperfect cans. they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they want them back they should pay for the shipping!  i WILL not be taken in again. i want my money back. this is the FIRST item from amazon i have not been happy with."
5.0,Monster M-80,I love the M-80. It is usually the only E-drink that I will drink!!! I drink 1(one) per day!! Hated it when I found out that most stores would not carry the M-80!! Now I have amazon deliver 1 or 2 cases a month!!! Cheeper than in a store!!!!! Hope this helps!!!! WAR EAGLE!!!
1.0,Disappointed,"I was VERY excited to order this Barney Butter after reading about it in a magazine, and I loved the idea of the individual packets.  However, I was extremely disappointed to find that the almond butter was rock hard and dry within the packets, with a little bit of oil at the bottom and no possible way to mix the two together.  When I sampled it, it was like chewing on rubber.  I ended up throwing the entire box into the garbage."
1.0,Not Good,"I found this at Walmart for $3.00, and on taste alone, it is way overpriced. I'm not sure how they pass this stuff off. Like another reviewer said, the texture is weird. It honestly made me feel like I was eating dirt. The sauce isn't good, either. I could taste just a hint, a very fleeting hint, of alfredo. Even the pasta they use tastes weird. It doesn't look very appealing when cooked, either. My husband didn't even want to try it. Never again."
5.0,really good freshest we have had,"this is the only twizzler my wife will eat and these are the freshest we could have found. The stores around here never has this flavor and when they do it's stale we will be buying from you all the while, thanks for having this and so many other things we love."
1.0,Worst Coffee I Ever Tried To Drink,"Hey Tiny Footprint, light roast coffee beans are light brown; these beans are dark brown. There were mistakes made somewhere! This coffee is BLAH tasting, rather like dog pooh smells. In fact, this coffee is so bad I wouldn't let my dog drink it. Hey Amazon, the cabon negative story is appealing, but this coffee is a reject!"
5.0,My dog Rocky loves Happy Hips and they agree with his sensitive stomch.,"Rocky is a beautiful Collie but a very picky eater with a sensitive stomach.  He will not eat store bought dog bones and I have made him home made ones in the past.  However, he loves Happy Hips and they agree with his sensitive stomach, so they are not only good for him but apparently taste good also."
5.0,"Sweet with a ""kick""!","As a previous reviewer stated, this mustard packs a punch.  But if you like things on the hot 'n' spicy side, you'll love this.  Use it in moderation the first time, just to get a feel for the spiciness level.  Then adjust later as needed.  I love it on brats, kielbasa, knockwurst, hot dogs, burgers, and I use it in marinades for chicken (mix with some lemon juice, oil, and a little minced garlic) or for grilling salmon (thin with a little oil, then brush on the salmon and grill).  I'm a big fan of the Beaver line of sandwich spreads/mustards/etc.  This one is near the top of my list."
5.0,Great tea!,"This is strong, so maybe water it down with lots of ice cubes or put milk and sugar in it."
1.0,Bland tasting,"I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder."
5.0,From a picky eater - I love these,"I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc. I decided to give them a try and figured if we did not like them, they could be donated.  I ordered a mixed case the first time around to see which flavors we liked more (or less) and thought that would give us a good sampling.  After deciding we liked most of the flavors, we decided to try other ones as well.  Despite the flavor preferences, these chips do not taste like cardboard.  At first taste, they are a little crunchier and thicker than you might expect. I think this is a good thing, because it means they are not heavily-laden with oil.  The 0.8 oz bags are 100 calories each as well, which is much better than the other alternatives and gives you the enjoyment of chips without the extra calories, trans fat, etc.  I have included a summary of opinions below from myself, friends and family for each flavor:  Sea Salt & Vinegar - Great, the absolute favorite flavor for everyone BBQ - Very good, I'm not crazy about BBQ to begin with but would say this flavor is ""sweet"" BBQ. Everyone else loved them. Cheddar - Very Good, probably close in preference to the BBQ Original Potato - Good, but a little salty (seems to fluctuate somewhat between bags) Salt & Pepper - Good, everyone liked them but preferred other flavors more Parmesan Garlic - Good, but overall was 50/50. You definitely taste more parmesan than garlic and most people were expecting the latter. Sour Cream & Onion - Not so good, no one really liked these enough to want more or to even finish the bag  I know taste is a very subjective thing, but I hope this review helps someone decide to give these a try. I did get them at a reduced price through subscribe & save, and shortly after my first order, Amazon had them on the Gold Box for an even better price.  I think the average price per bag came out to approximately forty six cents a bag and had free shipping under my prime account."

WE USED THE HERSEHEY'S REGULAR CHOCOLATE SYRUP AND THOUGHT IT HAD TOO MUCH SUGAR IN IT, IN THAT IT STARTED TO PUT WEIGHT ON HER. WE SWITCHED TO THE SUGAR FREE BRAND AND WERE PLEASED SHE LIKED IT AS MUCH AS THE SUGAR SYRUP. WE ARE HOPING THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME OF HER WEIGHT LOSS."
1.0,Nastiest Sweetener Ever,"Put this in my homemade lemonade, had to throw it out. It is BY FAR the worst non-sugar sweetener I've ever had. It's bitter, oily-tasting and the taste is still in my mouth a full hour after one sip. Going to try either actual stevia (not this extract junk) or an artificial sweetener."
1.0,not as advertised,You are not buying 25 hooves as the details state.  You are buying 1 chew hoof.  Had no problems with company refunding me the price i payed and they also sent me another hoof free of charge.
5.0,Absolutely Delicious!!,"Monin Flavored Syrup Coconut is the best out there and I have tried a few.  Be careful, it is very addicting.  My daughter went through a couple bottles in just a few weeks."
5.0,The story tells the review.,"Met my friend at a sandwich shop, brought a thermos of this coffee. I had added a little soymilk to lighten, she thought the coffee was too weak. The pot was black as night. The taste was smooth as hell, and 30 minutes later, she was a little spun out of control.  It is by far, the smoothest coffee blend I've had, and is great stuff. Just because a cup might be so bitter from various alkaloids, doesn't make it superior coffee. This stuff truly equates to quality."

5.0,best tea to have at night,"If you don't always fall asleep as fast as you would like, drink Bigelow's Sweet Dreams tea. It really does help you to sleep better."
5.0,Suprised!,"This tea is wonderful!  I say I'm suprised simply because I am used to ""bargain"" pricing to mean less than top quality (which I'm ok with if the price is right).  That is NOT the case with this tea (or the African Honeybush I have on auto order) It's a great balance of chamomille and fruit.. brews into a light slightly sweet tea. Great after a stressful day... or as I found recently... put it over ice and it's calming and cool after a hot day working in the yard and garden. I share with my daughters so I'm sure this tea will eventually go on the auto order just like the African Honeybush."
1.0,"Keep shopping, I implore you","If you're looking for a beef jerky you can (and will) feed your dog, look no further. With no discernable taste and a texture that resembles  Beggin' Strips  at twice the price, Wild Ride Gallopin' Pepper Beef Jerky for Dogs is an all-natural choice.  The meat is weirdly soft and completely tasteless. Not salty, nor peppery, nor meaty. I took one bite and immediately spit it in the trash. And 5 out of 5 friends agree: It's garbage. To add insult to injury, one of the bags was ripped down the middle. So it was *actually* garbage.  These bags of ""beef jerky"" have utterly offended me. Heed my warning and stay away."
1.0,Absolutely Terrible,"Two types of coffee.  The majority was decaf, and the remainder was sour and spoiled.  Will never buy again.  ""No More Than 3 of Any Variety"" is a complete and utter lie."
5.0,My Absolute Favorite Hot Cereal,"I eat this cereal most mornings in the winter.  I love the creamy, smooth texture.  I make it with almond milk and cinnamon.  It cooks up perfect in the microwave every time.  Added benefit - it's rich in fiber.  I definitely recommend it."
5.0,Delicious Blend,"This may be a tea that I will stick with - it's a whole leaf tea in a delicious India/China blend with an impressively complex and well-balanced flavor.  Attractively and conveniently packaged, and shipped regularly in small amounts to ensure freshness (the Subscribe & Save option is a MUST.) I may have found what I have been looking for!"
5.0,Best Green Tea,The tea is remarkably good. Gave up on the poison  (coffee) I had been drinking and Bigelow Green is the best of the several I tried.  The order came in short time so I have been all around pleased
1.0,Not my nut bar,"I did not like the taste of this; tasted more like the stuff you feed the birds. The sweet and salt combination does not work well for any candy bar. Although this is a little larger than granola bar, I much rather have granola bar. Lessening the salt content and increasing the cashew nuts may improve the product.  1.

1.0,My Cairn Terriers Would Not Chew Them; Does Not Mean They are Bad,"I have two nine year old Cairn Terriers.  I have been trying everything to keep their teeth clean to avoid putting them under anesthesia to have their teeth cleaned by my veterinarian.  I bought these and my guys would not go near them.  They look great and smell good too.  I finally gave them to my neighbor who just adopted a rescue Cockapoo pup.  He is still a puppy and liked them because he needs to chew all the time.  So, if you are planning on buying these, just know that I tried them, they look great, but they got rejected.  Some pups like them and some pups do not.  They made a great welcome gift for the new adopted puppy and that makes me feel great, so my investment was not wasted."
5.0,Super tasty,"I was hesitant to purchase this, despite the outstanding reviews, because of the price. I mean, what could be cheaper than rice and toasted seaweed?  With that perspective, I was very pleased with these meals/snacks. The rice was more delicious than the freshly made white rice served in many places (possibly even better than the rice in my house) and the wraps are super delicate and with a nice lightly crispy texture that is most enjoyable.  If you like sushi wraps and rice, I highly recommend you try these."
5.0,So yummy!!!,"This is exactly like the mazapanes of my childhood. Absolutely yummy. This is not your typical Italian or Spanish marzipan, these are much lighter and creamier. De la Rosa has been making these candies for years and years and they are the best!"
5.0,"Great & healthy bamboo, decent holding piece","I just got my bamboo today.  It arrived so so quickly (that's why the shipping costs are so much- they ship it USPS, but it's SUPER quick; they're located in CA, and I got it in three days.  I'm in IL)  The bamboo arrived healthy, and looked just as tall as the picture shows, and very green.  Looks wonderful.  I also purchased some Super Green from KL Design & Import; and got that the same day too (highly recommend that to go with Bamboo)  Anyway, my only disappointment was that the photo shows a lovely holding piece; looks almost like a dark wood or ceramic piece.  The one that it comes with is much lighter colored (look at the user pics) and has a random leaf printing on it.  It's not nearly as nice looking, so that is a bummer.  I wish it was darker.  That's my only complaint.  Will update if I have anything to add later on.  Still a great bamboo piece, and I recommend seller.  It will live in my office cubicle to brighten things up. :)  EDIT: April 10th, 2012  Just giving an update on this.  The bamboo is still healthy, and growing great.  My one disappointment was that the spiral piece that came with it has not grown at all since I got it.  It's still the same size, and with the same leaves.  It's still green and alive, but has not shot up and grown new leaves like the other two straight stalks.  I may actually break off the spiral part and let it grow more naturally."
5.0,Fantastic!  This mustard is incredible!,"This is not a wimpy yellow mustard.  It has a kick!  If you want plain-old-yellow-mustard, buy a generic bottle from the grocery store.  If you want a mustard with a bit of a zing (like a little wasabi on sushi), then give Coleman's a try.  Beautiful color, wonderful flavor, and smooth consistency. Highly recommended."
1.0,Suisse Mocha Decaf Sugar Free,"This is the worst tasting coffee ever made. It has a distinctly metal taste, and I'd never buy it again."
1.0,"Get educated, save $","Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:  Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:    -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces   -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller   -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled   -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal   -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening   agent.  This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of ""guaranteed uniformity"" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.  All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove. Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. ""chi"").  I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.  Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the ""Rolls Royce"" of oats, there is a brand called ""Really Raw Oats"". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.  The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.  p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's. I purchased from Lynn Paterson, who was pictured in David Sergel's fine book, ""Zen Shiatsu""  Bon Appeite, Good Health and Caveat Emptor  -Andrew"
1.0,Have ordered before but this shipment was unusable,"The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen ""ice"" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.  Years ago ""Grecian Delight"" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.  The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.  I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to."
5.0,The BEST Dog Treat Ever,My Mini Poodle won't eat any dog treats. I have wasted hundreds of dollars. I bought this & she goes hog wild over it.  I can't believe her. I have ordered many other flavors of this brand. It is also very healthy & no by-products in it. Try it..your dog will love it.
1.0,"Good product, but too expensive on Amazon","Gatorade made from the powder mix doesn't taste syrupy like store-bought Gatorade does.  It's also much less expensive to mix your own -- think about it, why would you pay for a bottle of water + flavor syrup?  HOWEVER, the prices for this product on Amazon and eBay are very inflated.  I found it at my local grocery store (HEB) for about $7, which was on sale from about $8.  The online prices are ridiculous."
1.0,"bad candy, inaccurate description","For one thing, these aren't the eyeball candy I was looking for my Halloween dinner to put on my cupcake, the eyeballs are only on the wrapper, not on the candy itself. Secondly, these candy taste old and yucky, the filling is very dry and stick to my teeth like crazy, I thought I'll just have to eat them since I can't use them for my cupcake decoration, but they're no good at all. I could have returned it, but it doesn't even worse the trouble, so I just throw them all out in my garbage can!"
5.0,A Must-Have Item,This salt is outstanding on everything!  It adds so much flavor.  I love the size of the granules and it is so much better than ordinary salt.  I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.
5.0,"Ooohhhh, these are GOOD brownies!","I've tried quite a few different brands of gluten-free brownie mixes, and this has got to be my favorite!  I find that some GF foods tend to be a bit more dry (compared to wheat-based), but this brownie mix makes a great, very moist and fudgy brownie.  Instead of the oil, I often use a small cup of applesauce (I like the stuff without added sugar) and 1/2 cup of Eggbeaters.  The taste is still great and it's a bit lower in fat."
5.0,Great Coffee for double the price,"This coffee is great, but honestly after a little searching the price here is ridiculous. I found this exact same product for about half the cost off another website."
1.0,damaged cans,"sent a case of this product to my brother,he stated numerous cans had tops dented and crushed. thank you ups. i ordered a case in glass bottles a short time ago all were intact.sure am glad i didnt have same driver it would have benn a real mess"
1.0,NOT SO HAPPY,"I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO USE IT. WHEN I RECEIVED IT, SOME OF IT WAS IN THE BAG I WAS NOT SURE IF I SHOULD USE IT SO I SENT IT BACK. I DID NOT WANT TO RATE IT, BUT THE WAY YOU HAVE IT SET UP YOU HAVE TO. I NEVER TASTE IT"
1.0,UGH.,"Saw these on Dr. Oz as a great snack.  22 chips per serving...I couldn't eat 3.  They stick to your teeth. I want to trick myself into thinking it taste just like a banana chip...it doesn't.  NO thanks.  Like, ew."
5.0,Good Stuff!,"This is a delicious drink and it gets me going for a great workout.  i wish it didn't have such a cost difference from the Turbo Tea, but I guess it worth it to get a boost to my workouts."
1.0,Waste of Money,"I received this product as a gift.  I was so excited to use it.  However, I'm sadly disappointed with this product.  The puree is very weak!  It takes far too long to blend the products, having to stop many times to stir the contents because it doesn't blend evenly.  The only nice feature is the clean-up--only one bowl to wash.  This is totally overpriced.  I wouldn't even buy it if it were under $20.  Save the money and use a blender."
5.0,AWESOME CEREAL,"I LOVE THIS CEREAL.  NOT ONLY DOES IT TASTE GOOD, IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.  IT'S A PITY THAT I CAN'T FIND THIS CEREAL IN ANY OF THE LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.  OTHER BRANDS DO NOT MATCH UP."
5.0,Salty Licorice = Deliciousness,"This is sort of like a salty black licorice.  It is not for everyone.  In fact, most people who try it, don't seem to like it (at least those in the U.S.).  They are great by themselves or with a beer."
1.0,Beware! Bad batch made me sick 4/10/11!,"I love heath bars, and they agree with me quite well.  Unfortunately, I ordered this item and even without eating a whole one, I got sick from it and have been all night, and am still.  The bar was ""off"" with a slightly odd taste and the center was a bit ""chewy"" rather than crisp. Odd enough that I set it aside after eating part of it.  Soon I was queasy and I slept badly, and now 12 hours later it feels like there are knives in my intestines and I'm having diarrhea.  Amazon was good about it, gave me a full refund and told me to dispose of them, which I will do. Into the trash they go.  The lot number is a bit smudged on the box, but appears to be  40PR2 BB 01 2012  I don't blame amazon, but I feel like I've been poisoned.  And no, I didn't eat anything else, it was utterly clear what has made me ill. Also, the same day I had some heath miniatures I also bought from amazon, and they were great!  I suspect that I'm not the only person to get a bellyache from this batch.  These should be recalled, IMO."
1.0,Disgusting,"I can't even GIVE these things away.  The best description I can come up with is ""Sawdust surrounded by wax.""  Does not taste like white chocolate (or ANY type of chocolate) in the least.  I've yet to know anyone who can actually swallow a bite of one of these.  I have a ""HELP YOURSELF"" sticky note on the box at the office and everyone who has tried it, has SPIT IT OUT and tossed it in the trash.  Save your money."
1.0,What have you done?,"This is NOT the same honey, as contained in the 23 oz. bottles I've ordered in the past. MUCH lighter in color and RUNNIER! I immediately cancelled my 'sub/save'...WHY DO THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE...FOR THE WORST?!"
1.0,Grossest cola ever,"I've had the  SodaStream SodaMix - Cola  before, and it was fine. It tasted like someone mixed a diet soda with a regular one with the slight aftertaste of sucralose, but it wasn't that bad, and the  SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer  was one of the best root beers I've ever had even WITH that aftertaste. I gambled on the Natural Cola, hoping it would taste like the regular one but without that aftertaste, but boy was I wrong. It tastes like you took some apple juice and mixed it with cola.  (The natural rootbeer, incidentally, is freaking awesome - it IS the   SodaStream SodaMix - Caffeine Free Root Beer  without the aftertaste. So my order was only half fail, ha. Amazon apparently doesn't sell it.)"
5.0,Ginger drink with a bite.,"If you like ginger tea than you'll love Ginger drink. It has a little bit of a bite, but that's what makes this drink good."
5.0,My favorite Hot Cocoa!,"I bought a combo pack at Sams club, it had 8 different flavors, all were great, but my favorite by far is Arctic White.  Much to my surprise it was hard to get a large quantity of the stuff, even the manufacturer wanted way too much money, and then I found it on Amazon, great price great product!!"
5.0,Delicioso!,This is very good coffee. I will definitely purchase it again. It is robust and flavorful without any trace of bitterness. Love it!
5.0,The healthier ones,"These are a healthier version of Craisins, and to my mind much better tasting.  They are super moist and slightly less sweet. Eden adds no refined sugar;  instead, these cranberries are sweetened with organic apple juice concentrate.  (Don't allow yourself to think that they are ""sugar-free,"" however. The juice concentrate is still a strong source of natural sugars, which for a 1/3 cup serving of cranberries total 25 grams.) All that being said, if you are looking for a healthier, moist, good-tasting dried cranberry (and organic, to boot,) this is it."
5.0,Delicious!,"The flavor is very light and crisp, tastes kind of like a green apple with a bit of a kick. One tiny little packet will last you quite awhile, or if you're having a party will provide enough for everyone. If you want to add a bit more kick it tastes great with a little splash of coconut rum. :D"
5.0,Good baby food.,excellent product.My baby like the taste of it and easy to digest.Fast shipping.I would recommend the product.Wants to try the other flavors too.
1.0,too much sweetener,I ordered this recently. The sugar-free has so much sweetener in it that it literally turns my stomach. I never put more than 3 squirts into 6 cups of coffee and milk. The flavor is absolutely missing and overpowered by the sickly sweet syrup.
5.0,German Gummie Bears are the best!,"I have to be one of the biggest customers for Haribou Gummie Bears, which I have been purchasing for nearly 10 years now. I am not a big candy officianado but I can tell you that Haribou is the 'real deal!!"" I have tried others, too soft, medicinal tasting, and like Baby Bears Porridge, Haribou's is ....just right!! I love that they sell them in 5lb bags and I always order (2) at a time as they have a way of disappearing very fast...I've gotten my grandkids hooked on them. Easy to transport for snacks and fun to eat!! One drawback might be if you have dentures....these will definitely do a number on these so watch out and maybe stick with the cheap immitation!! I have never had a 'tooth problem' so to speak so for all other's, enjoy!!"
1.0,not like Jelly Belly,not like Jelly Belly they did not tasted like Jelly Belly. the Jelly beans had a funny off tastes. do not sell ?
1.0,not even close to coconut water!,"Coconut water should not be sweetened!!! Actually ""NO SUGAR SHOULD EVER BE ADDED"" sweeting things is an american custom, which ruins the real flavor of coconut water. I lived in Jamaica for 4 years and the bahamas for 2, and the coconut water from real coconut does not have any added sugar, its natural. I will stick to buying the brown hard shell coconuts from the supermarket and drink that it's more natural and unaltered. These boxed, caned and packaged coconut water are nasty, i am still yet to try a brand, one of the many that i have tried that will make me wanna buy it."
5.0,Great blend of Flavors,"I tried this flavor in a mixed package from the grocery store, but I only liked the lemon flavor.  It has a nice blend of lemon and other herbs.  It does not even need to be sweetened.  I am glad that I can order just the lemon herbal tea."
5.0,hey they're oreos...,what can i say... great cookies. the only way to improve it is if it came with some cold milk.
1.0,Cat food,"I love salmon spread.  I buy it here in MA, but thought it would be better from Alaska.  I ordered this item because I just returned from Alaska and had the best salmon and salmon spread there.  I ordered this item hoping that it would be fantastic because Alaska is known for its salmon.  I was VERY disappointed.  It tasted and smelled like cat food!  I did write to the company, but have yet to receive a response."
1.0,Really horrible,This is really horrible coffee. It is especially bad in an espresso machine. The taste is completely different than the Lavazza beans that come in a blue bag. There is a reason this brown bag is cheaper.
5.0,love it,"love the True Lemon. Two packets makes a big glass of lemonade for my taste.  Just to mention - those 500 packets are just in a box, not packaged neatly. I'm not going to count to see if there are actually 500 there, though."
1.0,I couldn't even finish one can,"I have always been a huge Diet Pepsi fan, but I have recently decided to give up aspartame.  So I searched online and found this product.  So you've heard the saying ""If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.""  Well that is definitely the case with Zevia Cola.  I honestly had a hard time getting it down.  I can't believe people are giving it 4 and 5 stars.  They must work for the company or something because it is nasty.  There is an awful after taste.  Luckily, I only bought a six pack at the grocery store and so I only have 5 left over cans instead of 23.  I would honestly be embarassed to offer them to guests (even my little nephews).  However, I did read one review that said it was okay mixed with rum.  I also tried the ginger root beer and it was delicious.  However, it doesn't have any caffeine so it's not really a substitute for Diet Pepsi.  I'm going to try the Dr. Zevia and the Mountain Zevia since they are the only two other Zevias that contain caffeine.  Then I'll give up and go back to my Diet Pepsi.  Maybe I'll just cut back on the number of cans I go through."
1.0,poorly wrapped almond butter,I got my almond butter in the mail and opened it.  too my surprize i found chunks of almond butter all around inside the box.  the almond butter become unsealed and splattered all arround inside the box during shipping the shippers never heard of wrapping the almond butter in bubble wrap.  in order for it to arrive to my house safely from amazon.com.  the bottles where never comletely inclosed in bubble wrap.  i called amazon.com up and they dont want me to return the broken jars of almond butter  i can not eat them after this amazon.com says they will refund  my gift cards i am sure glad they take my word for it amazon. is great they reallystand behind what they sell at amazon.com i will continue to shop there
5.0,for fretting felines and canines,"This 100% natural product for cats and dogs going through stressful times includes the same active ingredients as those for the relief of tension in some natural human formulas, like valerian and chamomile, and also apparently has a good taste, as a dropper full of the liquid in food is devoured with relish; it also includes passion flower and fructose, which is probably why it has a sweet aroma, and adds to the palatability. Other ingredients are hops, scull cap, and inert ingredients include deionized water and sodium benzoate.  I've found it very useful on two occasions, once when trying to catch a young feral kitty, and secondly, to relieve the anxiety of my devoted eight year old Liddy when introducing the young cat into the household. Also good for pets that are nervous travelers, and those few animals that get upset when being groomed.  Richard's Organics Pet Calm claims that it ""Treats short-term stress"", and in my situations, it has worked beautifully. Depending on the size of the dog or cat (1 dropper = 1 ml. / Up to 40 lbs., 1-4 ml. / Over 40 lbs., 3-6 ml.), there are a lot of doses in this 2 oz. bottle, and I think it's an excellent value.  Liddy, Maggie and I are very satisfied customers of this product, which has made our lives easier and more peaceful."
1.0,Terrible Taste,"This product is a disappointment. There was more of a candy coating than sunflower seed and the candy was not tasty at all. It had a stale and smoky quality to it that I did not expect and I could not find one person that tried them who liked the taste at all. The best part of these, unfortunately, is their look and vibrant colors - that's about it."
5.0,Good tea,Nice robust flavor.  Tastes very good with cream and sugar or black.  I will continue to buy it.
1.0,Bad!!!,Two of the three plants were dying and are now dead. They all were tiny!!! They are suppose to catch flies but not one fly has been caught because they couldn't even fit in the bloom.  Rip Off!!! Do not do business with this vendor...
1.0,do you really need this?,Please consider whether you want to buy and consume something that was created in an inhumane way. There is no humane way to create a product like this.
1.0,Worse than instant,I'm pretty certain any brand of instant coffee is better than this.  We recently moved into a building that has a few of these machines that offer the Columbia and it is just awful (especially considering the premium pricing).
5.0,Yummy,"I got theses yesterday, tried a couple, and put them out on the counter. Everyone in the house has been grabbing one as they walk by. There are only three left.  These cookies are light,crispy and flavorful. They're just sweet enough to satisfy without loading you up with sugar.  These are a winner. I'm going to snag one of the last ones now while I have a chance."
5.0,Best decaf hot tea I have tasted!,"I buy this in the UK but it is wonderful to know I can get it here if supplies run low between trips! I recommend steeping the bag for several minutes, then adding milk and sugar to taste. It has been a lifesaver during cold and flu season. I prefer it to PG Tips, which I find to be quite bitter. Typhoo has a much smoother taste."
5.0,best cereal ever,this is really good and had not been able to find it for a long time
5.0,amazing tea!,"I am a no coffee, drink tea ALL the time person.  I have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones.  This has to be the most wonderful green tea out there!!  It is wonderful!!!"
1.0,"Worst tea I've even had, and can't return!","I'll echo another reviewer by saying that this tea is INDEED truly nasty.  Can't be returned, and the smell is so repugnant, I don't even want to use it for potpourri.  Because it had a few good reviews, I thought I'd give it a try.  Big mistake.  Perhaps I'll sprinkle it at the edge of the garden to keep away varmints this spring...."
5.0,Amazing!,"I fell in love with this spice while working for a Japanese restaurant during college, and have never looked back! I have used it for so many things, but my favorite way to eat it still remains sprinkled on jasmine rice. I love the flavor of it so much and putting it on a blank canvas such as rice really allows you to enjoy it's true deliciousness! Rice + a sprinkle of nanami togarashi + a sprinkle of soy = AMAZING!! Not too spicy (although I do enjoy spice) and even loved by my four year old! I went through the little bottles so often I invested in the large bag :-)"
1.0,broken bears,I thought giving chocolate bears would be great for the holidays but when they arrived half of the bears arrived broken or melted. The packaging was totally insufficient with only a plastic top on the bears. The candy was obviously not lovingly cared for and havoc reigned. Now I have nothing to give the kids. I would not order from this company again.
1.0,Very disapointed!,The description stated that this gum is naturally sweetened with Stevia. It said NOTHING about containing artificial sweetners (sugar alcohols). My digestive tract can not tolerate sugar alcohols (and I have Type II Diabetes so I do not chew regular gum). A case of this gum is expensive but I thought it would have been worth it (I love gum)if it was ONLY swwetened with Stevia. I feel duped!!!
5.0,Zero Bars,"Last of a dying breed!!  Originally made by the Hollywood Candy Company ([...]), now made by Hershey's.  These are similar to the original ones from my youth. Originally they sold for 5 cents. One of only two of the original offerings by Hollywood Candy, the other being the PayDay bar.  Currenty available in two sizes, 1.85 oz and 3.4 oz ""Supersize"".  Try them, you'll like them!"
1.0,Horrible artificial smoke flavor,"I was shocked and disgusted at the overwhelming, fake smoke flavor in these tomatoes. I missed the return window by 30 minutes, so I can't return them. Do not buy this product under any circumstance."
1.0,"Too Strong Ginger, with Lemon Tea","I'm not a connoisseur of tea or coffee.  I do like ginger bread, and ginger cookies.  Last year, I was on a ship and took ginger pills for sea sickness, and I was told not to chew them.  I thought since I liked ginger (as in bread and cookies) that I would like those pills, so I chewed them.  BAD idea.  Yuck. Terrible after taste.  Well, sorry to say, this ginger lemon beverage was nearly as bad (at least to me)."
1.0,Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts 215g,This is one big rip-off.  This little bag of all-sorts is about half the size of a cracker jacks box.  I guess it's my fault for not knowing how much 215grams is.  I get them locally for $2.79 a bag at Walgreens drug stores.  For some reason I thought this was a bigger bag.  They were $9.99.  If I could give this transaction zero stars I would..............
5.0,Siply the best onion soup dip mix,"This is the 'little secret' my mother uses on her famous clam dip. It is not as salty as other mixes nor as strongly oniony; it does not overpower the subtle clam flavor, but instead enhances it. You will be happily surprised when you don't reek with onion days afterward. Enjoy!"
1.0,MOLD MOLD MOLD MOLDY MOLDY MOLDY MOLDY! DONT BUY!,"First off, it was disgustingly difficult to tear the jerky with my teeth, unlike the other flavor, sweet and hot.  Then after LITERALLY 1 after week there was fuzzies on the jerky. You buy a 1 lb. bag so it lasts, right? I didn't realize what it was so I ate a little bit anyways. Then another week goes by - I'm talking about with the bag sealed completely up - and there is a crap ton of white and green mold all over the jerky.  They had it on sale because it expired 10 years ago.  OH AND YOU CAN'T GET A REFUND :P"
5.0,My View,I love strawberry flavor instant breakfast and cant find it in any local grocery store. Glad to find it online.
5.0,Yum! Yum!,"My 7-month old son loves Yummy Spoonfuls! Besides rice cereal, this is the only baby food he's ever eaten. I bought a jar of organic baby food at the grocery store, tried it myself, and it tasted nothing like real food, so I didn't want to feed it to him. I researched other options and found Yummy Spoonfuls (via Cookie Magazine). What a great variety of food for all stages, and it tastes like real food! My son has loved ALL of the veggies ... eats the whole amount every time! Mama and baby couldn't be happier with this product. And I love the fact that it's homemade organic food ... I really wanted to make my own food, but can't find the time or energy, and why should I when Yummy Spoonfuls does it all for me!?"
5.0,great snack,Finally!  A snack that tastes like a real snack & not trying to be another fake chip!  I love the cheddar & can't wait to try the new rosemary flavored smart fries!
5.0,Ambrosial treat appeases finnicky adults and children alike,"I've never had much of a sweet tooth and even I find these lollipops to be addictive.  They are not sickeningly or artificially sweet, there are no awful additives and food colourings, just fruit juice and sugar.  Best of all, it's organic.  There is a wide variety of piquant flavours, some more traditional (Strawberry Smash) and others more tropical (Mango Tango).  NB: I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that the bags definitely do not provide equal amounts of each flavour.  Luckily, none of them taste terrible but it is a legitimate niggle.  For the kids, this candy is especially practical due to its relatively small (read as exercise in moderation) size and you can give them a few without feeling like you're spoiling or depriving them.  As for the adults, the flavours are complex enough to keep you interested in a guilt-free indulgence.  Sure they cost a bit more than non-organic lollies but where else are you going to find gluten-free Kosher lollipops that taste this great?  Exactly.  So whether you're bribing your nieces and nephews into behaving or helping former smoker friends ease the pain of nicotine withdrawal, it's always good to have a bag of these on hand."
1.0,Not what they said it is,I purchased this tea because I was told that it helps with excess gas but this tea has made worsen my gas problem. I am very disappointed with the purchase
5.0,Simply Delicious!,"This is a great all-natural hot treat.  I drink it all the time, though I add a small squeeze of maple syrup to my cup of hot brew."
5.0,SAME AS DEFURR-UMS?  CLOSE ENOUGH!!!  BOTH EXCELLENT!!!,"This is a reformulated DEFURR-UMS HAIRBALL TREATS (reviewed separately).  The exact ingredients for comparison are hard to come by.  M&C does not list them on its website; luckily a few retail websites have an ""ingredients"" button that forces M&C to disclose the major ingredients to its otherwise ""proprietary"" recipe.  The new  concoction made quite a few changes (adding inulin for example and ?cranberry?) but the changes have not affected acceptability negatively (possibly improved it, judging by our pickiest cat who now accepts it). The only negative change is in the pricepoint ($8 vs $4) at which the new package is offered on Amazon; Petco stores have the new package on sale for $4. Until Amazon transfers the reviews under the phased-out version over to this new (and improved?) formula, you might want to take a look at the DEFURR-UMS evaluations and also my separate review of hairball remedies under PET NATURALS HAIRBALL. The HEALTHYBITES iteration is excellent (and I will update this review if its long-term performance proves negative) but my opinion of M&C customer service stands (""lousy""); maybe they loaned the service reps to the marketing department during the change in packaging from metallic to white and the switch in names from DEFURR-UMS to HEALTHYBITES. Personally, I liked the DEFURR-UMS tag; how could you do any better for a hairball remedy than DEFURR-UMS?"
5.0,Love this Gum,"This is by far my favorite gum. It lasts longer than other Trident flavors, but not very long (~30 minutes)"
1.0,Tupelo Honey (nasty),Did not care for the Tupelo honey. A fairly bitter taste for honey. Two of the bottles leaked in the package.
1.0,Toxic ingredients,Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K) is a severely toxic synthetic form of vitamin K (can cause severe liver damage) and Carrageenan as well. I would never feed my cat that food.
1.0,Bad taste stay away,This product is bad. I ordered 3 cases of this without knowing about it and it turned out to be the worst coconut water I ever tasted. The water was sour and every single person i know who tasted this didnt like it. Amazon gave me an amazing customer service by refunding me the entire purchase price. Except for amazon's customer service do not get this.
1.0,mint tea not minty,"i was really disappointed with this tea, because i expected mroe from loose leaf tea. my wife thinks it smells like marijuana, and i couldn't taste even a hint of mint. total waste of money"
5.0,Snacks,I like spicy snacks and this product fills the bill nicely. I will not buy another bag from the store after tasting these. A minute twenty seconds in the microwave and they are done. When my stash gets low I'll be buying more.
1.0,NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.  Smelled like garbage and tasted even worse. It went in the trash.
1.0,confirmation of # of packages,I really like this popcorn and decided to give them as gifts to friends and family.  Of course upon reading the review I was a little apprehensive.  Bottom line is this order contains ONLY 3 packages (11oz) of Zebra popcorn.  The 11 oz is considered regular size bags.  On the Popcornopolis website you can get 6 regular cones for $46.99.  The buyer should correct his advertisement as they are very confusing and misguiding.  I guess I was hoping it really was 6 packages but partly my fault for not contacting the buyer to make sure I understood what I was buying.
5.0,These are my absolute favorite!!!!,"These are very unique and oh SO GOOD! I only buy them on amazon, I try to resist because once they arrive I can't stop eating them! They have a great crunch, a typical kettle cooked chip, very thick with a great amount of salt and yes a slightly sweet vinegar taste. These are def malt vinegar, not white vinegar flavor. Absolutely the best, I can resist most chips but not these!"
1.0,WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN HYDROGINATED OILS AND STARCH,THIS IS A DANGEROUS PRODUCT TO PURCHASE IT HAS HYDROGINATED STARCH OR OILS AND IS VERY UNHEALTHY FOR THE BODY TO CONSUME.  IT IS NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION DUE TO THE HYDROGINATED OILS.  I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS AGAIN GOLITELY MUST CHANGE THEIR FORMULA IF CONSUMERS ARE TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
5.0,Crunchy good,"Excellent crunch. Very fresh. Big size bags. These are not exactly what you enjoy in Mexico, but they are very close. Great flavor. For anyone that has never had these or the ones in Mexico, they are in for a real treat. Just add to your super saver freight order and the price is well worth it."
5.0,overall experience,This is the second time I have ordered from this seller through Amazon.  Both experiences have been outstanding.  I also checked local prices for this product and they could not match the price I got on Amazon.  I ordered on Sunday and the product was delivered on Thursday.  I think that is just amazing.  Well packaged.  What more could you ask?
5.0,Andes Peppermint Crunch Chips,This product is hard to find in my area. I use these chips to add to bark. People at the church bazaar were looking for this and were disappointed because I couldn't locate the product. Then I realized I should have checked online. This vendor was almost sold out but I managed to get enough bags to get me through 2012 holiday baking season! I am so thankful to have found a vendor who could easily fill the order! I will defintely use them again!
5.0,great food for allergic dogs,"This food solved some ongoing allergy problems in my dogs....  I went Nature's Recipe for a few reasons 1- they never source from China, everything is USA, so I don't have to worry about things like the scare over poisonous Chinese protein that happened a few years back,,, 2- no by products... this is the only brand I've found that doesn't have a meat by product meal (by product means beaks, hooves, intestines and a long list of stuff that I would never feed to any animal, and has some proven harmful effects) 3- no corn or wheat...  a lot of dogs become allergic to corn and wheat over tie causing all kinds of health problems...  this is the only allergy food that Ive ever found that had no wheat or corn...  Great product"
5.0,"Incredibly fresh, flavorful coffee!","This coffee has been around for so long, that I've lost track of when it was first produced.  Originally a product of the old A&P grocery stores, it has LONG had a reputation of just very amazing coffee at a very reasonable price.  I am SO very glad that I found it again at our local Kroger store, and since they kept selling out of it, all of the other grocery stores around here decided to stock it as well.  Even the variety store that begins and ends with a t.  All that to say that we buy this whole bean exclusively, grind it by the pot every morning, and just sit back and enjoy that incredible aroma and flavor that we have for most of our lives.  Our parents, our grandparents, and their parents all enjoyed this coffee.  It's a very long family tradition, one that I certainly won't be breaking anytime soon.  Just an amazing cup of coffee, EVERY time.  Highly, highly, highly recommend!"
1.0,Avoid This Product,"If you enjoy Virginia peanuts, then this is not for you. The nuts are small, broken the majority of times and just not good. These are clearly 'seconds' that they would not include in their regular product. If you want a quality product, skip Virginia Diner and buy Royal Oak or The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg products."
1.0,Leaves and worms,"To start with, I'm a big fan of goji berries. A friend recommended another brand that I faithfully purchased until it was no longer available. I just found out it's name and packaging have changed and I've placed my order! In the interim, I purchased the Navitas brand and have been disappointed. There were a number of green and dried leaves in the bag, which I never experienced with the ""other"" brand. I was about two-thirds of the way through my current bag when I discovered a couple of lovely little worms floating in my tea! FYI, I usually start my morning off with a big cup of hot tea, sweetened with gojis. After seeing the additional protein in my tea I decided to check the remaining contents of the bag. I emptied it out onto a white paper towel and discovered a number of more white worms. The bag has been kept sealed and stored in a dry, cool area so I blame the product not how it was stored. I'm very disappointed and will not be purchasing any more products from this company."
5.0,Yum!,This is so good in smoothies and as a fruit dip. So much better than eating all the fat and sugar in regular peanut butter. I should have ordered two jars.
5.0,Adolph's Beef Stew Mix,"Have used this product for a few years for seasoning roast beef in roaster.  We enjoy the taste.  The stores in our area quit selling this, so I went online.  We bought 16 packs and will buy more if we run out.  Tried other brands, but did not like the taste as well."
1.0,Overpriced,"I should've done my research first. Basically over a $1 per jar. I can get a WAY better deal by going to the store. Total ripoff!  I will continue to buy Beech Nut, just not from this person."
5.0,fantastic for weight loss,I have been having this product for lunch 5 times per week over the last six months and it it has contributed to my loosing 50 pds.
5.0,My picky dog loves it!,"I have a Shih Tzu who is a very picky eater.  And I mean picky.  He will only eat certain treats, certain dog food and even certain table foods (I know, technically you are not suppose to feed table foods, but we do).  He LOVES Beneful dog food!!  It is, by far his preferred food - even over the more expensive brands.  We also have two large outside dogs - a Newfoundland and a mix breed who both gobble this stuff up like no tomorrow.  The soft chewy chunks add a nice combination for the dogs to enjoy, I think, and the flavor seems to appeal to them greatly.  The bag does state that it is made with real beef, however beef is like the 8th ingredient listed, so I am not sure exactly how much real beef is in the food.  Otherwise it does seem to be very healthy as all our dogs are very active, vital and healthy with shiny coats.  As a pet owner, I feel confident feeding this to my dogs as well. The ingredients are good - though,granted, not the best - ground yellow corn and chicken by-product meal being the first two in the ingredient list, but with table scraps they get enough real meat.  The price is reasonable and (I know, this should technically hold no bearing, but is something that I love) the zip close bag is wonderful.  Beneful is a dog food that we will be using for years and one that I highly recommend dog owners to try, if they haven't already!"
1.0,WARNING OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST!!!,"Buyers Beware, 1 lb. of Marzipan for $4.99.. Sounds great, right? What they neglect to tell you is that there is an additional $9 shipping charge!!!!!! Insane. If this company *ever* thinks they will get another dime from me, they are sorely mistaken. I placed my order along with some books, and Amazon does not itemize the shipping charges, only gives you one lump sum for all the items you order... At *no point* does Amazon or the company tell you what the shipping is for this item, unless it is the only item you order, and then only right before the final checkout. It was only after paying, when I received itemized email invoices that I was informed of the $9 shipping charge. What an incredibly shortsighted business practice. 1 lb Marzipan, for $16. No thank you."
1.0,"Buy at store, if you must buy at all...","First off - these don't ship well.  When I recieved my package (even though it was clearly sealed and had not been opened) it looked like there were several cookies missing, there was a lot of empty space in the package allowing the cookies that were in there to slide all over, and several were broken as a result.  If you really REALLY want to try these, I would look for them at the local store rather than buy online and have them shipped.  That being said....I'm awfully glad I didn't actually pay for these.  I've never been a fan of Chips Ahoy cookies - even as a kid.  They're just so over-processed and artificial tasting.  I was hoping the extra blob of fudge in these might help make up for that, but not really.  I can't justify buying awful-tasting cookies when it's not that difficult to make your own, or even to buy from a local bakery which tastes a million times better and fresher.  I cannot recommend these - they were not packaged well, and did not taste any better than I expected."
1.0,"Brown, not yellow or gold","Well, I should have read the reviews because these are definitely not the bright yellow color as pictured.  They are a brownish yellow color and will be returned asap."
1.0,"Not whitening, ok",Would rather have the whitening gum. Falls apart when chewing I do not like it at all. Love the Harder Pieces Yummy on those!
5.0,Works well!,"Every spring we get little black ants in the home.  It's like a mini invasion in a couple of locations around the house.  Our first invasion this year came to my bathroom, and it wasn't a huge problem.  I'd squish 30-50 ants per day, and really, my main complaint is that I don't like little insects crawling on my stuff.  They're small, but they aren't clean, and there are lots of 'em!  This product stopped the current invasion completely within three days.  When Hot Shot arrived on Wednesday, I placed a two-inch bead of gel along the crack they seemed to be using, wiped up a little residue, and found that the following day I only squished three ants, the next day squished one or two, and today I haven't seen any.  The product may not work as well for all types of ant and insect problems, but for my situation, it's been perfect.  I hope the active ingredients are stable, because for my use, the amount of bait provided will last a lifetime."
1.0,WARNING***COCA LEAF TEA WILL SHOW POSITIVE FOR COCAINE IN DRUG TEST***,"My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that ""coca leaf"" is a schedule II substance and illegal.  [...]  DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.  If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court. If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com."
1.0,save your money,My two dogs showed absolutely no interest in the pee post. I think I would have gotten better results if I left a ten dollar bill out there for them to pee on!
5.0,Taste great!,These taste great! We can hardly keep them in the house more than a week. The flavor is great! Yummy!
5.0,Mellow/Yummy & Easy,"Not like a typical instant or canned soup -- very much like served in a restaurant. Has a nice body/texture although this is a broth and therefore thin. Also it is a subtle/mild flavor, so might not be for everyone.  Using the 8-oz hot water and a touch of soy sauce (I'm a salt-loving person -- you might not want it), I find it perfect. Have served it to company with openness and no apologies for it being instant. I like to make food from scratch, but not every course every time, so this is a welcome addition to my pantry. And a pleasant in-between meal snack."
5.0,The best thing in the world for my son!,"My son is allergic to wheat, corn, oats and rice. It is soooo hard to find anything that is Gluten Free and does not contain rice. So I was ecstatic to find this and immediately went home and made peanut butter cookies. They turned out great. I admit they have a bit of an aftertaste but it did not deter me from eating four cookies. My son loved them, and he is very picky. Even my daughter loved them and she can have regular grains. The recipes on the [...] website were very helpful too."
5.0,BEST formula--too bad not offered as a subscribe and save!!!,"When I stopped breast feeding, I did a lot of research on what formula is best for my baby....and I found EB!!!  I appreciate it not only being organic but also free of genetically modified ingredients!  I just wish Amazon offered the ""bonus 20% more cans"" as a subscribe and save item.  They (the pack of 4 bonus cans) are cheaper than the single, regular cans (which ARE eligible for subscribe and save) so I just have to remind myself to re-order when getting low.  Worth the savings, though!!!"
1.0,Disappointed also,"We bought this for our Paramount 6 oz popper. We were disappointed by the taste. We've been using LouAna Coconut oil (~[..] from Walmart for 31.5 fl.oz.), Act II popcorn salt and O.R. kernels. After the first mouthfuls of Great Northern Popcorn, people were pushing their bowls aside---it tasted like salted cardboard. Never again---so disappointed."
5.0,Taste good!,"The thing with rubs is if they don't taste good out of the bottle, well don't use it.  Most rubs arn't much more than cheap spice and lots of salt.  These rubs all have a different taste and they all taste good!  I use them as seasoning on all kinds of food. They are more than just salty color."
5.0,My dog loves it,"My dog loves this food and I don't have to worry about what's in it. With all of the bad dog food on the market, I'm glad there is a product like this one."
1.0,Flaxseed safety unknown,"It's amazing people love this product that is made of flaxseed particularly for pregnant women. Do some research on flaxseed, it is recommended that you avoid it during pregnancy."
1.0,Bad coffee,Worst coffee I have ever bought! No flavor. No aroma. I had to throw it away it was so bad.
5.0,NANTUCKEY BLEND ALL AROUND GREAT,"Received samples of this with my new K pot.  Have been purchasing it for over a year as the standby for guests and my husband.  It is medium roast(no burnt taste), but full of flavor.  Will keep purchasing it. Green Mountain Coffee Keurig Nantucket Blend (Medium Roast) (80 K-cups) "
5.0,The Best Oatmeal Flour,"For those with Celiac disease or anyone for that matter, this flour is excellent. It is certified gluten free and does not raise your ttG. Only .07% of celiac's will react to avenin in oats. I am convinced that it is still cross contamination from non-dedicated facilities where people say they react to oats or there are other reasons for reactivity. You can use this flour in any recipe you would use a wheat or other flour. The approximate ratio is 1 1/3 of oatmeal flour to 1 cup of wheat. Experiment for the consistency you need. It will also absorb a bit more liquid than wheat flour. You MUST add 1 tsp. xantham gum per 3 cups of oat flour as a binder. Oat flour makes superior pancakes, waffles, shortcake, cookies, I could go on and on. Again, just  substitute as above with xantham gum and you won't be disappointed. Don't waste your time on those breads and cookies at the store that are expensive, fall apart and taste like sand.  Thank you Bob's Red MIll."
5.0,I'm hooked and addicted.........,"You don't have to be dutch to love this licorice. I was born in Holland so I'm well acquinted with the different kinds of products that's available. I'm sold on Gustaf's Traditional Licorice. Not mentioning how many others I have won over by letting them try it, I am truely an advocate for this product and decided to be on the automatic reorder program. Do your research licorice is good for the body."
5.0,best vita coco flavor,"if you like coconut water and acai and pomegranate, you will love this. although the taste of the coconut water is barely noticed mixed with the stronger tasting acai, you definetely feel the benefits of the rehydration and acai. i drink after yoga and feel pretty great quickly after. i still love eating sambazon frozen acai mixed with granola and bananas, but this is how i drink my acai now."
5.0,A beautiful oil,"I bought this oil as a part of a Christmas present for my father. I had been looking for a vinegar sampler, and came up empty. So I bought 3 vinegars and this oil from the same vendor thinking I could get a break on shipping. It wasn't to be - each of my gifts had shipping costs almost as high as the cost of the product. It all worked out as my father genuinely loved the oil and the vinegars."
1.0,Lemon Lime - or nasty medicine?,"I did NOT like this lemon lime flavor.  It made me gag.  It tastes like some kind of horrible medicine.  The diet Cranberry was drinkable, I can tell how other people would like it but it was not my favorite.  Dr. Pete is great!  I have yet to try any other flavors.  I have made my own syrups to use with it instead."
5.0,OMG,I really an not a big candy consumer HOWEVER these little puppies are truly amazing! Dangerously so. Just about the best discovery I've made this year! The only problem is they are never in stock!!!! If you can manage getting a bag you'll wish you bought more. Condensed milk in the creamiest hard candy I've ever had!
1.0,Bitter tasting coffee,This coffee has a really bitter taste and leaves a really bad after taste. I would not recommend this coffee at all.  The only good kcups are Green Mountain the Columbian is superb.
5.0,An Indian delight!,"For all those Indians who are staying away from home and miss the food their mom's cook, this dish can bring a smile to your face. Spicy and delicious. One of the better MTR dishes out there."
1.0,"Superior Touch, Please advise if there is ANY MSG in your product","I have been using the Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base for years.  I was in the process of ordering additional jars, when I read Ms Hill's comment, from December, 2008.  I reviewed the Ingredients listed on the jar and researched yeast extract and maltodextrin. There are very good articles on line, that explain how MSG can be ""hidden"", in the list of ingredients.  The articles indicate there are over 40 food ingredients besides ""monosodium glutamate"" that contain processed free glutamic acid (MSG). It appears that autolyzed yeast extract and maltodextrin are two of those food ingredients.  In addition, ""NO MSG ADDED"" does not mean that there is NO MSG in the product. If MSG is ""processed into"" a product as opposed to being ""poured into"" a product (just a matter of a different processing method), then a company can declare ""NO MSG ADDED""  or ""NO ADDED MSG"", even though the product contains MSG. Therefore, before I make an additional purchase,  I am asking Superior Touch --- Please advise if your Better Than Bouillon products actually contain any MSG."
1.0,Terrible,The Easter Bunny I received looked nothing like the picture. It was white and chalky. I looks like it was last years bunny they decided to recycle this year.
1.0,Items were spoiled/faulty,The initial shipment of treats were spoiled - the sweet potato was moldy inside the bag. Requested replacement and they were the same. Obviously these have been stored somewhere unsuitable and they were ruined. Have given up trying to convey this to Amazon as they obviously don't get it...
1.0,You are only getting one container!,"I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz. container, and I assumed it was at least 2-3 containers since the cost was over $8."
5.0,Yummy!,"I use this in place of bouillon.  It is fantastic!  I even use it as a rub on meats.  Also, it works really nicely to make homemade cream of chicken soup.  We LOVE it!  We keep it stocked up in our house all the time."
5.0,GOLIGHTLY Sugar-Free  Just Chocolates Hard Candy,"These sugarless candies have wonderful, true chocolate taste with no nasty aftertaste.  Very refreshing and satisfying.  I highly recommend these to anyone who wants something sweet without sugar, like myself."
5.0,"Wow, Absolutely Incredible","So my 4 1/2 month old Yellow Lab is going through his teething and chewing phase where everything is fair game. I lost a pair of $100 sunglasses, 3 books and a pair of running shoes before looking for an alternative and this bone was my first choice. HE LOVES IT!!!! he doesn't chew anything else anymore. It took his puppy stomach a few days to get use to it but now he happily lays at my feet and gnaws away. I would highly recommend this product and just remind people that dogs stomachs are way more sensitive than ours and might just take a few days to get use to it, but don't give up!"
5.0,best drink ever,I like this drink because of the taste. I like pepsi of any kind.I always burp after this drink but it gives me a lot of energy. I recommend it but it is not healthy.
1.0,Natural Balance Dry Cat Food,"Don't buy this product.  Company would like you to think it is healthy, but it isn't.  Made my cat sick, throwing up.  Now I find out it is made by Diamond Foods and is in the recall list just anounced 5/30/2012.  Diamond Foods makes alot of pet food products and has a very poor rating for safe products.  They had to shut down 3 of their plants because of contamination.  I had to throw this product away, and it cost over $30.00.  Save the money and don't buy this crap!!!"
1.0,YUCK!,I got this product today. The product is bad. As in spoiled. Ruined my morning too. Spoiled half and half makes your coffee taste pretty nasty
5.0,Great Flavor,Really nice salt but it did not last long. Hawaiian sea salts higher price is all that keeps me from getting it more often.
5.0,"Great product, bad price","Dr. Schar's bread is delicious, especially since they upgraded the texture.  I understand that they are now building a baking facility in the US - I guess most of their products, if not all, were coming from Europe. ??? What I don't like are the prices being charged online.  If one of our somewhat local Walmarts have the bread, it is about $5+.  I think there is another supermarket that carries it for about the same price.  Online prices can be as much as $7.50/loaf.  Ridiculous!  A lot of us who must eat GF food are also dealing with major medical costs associated with the diseases that force us to go GF.  I will never pay the exorbitant prices."
1.0,TERRIBLE OLD MELTED,THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED MELTED TOGETHER LIKE IT WAS SITTING IN HOT WAREHOUSE FOR A YEAR.
5.0,Excellent cookies alternative,"Nabisco has done it again with this great new product. It is not exactly a cookie, and it is not exactly a cracker, but something in between.  These Fruit Thins are called crispy cookies on the packaging, and they are crisp enough to seem like a cracker, but they are not dry like a cracker. They have a wonderful fruitiness about them. I had the blueberry and bown sugar version, and they had real pieces of chewy blueberry in the cookies.  They are not heavy like some rich desserts, but have a rich flavor. I like that they are made with unbleached flour, which gives the cookies a warm brown color. I especially love them with hot tea; my husband likes his with coffee. These Fruit Thins make a great snack or a light after dinner dessert.  Three cookies are only 140 calories, with 5 grams of fat, only 90 sodium, and only 8 sugar grams.  The packaging is nice in that the cookies are not loose in the bag but set in a plastic tray. Now I know that environmentally, this is extra packaging, but I like the tray because it keeps the cookies from getting crushed in transport/shipping.  Overall, this is an excellent snack or dessert."
5.0,Love em!,This is the only trail mix I have found that does not contain any tree nuts (I have allergies to them). This mix is very delicious and filling.
1.0,Yet more false advertising,"I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.  This chocolate has no flavor of bat in any way shape or form.  I did a review of the chocolate from the same company with the chimpanzee on the label, and noted no flavor of chimp in it.  I was forced to give it a one star review, but did try to be fair and say the chocolate itself, if it was sold as JUST chocolate was fine.  Now they continue this trend of such false labelling and have no bat flavor in this chocolate.  What gives?  Yes, as chocolate it's fine, much like the so called chimpanzee flavored bar I tried earlier this year, so consider this a four or five star review if the lack of bat flavor doesn't bother you.  But doesn't a chocolate bar with let's say raspberries on the label contain a raspberry extract, jelly or something else with raspberry flavor?  Why wouldn't one with a bat on the label contain no bat flavor?  I may try the other chocolates by this company, I'm curious to see if the one with the panther on the label does taste at least like some sort of cat, if not an actual panther.  But I am disappointed yet again by this company.  If you're going to claim to flavor your chocolate to taste like animals, include the animal flavor!"
5.0,Great!,The color is intense. You just need a little bit to achieved the intense red color that you like. I am using it for my red velvet cake. Good product. Good food coloring. I will buy more with this brand.
5.0,Delicious!,I personally have found Udi's gluten free granola to be best gf granola available.  I love the different flavors/textures available.  It's not gritty or too sugary.  It's a well balanced blend of flavors and textures and is healthy to boot!
5.0,A great alternative to K-Cups,"Yup not a K-Cup. If you don't like the non-plastic cup, then don't buy them.  For our family, we like the taste, and the price. We've tried both this French Roast and the Fogchaser, and enjoy them both. We have not had any issues with grounds in the coffee. We keep them in a zip-lock bag after opening the 12 pack bag, so we have not had issues with them tasting stale (we drink them in about 2-weeks). I'm guessing that these cost less since they don't have to pay a royalty to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for using the K-Cup name and design.  If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive alternative to the K-Cup, these are a great choice!"
1.0,Big bag of awful candy. Horrible.,"I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had. I should have known, seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup. Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you."
1.0,Walden Farms Alfredo Sauce,"This was terrible! Don't buy it. I would rather eat air! I can't even describe how it tasted. If I could give it zero stars, I would have. There was not much flavor. Just sort of pepper with water and flour taste. I could have done a better job with a little seasoning some powdered milk and water."
1.0,not as described,the jelly beans came in a flimmsy plastic baggie with tape/it did not come in a container as described/not sanitary at all gross
5.0,Favorite Kashi product,"Of all Kashi's products, this is our favorite.  We mix it with plain yogurt and a little fruit-only jelly for a healthy dessert.  My only advice is to keep in an air-tight container because it does tend to clump together and get hard if left in the original package too long."
5.0,family tradition,"I was raised in rural  Berks County, PA and Cope's Corn was a part of our Thanksgiving and Christmas tradition as long as I can remember. It is a tradition my daughters and I continue today. Always a surprising culinary success, we have spread the nutty taste of Cope's Corn to IL, MT, MA, VT, VA, NC and as far away as Alaska. Last fall a New York Times food section mention of the delights of Cope's Corn brought a smile to my face. Healthy and easy to make, it is a treasure from America's past  Cope's Dried Corn 7.5 oz - 6 Unit Pack ."
1.0,old product,i ordered a lot of this licorice but i am so disappointed that they are very old and hard i wanted to return them and get my money back but i just found out i can not return them i am so upset and i want to get my money back.
5.0,training treats,Bailey love these.  They are small and easy to break apart for small rewards in training.Bag closes easily to keep moist.
5.0,We love Happy Tot!,"My 17 month old boy loves these, I don't give him as much of these as I used to since he is now into table food more than purees, but I would mix half of this in his oatmeal in the morning or if we are out, I'll use these as a snack or dessert. They are a good handy pouch to throw in your diaper bag and can sit there for days, if not weeks! I love all the ingredients in this one, baby seems to enjoy it too!"
1.0,Money Savings Advise!!!,"Just save your money and time, and just don't buy. The pictured jar of filled to the rim gumballs was not what arrived in the mail. The jar I received was filled just above the Dubble Bubble Gumball sticker. This distortion of the truth has led me to doubt my beliefs, that a picture is worth a thousands words. Don't get me wrong, it was a 53oz jar, but half full is half full. I plan to take the advise of other viewers and take my business to Wal-mart. I would advise others to do the same, especially when reputable companies use misleading photos to swindle us out of our hard earned money. And for the record, if there was a way to rate this less than one star, I would rate it a negative ten."
5.0,The BEST oyster sauce available!,"This is by far the BEST oyster sauce available for authentic Asian cooking, hands down. Get this local, it is WAY cheaper, should only be 2-4 bucks a large bottle.  I run out of oyster sauce frequently. If you like to cook Asian foods, get this!"
5.0,Wonderful treat for great price,My dog loves this all natural treat and the price cannot be beat by any store.
5.0,Better Than Expected,"I was kind of hesitant to order Nick's Sticks after reading about how they don't exactly taste ""right"", however I am very pleased I did. These grass fed beef sticks actually taste better than your tradition Slim Jim type meat sticks. Everyone of course is entitled to their own preference. Therefore if you are accustomed to the drugstore brand type of meat jerkey's or sticks, then you may find Nick's Stick's a little off putting. These taste natural with no nitrites, msg or preservative like artificial tastes that you typically get with a lot of other dried meat snacks. And contrary to what the other reviewer said, you can definitely taste the sea salt in this, maybe not much of the other herbs but it's okay because I like my flavor a little bit stripped down to the essentials and not covered up with different flavors that overlap one another"
5.0,Chocolate lovers heaven,"Eat slowly, let small bites melt on your tongue. You will get different flavors and tastes. Although expensive, you don't need to eat a lot to satisfy your chocolate craving. I can take 4 days for 1 3 oz bar. Certainly as good as any Belgian or Swiss chocolates I bought in Europe from gourmet chocolate stores. Sadly, not well known in the US.  The original company was bought by Hershey a few years ago, but does not advertise Sharffen Berger as much as their other candies. Which is surprising, given that this is so much better than the Hershey bars, kisses, etc  for eating or cooking. So buy a bar, taste a bit of chocolate heaven. BTW, this is specifically for the dark chocolate, but their bittersweet is also excellent. I don't eat milk chocolate any more, but my daughter loves their milk chocolate, says its the best, and she has sampled a lot of chocolate."
5.0,Nutritious and fun-to-use,"I admit... I picked these from the Vine list entirely because of curiosity.  Chia seeds?  What the heck are those?  I'll let the prospective customer do the research on the details, but all I figure you need to know is that they are tiny seeds that are extremely nutritious with many different purposes.  Mainly so far I have been using them as an egg substitute and a little something to throw into soups, yogurt, whatever is cooking that wouldn't be opposed to some seeds.  They have no strong taste, but add some great texture and apparently amazing nutrition.  As an egg substitute? This is the only one I have tried that WORKS.  I'm searching for new ways to use them, but even in my so-far limited experience I am highly impressed."
1.0,Not the same,"This is definitely not the same. I absolutely loved the vanilla as a young person.  I was sooo happy to discover they were making it again. But one bite and I was very disappointed. Not hard at all like it used to be, not even close to the same flavor and felt grainy.  I know that sometimes you remember things differently than they actually were, but this was way too different. Very disappointed."
1.0,too beady,"i didn't like this product at all and ended up tossing it. the soft inner part of the candy tasted really good but the hard, beady outer part was a headache. i ended up having to peel/scrape all the outer beady thingies off the candies just to get to the soft, jelly/gummy part of the candy. in the end it was just not worth the effort so i took it as a loss and threw it all away. since every person is an individual and has their own tastes, if you want to give it a try go for it. as for me and my opinion, i didn't like these candies at all as long as those outer beady thingies were on them. by-the-way, the beady thingies had no raspberry fruity taste to them, only the inner gummy part had flavor. the beady parts just had a sweet, flavorless taste."
5.0,amazing!,Very good taste and texture. So yummy on the lot a dots cake. Very delicious. and very easy to make. Love them both!
5.0,"Mmmmmm, Good!","My wife is from Europe (Russia mainly, but she's also lived in England) and she claims that European candies are better than American candies. She says that European candies are less sweet and more flavorful. From the ones I've tried, I'd have to agree. Funny, I'd never thought about it before. In any case, we live not to far from a Fresh and Easy market. It's a British company and they have a lot of British things, including candies. I've had several varieties of Cadbury chocolate things that were just extraordinary. As such, this evening I picked up a Cadbury Flake Bar. Mmmmmm, Gooood! That''s just delicious! It's not too sweet and has a nice rich cocoa/chocolate taste. My goodness! These are excellent!  Gary Peterson"
1.0,Chinese Truffles,I was incredibly disappointed.  I used an entire jar and the product still did not have any taste.  I won't be buying again.
5.0,The best,Super coffee that make having a Senseo finally worth while. Great customer service as well. The best seller of pods !
5.0,Delicious!,"I used to live in Germany for many years. I miss the taste of good German cooking. Even if you don't read German, the directions are pretty easy to understand through the pictures. Mushrooms do not come in the packet. You will need to buy and slice about 1/4 pound of fresh or a small can. First, I fried some chicken. After removing the meat from the pan I added 1/2 stick butter. If I didn't have the drippings, I would have used a whole stick. In addition to mushrooms, I added sliced onions. Saute the vegetables in the butter. Add the water, then the sauce packet. Stir with a whisk or spatula until the sauce thickens, which is fairly quickly. Remove from the heat and let the sauce set for few minutes to continue thickening. I served this with Thai jasmine rice. I will try adding bell peppers the next time for a colorful variety. In German restaurants this is usually served with pan-fried pork cutlets. You can eat this with any meat cooked any way you like. Or, no meat at all, just rice or potatoes. If you are watching your fat intake, this may not be a good sauce for you unless you substitute the butter for a cholestrol-free margerine or spread. I prefer I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. Good luck and enjoy!"
5.0,"the best on the market, impossible to find","This is the original raisin bran; none compare.  It is not sweetened...YEA!  It stays crunchy in milk...YEA!  Do not try to compare it to the raisin bran found on most grocery store shelves; it is a different ""animal"".  This is nuttier, heartier and not sweet.  It is closer to the earth, with less processing, less of a carbon footprint.  It is a squished wheat berry; you can tell by looking at it!  The wheat berry is steamed, flattened and baked.  You can't get more ""whole-grain"" than that.  Wheat products can be of concern, but for me, not this one.  I wish it were still sold in southern California."
5.0,Yumm! Mother's Cookies!,These cookies were delivered in good time and in great condition. Very fresh. Very yummy! Glad for Amazon since we can't purchase these wonderful goodies locally.
5.0,Simply delicious!,Outstanding product...I am always going to have them around.  Far and above most crackers for taste and good nutrition.
1.0,Cats are not thrilled with this ball,My three Turkish Angoras are normally very playful animals.  They just sit on the sofa and watch this ball on the floor.  It does not seem to stimulate them in the slightest.  They have not played with this ball once in that last 2 years.  I would not purchase this product again.
1.0,DISGUSTING !!!!!!,"WARNING, WARNING, WARNING....DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!!! THE BOX ARRIVED CRUSHED IN ONE CORNER, UPON OPENING, THE CHOCOLATE WAS OLD AND WHITE, NO (ZERO) LIQUID CENTERS, AND THE CHERRIES WERE AS HARD AS ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  DISGUSTING AND VERY, VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!!!!!"
5.0,can't stop!,"these candies are great tasting & organic. i can't stop eating them! everyone i offered them to, loved them!"
1.0,dont like the taste,I am not a big fan of pav bhaji but this tastes worse of all the pav bhajis I ate
1.0,"Bitter Ginger, No Lemon...","Obviously everyone's tastes are different, so just because I didn't like this doesn't mean you won't. I tried this hot and was only able to get through a couple sips. I tasted no lemon whatsoever, and the ginger was totally overpowering and bitter. As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a lemony golden color in your cup, as shown on the package...it's a dark swampy color. Like coffee with a lot of milk in it. I guess I was hoping for a light gingery lemon flavor that would be soothing, but this was far from it. I'm always on the hunt for new teas other warm beverages, so I'm glad I got to try this. Unfortunately it just wasn't for me."
5.0,Next best thing to being there....,Seasoning was very tasty and met my expectations. Looking forward to cooking with it very soon. Great change of pace for grilled veggies and chicken.
1.0,Better than dog food? Maybe!,These quickly became dog treats!  Just nasty!  I don't even know how they can sell these for human comsumption!  Stay away!
1.0,Caution - poorly balanced nutrition!,"Sojo's diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium/phosphorous additive to be safe."
1.0,Deflating Top,"I made this bread and the European Cheese and Herb bread.  I have a new Cuisinart Bread Maker, and the Cheese & Herb bread has always turned out gorgeous and yummy!  The Whole Wheat, however, flops!  See the photos.  Every loaf turned out this way......"
1.0,A mess delivered and not what promised,"This was a present for my Mom for Christmas.  Although we were at first happy because it showed up before Christmas when it said that it would be after, we were very disappointed on what was delivered.  My Mom said that the dirt was all over, even though it was shrink wrapped.  When she found the fisherman, she said it was so small that she didn't know what it was at first.  He was not holding a fishing pole, and she couldn't figure out where he went since she found him hidden in the dirt.  She had to balance the tree against the rocks, otherwise it would fall over.  On a positive note, the seller was quick to respond for our refund."
1.0,Contains genetically modified ingredients!,I recently found out that Special K and ALL other Kelloggs products contain genetically modified corn. The pesticide found in GMO corn has been found in the blood of 93% of pregnant women and 80% of their unborn babies in a recent study. I will never eat a single spoonful of Special K again. Unless of course Kelloggs decides to change its ingredients to non-gmo like it has done in Europe where GMOs are banned!
1.0,Not sure if this is the right stuff,"We are major Ah-Choo disciples, and have been using it for several months now on our toddlers.  Unfortunately, the couple of Ah-Choo!s that were sent to us seem fake.  I actually smell Vaseline more than anything else.  I can barely smell the eucalyptus.  What I liked about Ah-Choo! is that just by sniffing it, I felt calmer and my nostrils felt clearer.  My son always used to sleep better with the Ah-Choo! rubbed on chest.  We always purchased our Ah-Choo!s from our local organic supermarket, but they had no more of it so we resorted to purchasing it from Amazon.  I feel absolutely nothing from what was sent to me, and my son remains congested.  Have they changed the formula of Ah-Choo?  (Companies, I know, do that all the time.)  Or, is what was sent to me fake?  Well, we are disappointed in the product now."
5.0,awesome jerky,"I have ate this jerky at a local bar I go to so I was happy I could buy it online and have some at my own house. Awesome flavor. Love it, love it, love it."
1.0,price increase,"I have been ordering this at a lower price and now they increase the price.  I won't be ordering through here anymore, it is cheaper to go to the store."
5.0,great cereal,"I really like this cereal a lot..it's organic, has one ingredient, is tasty and stays crunchy in almond milk.  I eat it all the time and add some fresh fruit (blueberries or strawberries) and have a great, quick breakfast!"
5.0,Variety of items - Packaged nicely,I sent this as a gift to my mom....She said that she liked the variety of items....She also told me that she was going to keep the boxes to use in the future when she needed to package gifts....
1.0,Practically expired coffee,Ordered nine bags of coffee only to find it is best used in less than a month. NOT COOL. Received it feb  27 and it is best used by march 24 th. just ridiculous.
1.0,No information,How can I possibly order this to review it if I have no information?  Four jars of mixed spices?  What kinds of mix?  Leftovers?  Four pigs in a poke?  What in the world are you offering?
1.0,Should be able to see the ingredient list before buying,"I purchased this product to use in baked goods for my son who has allergies to dairy, soy, eggs and corn.  He drinks rice milk as his normal beverage with no problems at all.  Unfortunately, the ingredients in the powdered version contain both corn and soy products.  Unfortunately, since this is a food item, it is non-returnable, so it was a waste of money."
1.0,Cat refuses to eat this food!,"I was really excited to find a grain free food that was fairly affordable. Unfortunately, my cat will not touch this stuff! In fact my other cat that does not have grain issues won't eat it either. I think some of it has to do with the fairly large, square shape of the kibble. It is almost like dog food. Other than that it is the taste. The only way I can get my cat to eat this food is to put it through the food processor to break up the large pieces and douse it with water to make it seem like wet food. (My cat has always eaten dry food so it is not a dry/wet issue). By the way, although this food says it is grain free, it does still have grain in its ingredients. This is really deceiving and I am not sure why they are able to label this food as grain free. This purchase was a total waste of money and I will look for another brand and hope that my cat will eat it without the need to doctor it."
5.0,it's still great,"I've been eating Fri Chik for over 30 years.  This low fat version is not much different in taste.  I fry it in a flour mixture and spices that I like, soul flavor, garlic, onion.  I use the liquid with added water to make a simple gravy from an envelope mix, a few boiled potatoes, veggie , salad... whatever.  perfect meal.  When I was younger, my family used Fri Chik along with the canned vegetarian burger to form a mock turkey loaf for holidays.  I also love to eat the Fri Chik straight out of the can."
5.0,Healthy rice krispie treat!,My son is almost two and he loves these!  I used to get them in Target but can't find them anymore.  Toys R Us carries them but they are cheaper here.  These have the texture of a rice krispie treat only these are good for kids!  They're made with yogurt instead of all that marshmallow and butter.  They're not extra sticky like I expected them to be either. Lots of good nutrition in them too.
1.0,light tonic water,"I meant to order regular tonic water, so not what i expected. Trying to find Sweppes(sp) indian tonic water. I can't find in the states."
1.0,"Very Good Product, Very Bad Seller!","A really good product according to my MIL, she is using it as a flavoring in most dishes. However, be careful, do not add salt as usual to your dish while cooking when using this product, otherwise your dish will be salty.  I wish I could say such nice things about Otto's Hungarian Import Store & Deli too. After I posted my bad review of their lack of customer service and that I had to get my money back through my credit card company because they refused to give me credit for the spoiled items they shipped to me, they sent me numerous threatening e-mails and they even threatened to ""pay me back"" by posting bad things about my company on various message boards! (They never have done business with my company.) The situation got so bad I eventually had to have their e-mail address blocked on my server. Just a fair warning to those who are thinking of ordering from Otto's Hungarian Import Store & Deli."
5.0,Tastes great!,Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!
1.0,manhattan candies,I should have sent these back. Thay were stale with the chocolate coating on the jelly rings white and looked like they were in storage for a long time. The jelly inside was hard and inedible. Never again do I buy from this company. I was embarassed to serve them and threw out.
5.0,honey bunches of oats,"This cereal is amazingly good and I received four boxes and it lasted awhile, but everyone loves it so much!  Love, love, love this cereal and it was delived when they said and in great shape. thank you!"
1.0,Beware!,"Just today received a case (24 6 oz. cans) of Natural Balance Venison & Green Pea cat food. The cans wouldn't stack properly in the cupboard. On closer examination, we realized the tops of the cans were puffed up. The cat food is rotten. The carton said good till March 18, 2015. If you buy this food, take a close look at the tops so you don't use the food & make your cats deathly ill."
5.0,excellent,"expensive delicate oil/to be used sparingly on salad or a simple taste enhancement. a small amount on fried eggs is perfect with the wild pepper berries this same company offers,"
1.0,Vegans Beware: Has Sugar,"This item is listed as vegan, but the list of ingredients is not visible in the image, and the ingredients is not listed on Amazon. I contacted the company to send me the information on a few sauces. They have sugar in them, though they are labelled vegan. The company rep wrote that, ""All of the sauces you are interested are vegan, it contains no dairy product, meat or seafood. However, all cooking sauces contain sugar."" This is obviously a contradiction to many, if not most vegans.  I write this as an FYI to those wanting to find a vegan sauce. My daughter just turned vegan and needs an stir fry sauce without sugar or with organic sugar or other sweetener, so I felt I was almost tricked into buying this, but she would have been upset.  I gave it only one star because of this misrepresentation."
5.0,The Very Best from a Grapefruit Juice Fan,"I have been around many (MANY!) years and have always loved Grapefruit Juice. The problem in recent years has been finding a brand I really liked. Well, all of that searching has paid off. I had never had LANGER'S before. It is delicious. Not too sweet. Something I have found strange over the years is that every once in awhile, I literally crave Grapefruit Juice. I have figured out I must need vitamin C very badly. The price overall is good and you cant beat the quality of the juice."
5.0,Koolaid rocks,The new Peach-Mango Koolaid rocks!! I'm actually thinking of turning this into a daquiri or some sort of mixed drink!...lol. Just because I really like I am sure they won't keep it around long.
5.0,certo,"great mixed with purple grape juice for Arthritis joint pain. 3oz and 2 teaspoon certo, 3 times a day."
5.0,My Macaw thank you,"Goldie  my Macaw loves Macadamia nuts, but buying them at the store was breaking the bank, we purchased a year supply for one low price.  Thank you!!"
1.0,Price is almost double that of the other retailers,"STOP...don't buy from this retailer....they charge 21.50 for ONE bottle. All the other retailers sell 2 for 26....even the local supermarket sells it for less. Too bad I wasn't paying attention....I just assumed I was going to get 2 bottles. The oil is ok and while I'd give it 3 stars, at 21.50, it isn't worth it."
5.0,ZipFizz order,Found this product initially at Costco and wanted more of one flavor.  Found it offered on Amazon when the Costco no longer stocked the item and was more than happy with the order of Citrus flavor 20 tube boxes I received.
5.0,Great Sample Pack,"Thanks for offering a sample pack, wanted to try these before committing to a 24 pack and not like them"
5.0,It's about time...,"Anyone who's reading this should know just how good this product is.  I am just lucky, after running to every Starbucks in the area to grab as many can's as were available when I found out they were closed out,  they managed to bring this product back.  I had just used up my last stashed can."
5.0,The only coffee used in my house," Folgers Classic Roast Ground Coffee, 22.6-Ounce Packages (Pack of 3)   Great coffee. However, way overpriced. I recently purchased the 33.9-ounce (pack of 6) for $47 (free shipping)through a different web-site. My order arrived in 3 days."
1.0,Did not match advertisement,"We were very disappointed by this order.  The description stated ""case"" and what we received were only individual packages of the bones.  This made the price we paid Amazon higher than the packages are sold for at retail stores.  Very misleading."
5.0,great and cheap!,"ill get the neg's out of the way. ....the bag. fist time i used it the glue holding on the ziplock part, came unglued. thats it.  as fo the product its great. many servings for a great price considering acai is an expensive product and difficult to handle. i emailed navitas and they informed me that this product is considered ""RAW"" so it is not denatured and none of the benefits derived are damaged or altered. plus with the powder over the liquid, you get the skin kept in the mix which with fruits and such, this is where most of the beneficials come from. so i say A+  oh and taste is great. i literally teaspoon some and just put it in my mouth twice a day. study acai and stop your other supps so you can buy this as a replacement. benefits are endless in this nutrient deficient society. and real food is the most bio-available source!!"
1.0,not pleased,"The pots broke my senseo coffee maker. They do not fit, too thick. I have used both trays, but non worked. Take this product of the marked."
1.0,"Really, Really, Bad","These are really, really, bad.  I got them as a lightening deal and wouldn't encourage anyone to buy these.  As a previous reviewer stated, they have a terrible chemical taste to them.  I'm really disappointed in these.  Save your money and buy EAS, Balance, or any other power bar but this brand.  I mean, they are just awful."
5.0,Numi Tea Dancing Leaves Teapot,"I got the Numi Tea Dancing Leaves Teapot for my wife. She collects teapots and drinks tea while cozying up with a book or with my daughter as they enjoy pastries, etc. The teapot is just the right size for their small tea party."
5.0,Excellent natural flavor,"Delicious peanut flavor.  Tasts better than Skippy natural, in my opinion.  I recently switched because I think the Jif has more peanut flavor whereas the Skippy has more shell taste to it.  Does require a little bit of stirring tho, but separation is pretty minimal for an all-natural PB.  Excellent work Jif! Ingredients: Peanuts, Sugar, Palm Oil, Salt, Molasses."
1.0,Very Disappointed,"Claxton Dark Fruitcake has been a holiday tradition in our family since the mid 1950's. I ordered it directly from the company this year and when I served it at Thanksgiving, my guests and I thought I must have been fooled by a counterfeit website just claiming to sell Claxton fruitcakes. It was at best 40% fruits and nuts and consisted of a gummy light colored ""cake"". I emailed the company and expressed my disappointment. After several emails back and forth and after today talking to one of the owners, they assured me that it was the original dark recipe.  In reading the ingredients, I noticed that corn syrup, sugar and high fructose corn syrup were listed after flour which was the 4th ingredient. At the very end were listed molasses, spices and 3 artificial food dyes. High fructose corn syrup wasn't widely available until the mid 1970's to mid 1980's, so I'm not sure how it was one of the original ingredients.  All of the people I talked to seemed to have the attitude that I was so stupid that I couldn't possibly be observing what I had correctly. Although they offered to send replacements if I returned it at my own expense, they told me that what I would receive would be identical to what I have. One of the owners informed me that they had received zero complaints this year.  I am grieving the loss of an almost 55 year tradition, but the other 4 cakes are now in the trash."
5.0,Great with a protein shake!,"Drinking this Blue Diamond Almonds chocolate almond milk doesn't have hardly any taste whatsoever on it's own so that's the downside, However, the reason I give it 5 stars is:  1. According to the label on the box: Serving size 1 cup is only 45 calories, 3.5 g fat (0 saturated fat), 0 cholesterol and only 3 total carbs (0 sugar carbs) so you just can't beat it unless you want to just drink water all day.  2. I drink an EGG chocolate protein shake (only a couple calories and carbs) every morning and this tastes the absolute best mixed with the powder shake. I also add a little Sweetleaf all Natural liquid Sweetener (which is 0 calories and 0 carbs), sweetener is much needed and instantly have a great tasting power drink to keep me full until lunch.  3.This chocolate almond drink is also good blended in the ""Bullet"" with ice and again must put in the Sweetleaf sweetener and it's very refreshing. Sometimes I add a bannana to it. Yum!  I am planning on ordering from Amazon the Sweetleaf chocolate all natural sweetener. I know it will be delicious with this chocolate almond milk too. The ""sweetened"" chocolate almond milk is to die for but then again, it's full of calories and carbs so for anyone watching their calorie intake or carb intake this is the one to order (as long as you add the Sweetleaf natural sweetener)."
5.0,AWESOME,"Devoured real fast hard to resist. also great shipping, 5 days!!! good job 5 stars!! AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME"
5.0,Ceylon Tea,Outstanding Indian Ceylon Tea.  This is as good as the tea I had when I visited Russia. I tried a lot of tea's to find a Black Tea as good as this one.  I like the price and packing from Amazon as well.  Very economical.
5.0,Delicious,"I have loved these things since I was a kid, but it's unbelievably hard to find them in person. When I saw them selling in packs of 24 here, I wasted no time in ordering 2. They arrived very quickly, and after some distribution among friends, they were all gone in a matter of 3 days. The only buyer's remorse here is that I didn't buy more."
5.0,Wow Love the Pie Crust,Im so grateful for finding the sugar free pie crusts. They are super. They have great flavor and are totally sugar free
5.0,life saver,"Anyone who has to take medicines that constipate you, this is your saviour...just don't take it within an hour of your meds, cause the senna will make the medicine not digest. I have used this with my doctor's approval for 3 years now and it always works, and the results are gentle and natural. Plus, you can  adjust the strength from day to day as needed ....you can tell whether you need to change the strength by your results. It is not a drug, and it allows you to work  with your own knowledge of your body because you can make it weaker or stronger as needed. I would not go without it....."
1.0,Avoid this merchant!,Avoid Falcon Farms!  They do not deliver what they advertise.  I ordered approximately one week ago and did not receive anything even remotely similar to what was pictured in the ad.  I feel completely deceived.  Avoid!
1.0,"My dog loves everything, but hates this.","I wasted my money.  I tried putting different cereal, dog foods, etc. in this, and my dog ignores it completely."
5.0,Excellent cheese,"I was very pleased with the cheese selection I received. It was packed in a styrofoam cooler with ice packs and arrived quickly after being shipped. They won't deliver in summer, but it's worth waiting for cooler weather. There was a lot more cheese than I expected because each one weighed well over a pound. It seems to be a reasonable price, even with shipping, for everything that I received. The pepper jack was nice and hot, the mild cheddar was smooth and mild. Very good tasting and definately not your grocery store cheese. I would definately buy this again."
5.0,Peanut butter heaven!!!,This is THE best peanut butter dessert I've ever had...a combination of creamy and crunchy in the center and with an outer shell of milk chocolate that cracks when you bite into it! Sooooo goood!!!

5.0,"For a decaf coffee, this is good","I got this coffee at a discount shelf, as doctors just put me on a no caffein diet, last year. I like the taste which is much better than most decaffs I've tried. The fact that it is Organic and Antioxidant is a bonus. It is the only thing I drink in the morning now. I even take it on vacation with me. greg"
5.0,TalkingRain Sparkling Essence water,"This is great sparkling water.  Love having it shipped to my home. When I lived in Miami I would get another product manufactured there, at a cheaper price and when I could find it in the stores.  This is so convenient and comes in very sturdy bottles which I can re-use. Will keep re-ordering it via subscribe and save."
5.0,mouth watering candy,excellent chocolate. Arrived on time. very pleased with purchase. Toblerone is a world class chocolate& I shortly will be ordering more.
5.0,"Amazing results with a combination of Benecol, oatmeal & no dairy","Last spring, I had borderline high LDL (146, where it should be less than 130).  I started using this product in May 2011, but unfortunately, as I was traveling over the summer, I wasn't as good about taking it as I should have been.  My goal was to take it 3x a day, but in foreign countries, in the heat on the road, the little squares would often get melty and smashed in my small travel fanny pack, and then weren't very palatable, so often I only had 1 per day, not optimum.  When I came back from traveling in September, I had my cholesterol checked, and it was 136.  Lower, but not below the magic number of 130.  On September 12 I made a pledge to take the chews 3-4 times per day, and then recheck my cholesterol again in late November.  Full disclosure:  I also added in 1/2 cup of oatmeal every day because I had read this can lower cholesterol.  I also cut all dairy products, but did not cut out red meat, which I eat 2-4 days a week.  My diet was basically oatmeal (but no other carbs) fruits, lots of veggies of every sort, beef, pork, chicken and fish, with no dairy and very low sugar.  It was very similar to my diet before (when LDL cholesterol was at 146), but without the dairy products.  I was hoping that the combination of the 1 serving of oatmeal, no dairy and 3-4 Benecol chews per day would lower my cholesterol 15 points or so.  Was I EVER surprised when I saw the results... in a late November cholesterol check, my LDL was down to 81... a drop (from the May reading of 146) 65 points!!!!  Now granted, it's not clear how much of the result was from the Benecol, how much was from the oatmeal, and how much was from the no dairy/no sugar.  But I feel confident that the Benecol is definitely a big part of the success.  I will definitely keep using this product.  My only complaint is what is noted in the beginning of this review; if you are traveling it is hard to remember to take it at all the meals, and if you carry it around with you, it tends to get soft and squishy.  If you put in into a small hard container (like a medium-sized plastic pill bottle, or a square plastic soap container) that would prevent it getting squished.  You just have to remember to grab 3-4 each morning out of your suitcase and bring them with you each day."
1.0,RANCID,I almost fell over when I opened the bag.  Product was rotten. I returned it for a full refund.
5.0,Perfect in every category and delicious!!  Highly recommend!,"I've tried them all, literally.  I came across this drink completely by accident while I was at Whole Foods.  Looked at all of the healthy, organic ingredients and told myself this looks awesome but it must taste like chalk.  Too impressed with ingredient and nutritional profile, I bought one anyway.  Chilled it , drank it the next morning after my morning workout and I was AMAZED!!  Taste, consistency, and most importantly the way I felt after was incredible.  They use complex carbs from brown rice for a slower releasing , long lasting energy source that I actually felt (no crash from sugary drinks).  They use organic whey!!, yes organic whey! protein which is almost impossible to find anywhere and the best available kind.  All the antioxidants and vitamins are a huge plus especially if you work out as much I do.  I'm a triathlete and orthopedic surgeon so I like to review everything extremely carefully before consuming.  This drink is an 11/10 in every category!  Keep up the good work guys and I'm looking forward to another flavor because I drink 2-3 a day."
5.0,Favorite for Years!,"Everyone in our office loves this gum!  We've been buying it for years and years.  The grandchildren only ask me for gum because they know I carry the two-piece Chiclets packages in my pocketbook, and it's their favorite also!  It's all we buy!"
1.0,Not Good,"This product is very HARD to eat! It is semi-transparent, so it really resembles TAPE WORMS. It doesn't taste bad. It's just very difficult to look at while preparing and eating. I've tried it with no sauce and I've tried it with Spaghetti sauce and it is just bizarre looking. Still have 3 packages left and am hoping a white sauce will disguise them better. Maybe they are meant to be eaten by very dim candlelight. :-{"
5.0,Yum!,I eat this almost every day for lunch. It has a hearty broth and is vegan/gluten-free. Definitely tasty and worth the purchase.
1.0,lived 3 days,i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol
1.0,Disappointed,"I'd like to try something different and chose this one. I was so disappointed, tasted plain, cannot be compared with  Ferrara Instant Espresso Coffee, 2-Ounce Glass Jars (Pack of 6) .I used the latter in Baking and it worked perfectly. I don't even want to try this in my cake recipe!  The worse thing is I cannot return this item and don't know what should I do with the rest. It may be my personal taste, but it is better to just buy one jar at the first time to see whether you like it or not."
5.0,Great Product For Your Small Dog!,"I couldn't find my dog's favorite treat anywhere in any of my local pet stores or grocery stores.  I decided to check out Amazon to see if by chance, I could find them here.  Sure enough!  I was able to purchase them with no problem at all.  Shipping was quick and the price was good!  Recommend to everyone who gives their dogs dental treats!"
5.0,Big Bold is it,"I drink my coffee black because I want to taste the coffee, and this is the smoothest bold coffee I've ever had."
5.0,black lava,"I love this salt. It tastes fantastic; I even find myself putting it on things I normally wouldn't salt. I've gotten my husband to buy me more of the sea salts, they are all equally delicious!"
1.0,Great product but here it is way overpriced.,I'm sitting here munching on these and they are delicious. However I am giving one star because this price is more than double what you should be paying. I bought a package last night at Trader Joe's for $3. At this pricing they're charging over $6 a pack!  Just go to TJ's to get your dried mango goodness.
5.0,Great Tea,Great Japanese Green Tea. I love it. Stay green color most of the time and test nature sweet green tea.
5.0,Delicious,These things are so delicious that I just wrote a review of a granola bar.
5.0,"Perfect biscuits, perfectly intact","My local grocery store no longer sells McVitie's so I was overjoyed to find I could order in bulk here! As you can see from the photo I added, they come wrapped in multiple layers of air and boxes. No breakage - I got 7 packs of perfect biscuits just in time for wintertime heavy tea drinking!"
5.0,The best dog treats,Dog treats from Artic Paws are by far the best I have ever purchased for my Rottewiler. They are a great training or otherwise treat.
5.0,Excellent Maple Syrup!,"Great service, as always, from Amazon. I enjoy this maple syrup everyday with yoghurt and with my cream of wheat."
5.0,Delicious!,"I thought they were really tasty. They are crumbly but it's not a brownie. More like the love child of a granola bar and a brownie. Both my 4 yr old and my 16 mos old loved them. My local grocery store doesn't carry them, which is unfortunate since the kids have been requesting more. I bought them as a treat for myself and only got to eat 1 and a half."
1.0,not at all as described missing the culture,"in the photo, it has everything needed in the kit. But you have to get the SCOBY Culture by entering a code, so when it the kit comes, you have to wait all over again to actually make the tea, because there is no culture.  I should have ordered it from someone else. seriously dissapointed....."
5.0,We love this gum!,"I try to give my kids things without artificial ingredients.  This gum is a huge hit in my house.  I do wish the flavor lasted longer, but the kids are used to natural gum and don't complain.  Its hard to find gum with natural ingredients and sugar free is a nice bonus.  We also enjoy the regular glee gum flavors that have sugar."
1.0,Four Units Same Drive Shaft Lock-Up Issue,"We love this unit when it is working and has become a staple in preparing food for a son. The down side is every 2 to 3 months the Drive Shaft locks up. We have been going back to the store and exchanging it for another one. At first we thought it was user error and we might have gotten the Drive Shaft wet causing it to lock up. But we never put it in water, the dishwasher and only wipe it down and immediate dry it and every single Brezza has developed the locking Drive Shaft. I have read in another post Brezza has a fix and recall in place for the Drive Shaft! We have not received a message from Brezza about this. I have e-mailed them looking for some assistance. In the mean time we are off to do another exchange today.  The Drive Shaft locking up as been our only issue and it this is in fact fixed I would be inclined to change my rating."
1.0,I was wrong,"So despite several negative reviews saying this candy was hard and stale, I thought I'd give it a try, choosing to believe the positive reviews instead. Boy was I wrong. This candy arrived promptly through Amazon Prime, but it's so hard you could break your teeth on it. There was no evidence of any temperature issues during transportation. The wrapping was fine and not stuck to the candy as some have said. It was just plain stale and hard as rocks. Utterly disappointing. If you were thinking about this candy and thought you'd ignore the negative reviews, don't. You will be disappointed."
5.0,"Looks like vomit, the dogs love it.","This food seriously is seriously gross looking. Merrick's regular line of wet food products have kind of a chunky look to them, where you can see the peas and carrots and whatnot. Well, Before Grain must live up to its 96% meat claim, because all you get when you open it up is pureed pink nastiness... which your dogs are going to go bananas over! The pureed consistency makes it super easy to mix in with their dry food. I keep some cans on hand for the days when my dogs are being finicky with their food -- or I just feel like giving them an extra treat!  The ingredient list speaks for itself. Like all Merrick products, I highly recommend this for your precious pup."
5.0,Cannot get better hot sauce or service at such a great price,"I am a cajun. Face it. A Louisiana red-neck who loves hot sauce. But Tabasco is my favorite brand. I used to pay a fortune buying the small bottles at Sam's. Now you can save BIG bucks by purchasing a GALLON from Avery Island with great shipping and better pricing. Thanks McIlhenny! Cheers, Seth"
5.0,My Favorite Food in the World,"Dominosteine is the best treat ever, and Lambertz makes the absolute best.  If you enjoy German desserts and cookies, you MUST try these."
5.0,staple for a gluten free family,"My kids and I love these crackers.  They are perfect for the days when we are out of gluten free bread.  We just make cracker sandwiches.  My children love to eat these with cream cheese and (canned)salmon spread out over the cracker.  Buying from amazon is the only way we could afford these crackers, as they cost too much in the local stores."
5.0,Great Product-  Sloppy Packing,"I love Braggs-  This 6-pack seemed liked a real good deal.  Unfortunately, whoever packed my order had no common sense and they put this on top of other items in my order and those items arrived broken.  They put all six bottles in a thin, plastic bag.  When my order arrived, everything in it including the box, was soaked in Braggs.  I will never order Braggs from Amazon again, I will buy it somewhere else."
1.0,One word: Horrid,"To prefix, I will eat almost anything, dried squid jerky, octopus served in its ink, sesame and seaweed Chinese candy (unleaded), intense ginger candy, and strange sea creatures that are squishy. Pulparindo and other Mexican salt candies must require some kind of tongue that I was not born with.  It causes my brain to do flips, not comprehending what I am eating.  Is it a salty snack, or is it candy?  These are two worlds that should not come together.  What next, pork Jolly Ranchers, or shrimp Jelly Bellies?"
1.0,False cinnamon,"This is not cinnamon. This is cassia which has been implicated in liver and kidney disease. In fact, it is illegal to call this product ""cinnamon"" in most European countries. Only ""Ceylon Cinnamon"" is the real, healthy spice, good for heart, glucose and joints."
1.0,buyer beware,"I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and this is the first bad product that I have received. I usually don't bash products but, these are terrible. The root beer and dr pepper clone do smell good at first but, it goes down hill from there. The mountain dew clone was the worst, I about gagged. All have the same nasty bitter taste and terrible odor with the individual flavor added on top. All 24 cans down the drain or should I say 27 bucks down the drain. It kind of reminds me of red bull or a preworkout/no2 drink. Fine if you have to drink it but, not if you want a drink to enjoy. I use stevia daily in my ice tea and coffee and it is great so, I don't think it's the stevia."
1.0,Poor quality,"I LOVE these strawberries, but this batch came up short on flavoring. The candy didn't even small like strawberries, just tasted like gummi sugar. Somehow this batch got missed when they added flavoring. I will try them again. Vendor shipped fast and they were very fresh."
5.0,C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E ),"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.  WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.  Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed. But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!  Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )  I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me! These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours (paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)  The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:  Potatoes Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil), Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey), Rice Powder Sugar Salt Onion Powder Tomato Powder Paprika Torula Yeast Garlic Powder Chili Pepper Citric Acid Cayenne Pepper Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour) Natural Smoke Flavour  Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!  Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key. Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production  As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!  Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )  These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE, are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!  Flavoured potato PERFECTION!"
1.0,Tastes awful AND is high in sodium,"I agree with some reviewers that this is bland and tasteless, but I'd go as far as to say it tastes weird. I'm a huge fan of miso, and this didn't have any miso taste to it. My cup also had 2 tiny pieces of seaweed, 1 TINY mushy piece of what I'm guessing was supposed to be tofu, and no mushrooms.  I also read the nutrition facts and it had a LOT of sodium, which is shocking since it tasted so bland. Moreover, it said 1 of these 1.9 ounce cups is 2 servings. That's preposterous. How could 1 oz. of anything (even with the addition of bland broth) count as a serving? I think they only made it into 2 servings because otherwise, 1 of these cups would probably be 50+% of your daily sodium allowance? I threw my cup away, so I can't check it, but believe me, it had a shocking amount of sodium for gross, bland noodles."
5.0,Yum!,"This is great stuff.  I got it for my smoothies, but it also tastes good enough to put in just water or even milk.  It is not as soluble as I would prefer, but that is natural for some of the many healthy ingredients."
1.0,Taste stale,"The box shows Best Before Feb 28 2010, but they taste stale.  Some bars are broken in pieces.  I wonder how long they have been on the shelf?  Very disappointed."
5.0,The best of Gluten-free,"We have tried lots of gluten-free products and flours (even concocted $$ mixtures of various flours) but nothing really beats Pamela's Baking Mix.  There are a ton of recipes on the Pamela's website using the GF baking mix so you get a lot of bang for your buck with this baking mix.  Great pancakes, sweet breads, muffins, cookies, etc."
1.0,Sawdust!,"We bought this cereal after reading great reviews. However, when we opened the box, we found the product to be mostly ground to a sawdust consistency. We were extremely disappointed. Avoid this unless you are prepared to open up a box of cereal that's practically dust."
1.0,Product Broke,Product was great for the firs week then it would not open so we had to throw it away i wouldnt suggest getting one unless you have income to blow
5.0,DELICIOUS TASTY TREATS FOR ADULTS,These were awesome stocking stuffers!  Handsome box of nice adult chocolates.  They were delicious.
5.0,Love but always out of stock!,"Kal is awesome, but they seem to always have a limited supply!  I hope they can start churning out more! :)"
1.0,"Seams split, some bags slashed","I had been happily using these bags for about a year, and ordered them through Amazon's subscribe and save, but in my last shipment of 4 boxes, two of the boxes had bags with weak side seams which split open when I tried to use them. Also, in one of the boxes, some of the bags were slashed or cut, even though the box itself was whole and unmarked. That's 100 bags that are completely unusable.  According to Amazon's return policy, this item is not eligible for return, so you'd be out some money if you order this item and it's defective. I have contacted Amazon anyway, and also written to Biobag USA to register a complaint."
1.0,"Loved at first, but ingredients are not natural!","When I first saw this product I thought, great, all natural coconut and shea butter. It's the latest rave and so good for you. This product also smells so deliciously wonderful, like a coconut/pineapple tropical delight! I really like how it feels on my long frizzy hair and makes it so shiney and smooth. Wonderful stuff!!!  Once I really looked into the ingredients, I was horrified! I've been really looking at ingredients closely these days and did the same with this product.  First ingredient Mineral Oil. Not the greatest stuff since is it a by-product of distillation of gasoline and considered a carcinogenic by some people.  Second, HYDROGENATED Coconut Oil. What does that mean? I know coconut oil in it's raw form is really good in our diets and on our skin. After some google research I found out that Hydrogentated Coconut Oil is created by heating to 500-1000 degrees, then a catalyst is injected. The catalyst is typically nickel, platinum, or even aluminum! This stuff is bad for you! It is closer to plastic than a good for you organic compound.  Sure, you're not putting it IN YOUR BODY, but there is some absorption that takes place when you squeeze it in your hands and through you scalp.  Third ingredient, even worse! Styrene Butadiene Copolymer. Labeled as BHT and most people don't notice this ingredient or even think anything of it. It's Synthetic Rubber used in CAR TIRES, yuck! Embalming fluid, even more yuck! It has been associated to child hyper-activity and cancer.  I just can't give this item a good review. It's not even Gluten Free since it has Wheat Germ Oil. Other ingredients are good, like Sweet Almond Oil and Aloe.  This product feels really nice in my hair and I will use in on an OCCASSIONAL basis, but not on a daily basis. I have found plain shea butter or coconut oil in raw form is the very best thing for my dry, frizzy hair."
5.0,Good Taste,"I was a little concerned about ordering such a large quantity, but the price was good and the reviews were good.  I am happy that I did buy the cherries.  So good for snacking and adding to yogurt and on cereal.  I have not used them yet in baking but plan to make some muffins with adding the cherries to the batter.  Taste, for me, is the right balance between tart and sweet.  After opening, I put the cerries in zip lock bags and placed them in the refrigerator.  The cherries are fresh."
1.0,Chewy Sunbutter NO CRUCH Awful Bar,OMG..... this is Just BAD BAD BAD..... I could not eat this if I was Starving! I took one bite.... My husband took one bite and the box went right into the trash can.
5.0,Bigelow Tea,"I love this tea, I don't drink anything with caffeine in it and my grocery store doesn't carry  this flavor in decaf, so I was thrilled to get it here, plus it was cheaper!"
1.0,This is NOT smoked salt!,"This salt is NOT smoked. Read that again. It is a 2 pound bag of white salt that has a fake hickory smell. It is small crystals, about the size of table salt crystals. My guess is that they tried to infuse flavor into the salt rather than smoking it. The hickory flavor is very faint, and very fake tasting. You are much better off buying real smoked salt, such as Gourmet Hickory Smoked Sea Salt by The Spice Lab Inc. I am not in any way affiliated with The Spice Lab - I bought their salt simultaneously with Faerie's Finest in order to compare the two. Not only is it inferior to The Spice Lab, but Faerie's Finest is the worst smoked salt I have tasted."
1.0,SUGAR?!,"I AM SO PISSED OFF!!  this used to be ""purely o's"", as in NO SUGAR and only wholesome ingredients.  now?  sugar and molasses and fillers!  the VERY LEAST they could have done was written, ""lightly sweetened"" or some other sort of pseudo-honest marketing to let us know that they had changed their formula/recipe.  instead, i order a carton of 4 boxes only to find that these are ""purely crap""!!!  no thanks Cascadian Farms!  you can keep your new cereal that is no better than every other box of sweetened crap out there!"
5.0,"SHIPPING IS EXPENSIVE, BUT...","There have been several comments about the cost of shipping, which I would agree would seem expensive at first glance; however, I know of no other source for the passion fruit and/or guava puree. The quality is wonderful. Other than growing your own,it's the best!"
5.0,Tea,"This tea is delicious and aromatic, I'm completely satisfied with the purchase. Every tea I have ordered from Davidson's has been spectacular."
5.0,Uplifting,"After a 5 way bypass, all my husband wanted was some Carolina Gold rice. Our order arrived promptly and he was beaming.  We discovered it while in Charleston a few yrs. back and he's been in love with it ever since.  Thanks for helping him recover sooner than expected."
1.0,Watse of Money and a Deceiving seller,The candy canes WERE NOT the same as shown - I only got a box of 80 but ALL 1 FLAVOUR.  ALL WERE BROKEN  Don't waste your money or your time with this seller.
5.0,"nom, nom, nom!",I ordered a case of these to include in goodie bags for my nephew's pirate-themed birthday party this year.  The kids (and adults!) loved them.  The bags are generously sized and they are a great-tasting snack that you don't have to feel guilty about eating.  I think I'll order a couple of cases to give out at Hallowe'en this year!
5.0,Tasty Cookies,Nana's Chocolate and chocolate Chip cookies are very tasty. They have no dairy and have all natural sugar (fruit juice) and no trans fat. I like they way they each have their own package so they stay fresher longer. These are the kind of cookies that make you feel like you are eating healthier.
5.0,Really delicious!  Best Kashi bar yet,"I have tried several Kashi TLC bars... I like most of them, but this is by far my favorite flavor, and at 120 calories per bar I don't feel like I'm ""breaking the bank.""  They are satisfying and good for a quick snack when you're on the go.  A smooth layer of chocolate adorns the top, with nuts and coconut.  The chocolate is mixed with dates and other fruits to make it sweeter.  I'm not sure what else to say about these bars - except they're delicious and you should try them.  Hope this helps!"
5.0,After a long search - this is the best licorice,"Whenever I see a new licorice product, I try it. They range from mediocre to inedible. If I wanted to chew leather, I'd buy beef jerky.  Then I found Panda. I have never eaten better licorice."
1.0,I'll Pass,"I love coconut water.  Hands down my favorite drink.  I thought this would be a great idea because it's less expensive and more convenient than buying a young coconut and draining the water out.  It is both of these, but it does not have the same flavor as fresh coconut water.  I guess that's a no brainer.  I can't even bring myself to finish the drink.  It's gross."
1.0,Mmm...plastic.,"I was really excited about this, because I like the Minute Rice cups, and this is cheaper.  When I took it out of the microwave, I noticed a strong plastic odor coming from the bag, but it seemed to dissipate when I poured the rice into the bowl, so I went ahead and took a bite.  YUCK.  The stuff really does taste like the awful plastic smell that came from the bag.  Glad I only bought one bag, 'cause I won't be using it again!"
5.0,I love these things!!!,Like the others who have posted here...I absolutely love Mallo Cups. I grew up in NY and ate these things all of the time but have a hard time coming across them in Oklahoma. Every time I go home to visit family I purchase a bunch of them because they are so hard to find. Now that they are online...I'm in trouble!!! Can't wait to order some!
1.0,Community Coffee Chicory,"I received this order damaged, with most of the chicory gone from one of the open bags.  The other bags were sealed, but were not full.  So I paid for six 12 ounce bags and got about half of the amount that I paid for.  Amazon did not respond to me about this problem, and they did not make restitution nor did they allow me to return the product!  Bad Amazon!  I am really disappointed!  To make matters much worse, I had also ordered the french roast coffee version of this and it never arrived, yet Amazon charged me to ship it to me and to return it to them even though I never received it and I never sent it back!  What is going on at Amazon!!!  Why are they stiffing excellent customers??"
5.0,My puppy loves it more without the rope attached.,"My large puppy (8 mo., 70 lbs, Doberman/Am. Bulldog mix) needed a lot of help getting the food out while the rope was intact, but after he shredded the rope after about two days of gnawing, everything changed.  I cut the inside knot off and left it inside the bottle so that it would slow down the exit of the kibbles.  So now the kibbles come out much easier, but not too easily.  Bottom line, with this slight modification, my puppy LOVES his purple bottle, and the 10 minutes that he spends throwing the bottle around to get his food out is 10 minutes less that he's chewing on things that he shouldn't be or otherwise being naughty."
5.0,Surprising,"I am not fan of oatmeal. I don't care how healthy it is, just didn't like it. However I needed to add more fiber to my diet so I began trying different brands and flavors. My experience has been that the ones with ""healthy"" on the label, taste far worse that those that omitted that word. I must say that when I first tried this oatmeal I was prepared to dislike it before taking the first bite. I was surprised, the flavor is incredible. There are even chunks of apple in it. Now, not only am I eating a lot more oatmeal, but I'm enjoying it. Thanks Kashi!"
5.0,"It was delicious!  BUT, then I love Rhubarb!","WOW, some good bread, toasted, with butter, then covered with Rhubarb jam?  That was out of this world...needless to say, we wished I had purchased a larger jar.  The color wasn't so red it was 'fake looking' and yet enough color so it was appetizing.  Perfectly sweetened also."
1.0,Yummy,These are so good I have them for breakfast an sometimes lunch I also have one for a snack they give me energy to finish my day
1.0,Lindt Lindor Truffles,"The Lindt Lindor Truffles arrived at our doorstep melted. Huge waste, $31.00 worth of inconsumable product. I will not order candy from Amazon again."
1.0,what LOBSTER????,this is VERY HIGH PRICED POTATO SOUP 1 TENTH OF A OUNCE OF LOBSTER FOR 6 BUCKS..THE CAN SHOULD READ YOU NEED TO LOOK HARD TO FIND SOME...
1.0,Watch out!,"My puppy loves nylabones and it usually takes him a few months to start to rip off the pieces of the bone.  However, with this bone, he worked on it for one day and had eaten the entire top part off.  By the time I had seen what happened, I was looking around for the pieces, hoping he spit them out.  Well, obviously he didn't because he spent the night throwing up the pieces of the nylabone.  I will not be getting this kind of nylabone again."
1.0,I used to like it but they made it too sweet now,"This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!"
1.0,white stash tea,this white chai tea is infused with cinnamon and other spices. it tastes like liquid pumpkin pie!  yuk!
1.0,Not Good!!!,"This is the worst tea I have tried in a very long time. I have NO plans to ever buy it again and I recommend you don't either. What I have left over and I have several ounces left over, I will toss it out!"
1.0,This is not pretzel salt,"Save your money especially for shipping, this is NOT pretzel salt.  This salt is nothing more than kosher salt that you pay alot for shipping to your house, you can get this in any grocery store.  I had purchased pretzel salt before from amazon and could not remember the company so I bought this, without reading the reviews.  I have since found the company which is called the Spice Barn.  I am not sure if they sell through amazon or not, but the [...] does sell that really white salt you get on soft pretzels.  You can find them at:  [...]"
5.0,Baby Food Cake,Rarely find the baby fruit I used to make a Baby Food Cake so ordered it fom Amazon...came very promptly and now I have plenty to make several cakes.  Good deal!  Pat Thompson
1.0,"Won't be ordering these again, pop too small","I ordered these hoping to have something more special than Orville, but these rarely come out of the pantry anymore. They pop much too small and once popped they are more hard then puffy and soft. The dark kernels are also quite unpleasing visually, looking like burnt popcorn. Finally, the ratio of fluffy popcorn to interior kernel is too low.  If I ever want to have an authentic old-world treat of pre-hybridized and optimized popcorn, I'll pull these out. Until then, I'll stick with my Orville's that pop huge and fluffy and don't leave so many un-popped kernels behind.  I notice a lot of the 5-star reviewers are either comparing this to microwave popcorn or are the type of people who think a misting of Olive Oil is a ""delicious"" topping? I can only laugh. So take those reviews with a grain of salt (haha). One even bemoaned that it isn't ""organic.""  But if you like your popcorn with salt and butter and would judge this on its merits and not because it comes in a package and name meant to entice psuedo-foodies and vegans, I say pass it up and go with a name brand that let's you use half the kernels and get the same amount of popcorn. And if you've only ever eaten microwave popcorn, this isn't the popcorn to switch to.  UPDATE: Ran out of Orville, so I dipped into my India Tree again. I'm throwing the rest away. If there is a special technique to get these things to taste good, pop evenly or simply be edible, I haven't figured it out."
1.0,Vet says NO,"These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems. She asked, are these the ones made in China?  I said yes, and she said she wouldn't take the chance.  I just threw the last (full) bag into the garbage. Please don't take a chance with your pup!"
1.0,STILL haven't receive my order!,"Ordered my item on Mar. 27..Ok, well its Apr. 24. Wheres my stuff? Push pops said its been shipped and the estimated date was Apr. 16. Im beyond pissed because I need this item for my daughters 1st bday which is coming up fast! Horrible service. I won't be ordering from Push pops never again."
5.0,Begging for more!!!!,My dogs love this food!!!  at times i see them picking out the dried veggies in this mix and eating those first....Kinda Funny!  well before i started my dogs on this food.... they were having some really bad gas problems.... They would stink me out of a room.... when they started eating this one.... No more Stinky gas!!!
5.0,Best coffee available,"Tully's Breakfast Brew in my opinion is the best coffee available for the price.  I drink two to three cups every morning, and it is a great way to start the day."
5.0,RATE THIS PRODUCT A 10 OUT OF 10!!,"ALONG WITH ROTEL HOT DICED TOMATOES, I USE THE CHUNKY DICED IN MY HOMEMADE SALSA & SCRAMBLED EGGS & ADD IT TO ALMOST ANYTHING.  IT ISN'T HOT & IT HAS A TERRIFIC TASTE."
1.0,FIX spearmint Altoids!,"The original spearmint Altoids flavor was my favorite flavor.  The ""new and improved"" version is quite nasty in comparison.  Please bring back the original spearmint flavor!"
5.0,Delicious!,"Low glycemic, gluten free, all natural but the most important thing - they taste great!!!  I would definitely order again and would recommend to others. Ordering thru Amazon is much cheaper than I have found these KIND bars in the health stores near me so it makes this a good deal."
1.0,Don't waste your money.,"I trusted the other good reviews, but this tastes awful and has a bad aftertaste.  Yuk."
5.0,Exactly what I expected.,"This is your basic Easy Mac.  I actually prefer this packaging over the version that comes with its own little bowl.  If you have a measuring cup that can measure 2/3 of a cup, and a bowl, you don't need to get the kind with the bowls, which I find wasteful.  Either way, they are a great snack.  I think they have 260 calories, so they are not a meal.  Either way, if you've had Easy Mac before, and like it, this is the same stuff.  If you are picky about your macaroni, this is not the macaroni for you.  If you really find it bland you can always do what I do an put a little bit of sriracha in right before you eat it."
1.0,"Can we have the sugar back, please?","I realize that perhaps I should have read the label, but if the bottle doesn't say ""artificially sweetened"" then the consumer has an expectation that formulations have not been changed.  Tang is now just nasty tasting.  Tang has been reformulated to include not one...but Three artificial sweeteners, two of which have not had significant peer reviewed human testing and one of which is a known chemical danger.  I realize that companies want to make a profit by using something cheaper than sugar, but this is ridiculous.  sucralose = splenda: Splenda (sucralose) is trichlorosucrose. It contains a primary unhindered alkyl chloride that one would not be surprised to find reactive as an alkylating agent with protein pendent lysine residues and other nucleophiles (including anchimeric assistance with one anomer and the open form). One is generally ill-advised to chronically ingest halogenated organics as food.  Acesulfame potassium: Several potential problems associated with the use of acesulfame have been raised. They are based largely on animal studies since testing on humans remains limited. The findings showed the following: Acesulfame K has been shown to stimulate insulin secretion in rats in a dose-dependent fashion thereby possibly aggravating reactive hypoglycemia (""low blood sugar attacks""). Acesulfame K apparently produced lung tumors, breast tumors, rare types of tumors of other organs (such as the thymus gland), several forms of leukemia and chronic respiratory disease in several rodent studies, even when less than maximum doses were given. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, it was petitioned for a stay of approval by the FDA because of ""significant doubt"" about its safety.  NeoTame: As its patent for aspartame was running out, Monsanto developed a new, more potent version of its synthetic sweetener.  By adding 3-dimethylbutyl (a chemical the Environmental Protection Agency lists as hazardous) to aspartame, scientists at Monsanto drastically increased the sweetening power of the additive. The new version was named neotame.  The non-profit group, Truth in Labeling, gained access to some of the neotame studies. They write, ""At the time of our review of Monsanto's application, three human studies on the safety of neotame were presented. The studies had few subjects, all of whom were employees of the company. Some of the subjects reported headaches after ingesting neotame, but the researchers concluded that the headaches were not related to neotame ingestion. Not mentioned in the studies was the fact that migraine headache is, by far, the most commonly reported adverse reaction to aspartame in the files of the FDA."""
5.0,Great stuff,This is my new staple for lunch at work. Tastes as good as the regular stuff. Just add water and nuke for 3 minutes. Highly recommended.
1.0,really bad,"I was hoping to find a gluten-free gravy comparable to traditional gravy for my own personal Thanksgiving dinner (I'm the only one in my family who is gluten-free, and I couldn't ask the host to make a wheat-free gravy just for me). My own attempts from scratch have been okay in flavor, but lacking in appearance or consistency (they either looked like white gravy or were lumpy), and the gluten-free mix packets have been a flavorless disappointment. So when I found this pre-made gravy, I was ecstatic. I thought it had to be better than the packets and my previous attempts. I toted it to my sister's house on Thanksgiving and heated it just before dinner. Before I was about to slather it all over my Thanksgiving plate (I LOVE gravy. LOTS of gravy)...I grabbed a spoon and took a pre-dinner taste-test.  OMG, I'm glad I did. It is absolutely disgusting. It resembles NOTHING of real gravy except the color. The taste is a cross between Elmers glue, melted plastic and candle wax. I couldn't allow it to touch any part of my plate and went the entire holiday gravy-less (and was not happy about it).  I don't write many reviews, but I can't believe anyone thought this stuff deserved a package and a price. I threw the entire box out, and I am better for it."
5.0,R.S. Granola S.F.  bars,If you love cinnamon rolls and cannot have sugar this is it.  Has great texture and flavor. A must have for dieters.
1.0,Skip-Worthy!,"First, let me say I'm an adult, so maybe that affects my tastes.  On the other hand, though, I have not one but 32 sweet teeth.  With that being said, I'm going to be bold and assert that the Chewy Gooey Chocofudge cookies are going to be too sweet for anyone over the age of 11.  Unless you're drinking really black coffee with them.  The kind of black coffee that is so dark and strong, you wouldn't be able to see ANY light through it if it were in a clear cup. Besides that, if you're looking at these cookies here on Amazon with intent to order a bunch, you should note that they don't travel well.  My package arrived looking like most of the cookies went through a rock tumbler (on the bright side, I guess they're ready to be made into a cookie-crumb crust?).  They ARE chewy.  Gooey?  I wouldn't go that far.  Maybe on a really hot day, or if you put some on a plate and microwaved a few seconds.  Finally, they have sort of a Play-Doh aftertaste if Play-Doh were made with lots and lots of sugar.  Chips Ahoy has a good thing going with their original cookies.  I think these are an abomination and should be skipped right over with no regrets."
1.0,Habanero BBQ bust,I really like spicy things and love Blue Diamond Almonds.  I tried these and was really disappointed- there is really not much flavor and barely any spice.  The BBQ spices are really weak and the heat is almost non-existent. I would recommend trying another flavor- the Wasabi ones are great!
1.0,False Advertising,"I received a cactus ""stick"" a little over six inches in height.  It is in the process of being rooted.  They advertised ""one gal plant. Blooming, fruiting size.""  This is completely false.  There is nothing blooming, and this is not ""fruiting size.""  I know, because I have a collection of these cacti.  The ""stick"" has no branches or segments on it.  The ""one gal"" was a plastic pot, one-third filled with dirt with the ""stick"" shoved down into it, the rest was empty and was totally unnecessary but was presumably used to help drive up the cost of shipping and handling.  They are claiming that the current price is marked down from $49.99 suggesting a great deal of savings.  That, too, is an outrageous claim."
1.0,Tastes nothing like real tiramisu,"Should've figured this out- a product that is shipped unrefrigerated can't have any dairy in it, and therefore cannot contain any of the wonderful filling of real tiramisu.  It't more like sponge cake with generic, flavorless 'creme' spread inside.  No coffee taste, no liquor-soaked ladyfingers, no cool creamy dairy; boring.  Not worth the calories."
1.0,"Worst tasting Celsius product ever, by far!","I have had about 9 flavours of Celsius products, which I believe is all of them.  My ranking (Best to Worst) based on my preference:  Sparkling Ginger Ale Green Tea Peach Mango Strawberry Kiwi Iced Lemon Tea Sparkling Wild Berry Sparkling Orange Sparkling Cola Green Tea Raspberry Acai Apple Orchard (Stevia)  The Ginger Ale, Green Tea Peach mango, and Strawberry Kiwi are top notch to me, very tasty!  Everything up to the Cola is really good in my opinion.  The Raspberry Acai doesn't taste nearly as good as the others to me, but most friends like it.  The Apple Orchard is SOOOOOO incredibly BAD that it makes me feel nauseous, and makes me like the Raspberry Acai (which I previously detested) much more.  A friend who usually likes the Stevia sweetener flavour found in the Apple Orchard describe the flavour of Apple Orchard as 'monkey urine.'"
1.0,100% X-Juice not 100% X,"Tricky Marketing (Look up ""True (sic) Blue"" dig deep into their site or study the vague label.)  ""100% Cranberry Juice"" is false labeling; ""100% Juice Cranberry"" passes...; has other juices for sweetening (apple, grape, pear) and for attractiveness: anything goes. Just no sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Hence 100% juice. With sugar is called ""natural sweetening."" ""Blend"" might not be 100% juices. Juice ""Cocktail"" is invariably with high fructose corn syrup.  I found real Ocean Spray 100% Cranberry Juice in quarts at a ""Grocery Outlet"" market once a few years ago. Undrinkably tart, but perfect for making my own less-than-sweet blends and thirst-aides using fresh berries and fruits with water, and for extending store-shelf juices too sweet for me. 100% C.J. is not a consumer product, but for food & beverage product makers.  Cranberry Juice Concentrate is also very handy & 100% CJ."
5.0,GREAT for this WEIGHT WATCHER!,"The shipping on these is prohibitive, but I eat these and MIRACLE NOODLES all the time.  How to prepare: 1. Open bag 2. Hold nose 3. Rinse well with hot water 4. Dry roast in a big pan.  I add Laughing Cow cheese, a can of roasted diced tomatoes, fresh basil, sauteed or roasted vegetables for a great big bowl of low calorie pasta.  A whole bag of these noodles has only 40 calories.  See [...] for lots of recipes.  They are, admittedly, an acquired taste."
1.0,Nutrition Info Misleading,"Checking nutrition info on this product today at the Eugene, OR Costco, these snacks appeared to be remarkably healthy for a fruit snack. I did a double-take, and  a triple-take on the number of servings per box. Number of servings is triple the number of pouches in the box! Serving size = 9 pieces. If the snackers in your world are sufficiently disciplined, or smallish of appetite, to be satisfied with a third of a pouch of fruit snacks, bon appetit! Sidebar: If you could be so polite as to not add to Costco's excessive packaging habit by re-packing your fruit snacks into Baggies-of-Nine, well, that would be appreciated and more power to you."
5.0,My favorite pancake syrup,"This is my very favorite pancake syrup for two reasons. Reason one is that you can heat the syrup in the bottle making it easy to have hot syrup for your hot cakes. Reason two is the syrup is thick, rich and buttery tasting. I love this syrup.  Unfortunately our local stores quit carrying this syrup so I will now have to buy it from Amazon.  Highly recommend."
5.0,A Richly Satisfying Healthy Gourmet Snack,"When I stumbled upon Sahale Valdosta Blend, I was in heaven.  It's healthy with a wonderful combination of flavors.  It's high in antioxidants and low in sodium and I can actually eat it (with all of my  sensitive GI issues).  I actually eat it for a meal when I'm on the road.  You've got to try it!"
5.0,Product and service wonderful,Arrived just as describe in a timely manner.  Product has worked well in all our baking we have done thus far.
5.0,Love the taste!  Stats on the content percentages within,"I love the taste of the nuts. I like them out of the box as well as mixed in with cooking just about anything. The only down side is that I have to taper my love due to calories: 1 ounce of nuts has 170 calories (130 from fat).  In a recent Consumer report I found an interesting statistic on content of Planters Nuts.  The following percentages are averages from analysing three containers of Planters nuts. 48% of all nuts are peanuts 24% of all nuts are almonds 15% of all nuts were cashews 6% of all nuts were brazil nuts 4% of all nuts were hazelnuts 3% of all nuts were pecans  I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called  ""Online Price Alert"".  This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on ""online price alert"" in Google it will be come up at the top.  I find this tool to be very helpful."
5.0,really impressed!!,Just received this candy in the mail today and I an super impressed!! The seller shipped it on the day I ordered it. I am having a lego party for my son and this filled up 25 bags with enough left to decorate cupcakes for his classroom treat. My son is so excited to give them to his friends. We tasted them and they are a little harder then a sweet tart but my 5 and 6 year olds didn't have a problem and they thought they were delicious!! I figured there would be some broken pieces from shipping but I only found 1 broken piece. They are well made and well packaged!!
5.0,Great tasting!!,"It's really crispy and the amount of chocolate filling is generous! It's at least 3 times cheaper getting it in bulk of 25 packs, as compared to buying it from the local supermarts."
1.0,D.O.P? Not really....,"The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not...."
1.0,syrup not beans.....,This says it is jelly beans but instead it is 6 bottles of toasted marshmallow syrup.......kinda hard to place in bags like i was planning.....lol....had to send it back.
1.0,Caution,I returned this item because it contains palm oil.  Bad for the body and VERY bad for our planet.
5.0,It blends nicely with the green coconut water.,"I bought this flavor because it was cheaper. I love coconut water because of all of its potassium and naturally hydrating traits. The lychee is a sweet, bland flavor that balances the sometimes bitter tang of green coconuts. This brand is not as sweet as VitaCoco's water and adding lychee did not make Naked's overwhelming by any means. It was less invasive than say, adding pineapple juice. For me, that worked."
1.0,awful flour,awful.  tried this flour and it is awful.  cookies melted in the oven to soup.  doesnt hold its consistency.  have no idea how it'd taste because the food was not edible.  very dissappointing
5.0,Finally!  Vanilla Only!,"My local store only carries the vanilla-strawberry-blueberry packs.  The vanilla is my favorite.  Excellent product, not dry like most other cereal bars."
1.0,Made in China,"Unfortunately, Made in China. I do not trust their manufacturing standards.  Looking for an alternative...."
1.0,Dry and tasteless,"Do not waste your money.  The cake is dry and tasteless!!  It does not cut into nice even pieces, but just disintegrates into dry crumbs. Tastes like sawdust. Very disappointed. PS:  I wrote this yesterday....here is an update....I awoke this AM with diarrhea...only me, and no one else in the family ate the cake....coincidence??"
1.0,VERY Healthy...If U can eat...,OMG! This product is Soooo healthy BUT...It probably isn't so healthy if U can't stomach them! These noodles are just short of Gross! And to some they will indeed be way beyond Gross! I can eat just about ANYTHING...but these noodles surely slowed me down! They are like clear jello noodles...no taste except a little fishy...but the consistency is...well...GROSS! They are hard to disguise but I am trying! I cover them with a very tasty vodka spaghetti sauce...this is the only way that I have been able to eat them so far. If U purchase these...good luck! U'r gonna need it! The soy version of the shirataki noodles are much more palatable! And almost as healthy so I will stick with them!
1.0,worst customer service!,"You only know the soul of a company (or a person for that matter) when something goes WRONG. Well there was a mix up on my order. Unfortunately the woman on the phone was unfriendly, accusing and rude! Wow! How can people run a business like this? How can they think it is okay to talk to someone, much less a customer, with such an attitude? Needless to say I did not receive my order in time for my event. It is time to find a different brand of gluten free flours. Any ideas?"
1.0,Bad Chocolate.,"This chocolate sucks.  It tastes like wax, and is easily the worst high-cocoa chocolate I have tried.  Try literally anything else. I would recommend Lindt in particular."
1.0,"My cats loved this, however, beware","My cats loved this, but when I was dishing it out one day I found a piece of rubber in one of the food pellets.  It might have been just a fluke, but I can't take the risk that there might be more.  I threw out the rest of the bag after that."
5.0,I Love my Slo Pokes,These are the classic Slo Poke creamy caramel candy I grew up with. very creamy van nilla tasting 24 bars to a box and I have a months worth to enjoy.  These are not available locally and never in large amounts.  These are a good size not the bite size that are  just that a bite.  You do have to eat them slowly .
1.0,badbadBAD!,"I looked, really LOOKED for a sell by date or expiration date, ANYTHING to explain how bad and obviously old these are and there is none. Maybe, in Mexico - these are a ""product of Mexico"" - this is not required. Simply put, these are SO old, all that is left is HOT-ness - no flavor at all and the peppers are shriveled with some kind of furry pinkish gunk on them."
5.0,Hard to Find,Seems like the delicious taste of Columbian Supremo is becoming rarer to find. I have tried a lot of Columbian Blends and others with the name Columbian in its title.  This Columbian Supremo is true to the taste I was seeking.
1.0,Not star struck with Starbucks!,"I was very disappointed with this purchase! The k-cups came in a plain box with the cups dumped in.  Most looked smashed or old. There is no expiration date so there is no way to tell how old these things are. They look old!!  Also, beware of return policy for this is NO return available (and there is NO mention of that on the item!). $40+ down the drain and in the trash. I will NEVER buy coffee through Amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Terrible ...,"These are the worst tasting BBQ Vienna sausages, no wonder the price was cheaper.. Recommend Armour only..sorry LIBBYs, this is not that great"
1.0,Watch out for deceptive packaging - the new crackers are HoRRIBLE!!,"I emailed Nabisco regarding their new Saltine crackers that the package says ""original"" which are horrible and have no taste and are hard as bricks. I received a reply from Nabisco verifying that they indeed did change the recipe in December 2011 and removed original salt and are now adding sea salt. The new package is deceptive as it says ""original"" but once you taste the new ones, you will know that they are as far from original as you can get. I have found that Keebler Zesta saltines are really good and I have switched to them after eating Nabisco saltines for 46 years. It is ashamed that American manufacturers just can't leave a classic product alone and have ruined it."
1.0,Too sweet,"I bought this, tasted a drop, then threw it in the garbage.  If you look on the label, the ingredient list (in tiny print) lists corn syrup as the third ingredient (after water and oil).  If you like your food to taste like candy, this may be just the thing, but otherwise, beware."
1.0,too good to be true,It was not apparent to me that these were not K-cups. I have now bought a reusable K-cup and can use these coffees in that device.
5.0,Can't stop eating them,I'm pretty sure they put crack in these because it is impossible to stop eating them.  This is my third bag and it's disappearing at an alarming rate! Love it.
5.0,I love this stuff!!,"Hi, I am on a special diet that requires that I don't have any sugar.  I can use the Stevia products and love this chocolate raspberry in green tea made as ice tea.  You can sip on it all day long and never get sick of it.  This is my favorite along with the rootbeer one in green tea.  Have a great day!"
5.0,Hard to find item,Lyle's Golden Syrup can be hard to find in my area. The new squeeze bottle works well. This is a critical ingredient in ANZAC biscuits. This vendor provides excellent service and speedy shipping. Items were perfectly packaged and I received a bonus tea sample with my order.
5.0,Love it,"I'm a chamomile tea fan--I drink it every night--and these tea K-cups are super delicious and convenient. I re-use the same K-cup for several tea cups' worth, though the resulting tea gets significantly weaker with each re-use. Tastes like real chamomile, though I have to admit, it's not QUITE as strong as a real tea bag. Nevertheless, I wouldn't trade this K-cup for another. Cheers!"
1.0,not vegan,"I was super excited for a vegan gluten free graham, the ingredients read that there is honey... item not vegan!"
5.0,Natural Beef Jerky,"John Wayne All Natural Beef Jerky is Great!  I am a low-carb, diet-controlled diabetic and find the JWANB jerky the best meal substitute for those days when life happens and I don't have access to a regular meal.  I carry an unopened package in my bag and replace it as needed.  I can get carbs almost anywhere but good protein is not as easy to find. The jerky is a little sweet to my taste but not to my carb count and its not loaded with salt. Good stuff!"
5.0,Green Mountain Decaf Coffee,"This product is delicious.  Not only that, it was delivered quickly and arrived in excellent condition.  It has a great flavor, not bitter.  I hadn't ordered this before but was pleasantly delighted by the prompt delivery and delicious taste and aroma."
1.0,Seriously Disappointed!,"I broke my own rule and read JUST the ingredients on the back of package. Sounded Great! I gave my dog one of these ""treats"" and she loved it. The next day I read the package more carefully - and guess what? Made in China printed right there in plain view. I am very disappointed in AKC for putting their name on these products. A bag of twists and a bag of chicken jerky went right into the trash."
5.0,Turkish Delights,"We purchased Hazer Baber Turkish Delight with Pistachio on our Mediterranean cruise this July and liked it so much we looked for it at Amazon.  We found the exact picture of the box and ordered some more.  What we received was a different version of the candy and while delicious, it was not as good as that which we ordered.  It had less pistachio content in the candy.  I contacted the vender and was impressed by their quick response and follow up to my questioning of the product.  They learned that their supplier had changed the product slightly.  To the vender's credit they immediately changed the image on their web site to the correct one and also offered us a full refund.  Thought they went the extra mile to satisfy the customer.  I would still rate the product we received with five stars.  It was fresh and tasted great; just not quite as good as that we first had in July."
1.0,Ruined my cupcakes,"This stuff is awful. My sister and I decided to make cupcakes so I got this to be fun, I got cotton candy and white choc raspberry. We opened the packets and immediately got a whif of the most horrible smell. The dust Goes rightt down your throat as you are stirring, and you can taste the smell also. It literally made me gag. I figured it was just bc it was concentrated, so I made the icings anyway. They were both disgusting and inedible. they smelled and tastes completely chemical, and the flavor barely comes through. I iced three or four cupcakes, and they don't even taste good combined with the cake. I ended up throwing out the rest of the icing and now have naked cupcakes I would rather eat than cupcakes with that Muck on them."
1.0,Over Priced Shipping,They charged as much for shipping per item as the item cost!! There is no logical way I should be paying six dollars in shipping for a product that costs six dollars and weights less than a pound.
5.0,YUM!!,"This is possibly the greatest dipping/all purpose sauce ever!!I order about 2 cases yearly, for use myself and for gifts.  My adult niece & nephew drop by for it all the time.  My neighbors look forward to receiving it for Christmas. You have just got to try it.  If you buy a case (can be mixed with other products) shipping is free."
1.0,An Awful Pile of Kibble,"I purchased this product from a local store.  Cooked it according to directions -- and before ten minutes was up 85% of it had broken up into kibbled pieces the size of rice grains -- yet still uncooked. Just awful.  I've been gluten-free for 12 years, have used many gluten-free products -- and this is one I won't buy again. My favorite corn pasta is made by Deboles (thankfully I had some on hand to save the meal).  I will try to upload a photo of the mess for you to view."
1.0,Can't even review taste,"When you put these cups in the Kuerig the plastic is so flimsy instead of piercing a hole in the bottom to drain the coffee, the plastic is bent. So the water goes into the k-cup overflows out into your coffee cup, coffee grounds and all. I've tried to pierce a hole myself to no avail. I Wasted $17!!!! Don't waste YOUR money."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.","I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry."
1.0,The worst pizza ever,"Going gluten free is not optional for those diagnosed with celiac disease---- but eating a pizza made with a dough created with this product is optional---and definitely not recommended. I knew something was amiss when I opened the product and it was the consistency of very fine white beach sand. Putting my reservations aside, I proceeded to make pizza dough as directed on the box. Needless to say, the pizza dough was chewy and tasted very strange. I would not recommmend this product for pizza dough."
5.0,Delicious,These are our favorite chips.  We get very excited when we order the next box and enjoy the fresh and healthy taste.
1.0,Walgreen's has 28-packs for $5.00 !!!,"They are indeed delicious!! - but Don't Waste Your Money Here unless they lower the price considerably. Rating is for price, not quality."
5.0,peanut lover,"Best peanuts I've ever found.  Big, crisp, addictive!  Just wish they were calorie free!"
5.0,Versatile and delicious,"I probably have a half-dozen varieties of jolokia sauce in the house right now (plus quite a few other hot sauces from different peppers). Holy Jolokia, a CaJohns product, is probably my favorite of the lot.  A portion of the proceeds from its sale go to benefit the Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, so that's a plus.  The sauce is a pure jolokia, with no other peppers, but a hint of lemon extract. It's a little thicker than CaJohns' Naga Soreass, and similar in consistency to Frank's Red Hot. The heat is pleasantly strong but nowhere near as fiery as other jolokia sauces. The flavor hits the perfect notes of smokiness for a jolokia sauce, and the ingredients list is the shortest of any of the sauces I own--usually a very good sign.  Most of these sauces come in 5 oz bottles and will last me a year--I expect this bottle to be gone inside two months."
5.0,Great quality and price,"I just received my first 6-pack of 1-pound boxes of these Eden Organic Black Beans, and I'm very happy.  The quality of the beans seems great -- and I found only one small stone in the box.  I like that these come in recyclable cardboard boxes instead of plastic bags like other dry beans.  I went down to my local 'natural' grocery store, and these exact same beans were selling for over twice the cost, so I think ordering from Amazon is also a great deal."
5.0,Just what you need!,"Dont even bother in trying different flavors, if you are a chocolate fan this is the ONE! Great energy boost !"
1.0,Pure Sugar,"I love Pamela's mixes, so I thought I'd like this frosting mix. Thankfully I baked the cake and mixed the frosting the night before my son's party, because this frosting is just disappointing. I'm not sure why someone said it has an overpowering vanilla flavor, because all I can taste is sugar. Silly me, I should've read the ingredients before buying it, because that's what it is! Just a bag of powdered sugar and powdered vanilla! The end product isn't smooth and creamy, but just flat and overly sweet. I like frosting to have a little body, and this is a huge disappointment. Luckily, I have some whipping cream in the fridge; I'll just whip that up with a little sugar and vanilla. I will not buy this product again, and I will not stock it in my store."
5.0,Great Coconut Oil,This coconut oil has great taste eaten alone or when cooking. My girls love it when I cook their eggs.
5.0,Magical Elixir,"This is an excellent product. I absolutely love Bottlegreen cordials.  I am a huge fan of this one (Lemongrass & Ginger) as well as the Elderflower.  I like to drink them with iced water or soda water.  I also add them to tea for as an alternative to honey or sugar.  They are refreshing and an excellent alternative to soft drinks. I wish they were more widely available in the USA; as it is, I have to order them online.  I also wish they came in 1L bottles, but you can't have everything."
1.0,worst coffee,This has to be unfortunately the worst coffee ever.I bought it thinking it will have the South Indian filter coffee taste which i crave being abroad but it left my stomach lurching .I didn't see the proportion of chicory and coffee when buying.It has 40% chicory which is far more than traditional South Indian filter coffee and makes it absolutely bitter.I hope they rectify it.
5.0,popcorn,"Great stuff! Pops and tastes great. The pack I bought was for 4oz and my machine is 2.5 so I split it and it worked out good, I cut back on the salt mix It is a little salty and a little pricy but worth it."
5.0,Cafe Escapes Mocha K cup,I have enjoyed this product enjoy the smooth chocolate taste.  Came within time frame stated and as described.  I will purchase this again.
5.0,Hawaiian Pancake Mix,Very pleased with this pruchase and would order again from this vendor.  It was just as described and well packaged.
1.0,Real BAD idea,These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
1.0,bad aftertaste,It has a very foul aftertaste. Taste at first mild then the bile taste hits. I love the Hazelnut though.
1.0,All Cans Dented,I was very disappointed!  The product came in a flimsy box and the cans were packed against each other.  There is no reason they shouldn't be dented.  All the cans were dented.
5.0,This is the tea to get!,"One day i was walking through the store trying to find something to one relax me on a stressful day and put me to sleep at night.  This one attracted me with it funny little box.  But what was next was an amazing flavor and quality that I have yet to match it with any other tea.  This is the best of the best for the price.  It will do exactly what it said, and will put you sound to sleep at night, wonderful stuff.  I have a subscription to most of their flavors, it's just that good."
5.0,"healthy, good, easy","This yogurt starter works well, is easy to use, tastes good, and is good for you."
5.0,Fantastic sencha !,"Overall my favorite tea to drink most everyday.  I first had this at a small pizza restaurant in Princeton and loved it! I could not locate it any market but was lucky to find it at Amazon and have been buying it here regularly ever since.  I would recommend using it for a 2 to 4 cup pot though, as for a single cup, it could be a bit strong."
5.0,Incredibly filling!  Low GI,"I don't know what the GI is for these bars, but they really manage to keep me full for hours.  I split one for breakfast and a snack a few hours later, and it does the trick.  When I start my day off with a Luna bar, i am hungry just an hour later. They are sweetenned with Agave nectar which does not affect your blood sugar as much as sugar, nothing artificial and everything organic and raw makes these actually good for you!  They do taste a lot like figs and cashew butter, which might turn some people off but I think its delicious!  Raspberry Chocolate flavor is amazing too.  Calorie count is 276, which is fine for breakfast and lunch combined."
5.0,FAVORITE CANDY BAR - Cheapest at Sams Club,"This is my favorite candy bar. I keep them in the garage fridge with other candy bars for visiting friends and family. I love them cold. But if you pull them out of the fridge, they only take a few minutes to reach room temp if you prefer the caramel to be more gooey.  SamsClub.com sells these cheaper on their website... Price as of this posting: Cadbury Caramello 36 Bars $19.88 box $6.00 shipping or pick up for free  If you are not a Sams Club member, you can still buy put pay a 10% premium over product list price."
5.0,la vie hard candies,"I really like the La Vie hard candies, they are sweet, but not to the extreme, plus in the tin they are easy to take with you.  As a sugar lover I find them very satisfying and they take care of any craving I have."
5.0,"Give it a chance, it grows on you","McCann's has a very different taste and texture than Quaker instant oats or other quick oat products, but it will grow on you.  It takes a few more minutes to make, so a little planning is required if you're an up & go kind of morning person, but it's worth it.  It's quite filling.  The tin cans are neat.  My first order arrived with one can popped-open and the oatmeal spilled into the box, but Amazon sent a new can, actually four new cans, at no charge.  And in many reorders I've never had that problem again.  Why shop anywhere else!"
5.0,Junket Ice cream,"This is a great inexpensive mix.  We use Lactaid brand milk to make ice cream for my lactose intolerant family members.  Fun and easy, with or without an ice cream maker!"
5.0,GREAT SPACE SAVER,"Your Keurig coffee maker fits perfectly on this drawer.  It's really nice to have your Kcups right their and saves space.  There's not much more I can say about a storage drawer, but that I dig it!"
5.0,Love it!!,"I learned about cheese and pickle sandwiches watching a British TV series on Netflix. At first I thought cheese and pickles would be awful! But it isn't pickles it's ""pickle"" which I guess means relish. Anyway, I ordered a jar and it is absolutely fantastic!! Because the flavor is so unique it is difficult to describe. It has a tangy/sweet/crunchy/spicy flavor and ingredients include cauliflower, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, rutabagas, apples, and dates. Cheese, onion and ""pickle"" sandwiches have become a lunch favorite of mine. If you like a sort of tangy/spicy/sweet flavor you will love this product. I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered it."
1.0,Fake,This candy is definitely not Chick O Sticks. There isn't any coconut surrounding each piece. The candy I received was extremely hard with a very faint taste of peanuts. I would never recommend this candy.
5.0,No arguing with your healthcare people,"What a blessing it is to have these natural products to help with things that not just any ole herb can handle. A very fine grind, to make it easy to use, steeping quickly in warm water or alcohol and filling quick and easily."
5.0,Finally,"My wife is English and settled on Twinings decaf tea several years ago.  Whereas Twinings caffeinated tea is plentiful in the stores here, they very seldom have the decaf.  I was very happy to find the decaf on Amazon.com.  I bought a bunch and when they run out I will buy more.  Anything to keep my sweet wife happy."
1.0,Doesn't taste great,"I can't recommend this formula.  Prior to trying it, my baby had been consuming breast milk and enfamil formula, each from a bottle, and had always seemed to enjoy both.  When I fed him Earth's Best, he made a sad, surprised face immediately, but soldiered on with the feeding, only to throw it almost all up at the end of the feeding.  I've never felt like I had so failed my baby.  After that, I taste tested Earth's Best, Enfamil and my own breast milk (too much information?).  The latter two were tasty, and quite similar to each other (with a sweetness to them).  When it came to Earth's Best, I had to agree with my baby--it tasted bad, with almost a metallic flavor to it.  I'll never subject him to it again."
1.0,Still have not received this order,I ordered these on 1/29/06 and still have not received them as of 2/18/06.  And no email saying the order would be delayed.  My credit card has been charged also.
5.0,Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!,The heading says it all. Crisp and fresh packs of cookies well packed for transit and quickly delivered. Who could ask for more?
1.0,Pepperidge Farm lover,"OK you can get these from kroger from 2.50 each. why did i think this was a good deal? i bought 3 of these and spent $60, when I could have gotten 3*3=9 packs of cookies from Kroger for less than 30 dollars. This is a rip off."
5.0,"Love, love, love this bread mix!","Homemade bread is awesome if you love the taste of fresh bread and want to save money. I own a bread machine which quickly paid for itself, but even making it by hand is well worth it. I was making bread from scratch but for some reason I get better results from bread mixes such as this one. At less than $2 for a loaf, it's very inexpensive, especially with Amazon's subscribe & save deal. I like foods with short ingredients lists, so you know exactly what's going into your food and your body, without a lot of chemicals and preservatives. This bread has a lot of fiber, iron, and vitamin C. It says on the package to use 2 Tbsp. of butter, margarine, or vegetable oil for a 1 1/2 lb. loaf, but instead of that I use 3 Tbsp. of olive oil and it turns out better. I might never buy bread from the store again."
5.0,The BEST!,This is our family's go to BBQ spice. We highly recommend it and have shared in many extended family stocking over the years.
1.0,Concerned about lead in mexico's water and factorys,Mexico does not have the same standards for Production of food stuff as the u s.  I got intestinal problems and cramping after eating these and chewing on the paper stick.  I am very concerned about this import
1.0,Terrible Tea,This stuff is undrinkable and the merchant still has not responded to my request to return it for a refund. It has way too much Bergamot in it.
1.0,Very Gross after taste!,I did not like Truvia at all. I tried baking with it and adding it into my coffee and multiple other ways.  No matter what you put it in it's going to have a horrible taste to it and a worse after taste.  Plus it's from a major corporation and it doesn't have ALL the ingredients in it.  Seems kinda fishy to me.  I would stick with the Stevia smaller companies who truly stand by their product and produce something that tastes good and is also natural.
1.0,ISH!!,This is not a good dog food!! if you read the ingredients they are not good at all. there is so much artificial stuff. don't believe the advertising!
5.0,My cat loves it... thank God,"I bought this same item for $14 at a local pet shop in Hawaii.  Yeah, weird.  My 18-yr-old cat has been through Innova, California Natural, Prairie, & Instinct.  She would invariably be tired of her food within a week or two.  With certain flavors of the Prairie she was tired of it from the start; she'd give me that disgusted look after inspecting her lunch.  I bought the bag of Addiction kibble the first time I saw it because it was something she hadn't tried yet, & as I was cutting the top of the bag off with scissors my cat actually jumped onto the table & tried to stick her face into the bag to get at it.  It was unprecedented.  She never got tired of this kibble; she was enthusiastic about it until the end of the bag.  Clear message there.  =)"
5.0,2 Doxies Love Love This Product!!!!!!,"I got a case of Sweet Potato, to add to my dogs diet dog food. Since we all know most doxies love to eat and are over weight. It is very good for them plus you only have to give them a little bit with their other food, and it makes them feel full, but yet the are eating less. It also good for their digestion system."
1.0,Hartz DANGEROUS smokey pork bones.,"Please, please, all you pet lovers........do NOT buy this product. The Hartz smokey pork bones are hollow and splinter easily. I gave one to my Coton de Tulear this afternoon and a few minutes later I discovered the whole thing had splintered into small, sharp shards! I rushed him to the vet, had two x-rays taken (there were dozens of small pieces in his tummy) I received some medication and have to watch him for vomiting etc., for the next few days. If they are small enough to pass, it will be painful for him, but will prevent surgery.I've sworn off all treats, and feel just terrible."
1.0,Beware this shampoo made me light headed and dizzy,"This shampoo and conditioner is really creepy.  The first day I used it, I felt like my head was in a fog.  I figured it was just the summer heat, but after four days, I figured out the connection and stopped using it.  I immediately felt better.  This product also made the skin around my scalp, neck, and shoulders feel really difference than normal.  It maeks me wonder what the heck is in there.  I recommend avoiding it."
5.0,Home Grown!,We are trying to grow all our own food and this sprout is a good addition for our dietary needs. Great price for Organic as well.
5.0,Great product!,"I bought these minerals at Erewhon Natural Food Store in Los Angeles about 6 months ago and continue to buy them regularly.  Since I started taking these supplements I haven't gotten sick, they definetly strengthen your immune system.  I can feel the difference!"
1.0,maybe use for a door stop,"This is hard, dry, and tasteless.  It could be used for a doorstop or perhaps a weapon.  If you have an enemy, send them this."
1.0,These taste horrible!!,"These bars are just terrible.  I am an avid exerciser and eat right to maintain my size 8 dress size.  I am used to eating healthy and diet food so I am not hard to please at all.  These are horribly dry and have the consistency of sawdust.  I got the cranberry orange spice flavor and also the mocha expresso flavor and literally could not eat them; they went straight into the trash.  I loved the story of this company and hate to give them a negative review, but I have to be honest:  their product tastes terrible, even to someone like me who is used to eating healthfully.  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Stale each time,I bought these almonds twice (3 packs each) and both timese they were horrible. They were small and stale (all packs). Embarrassed to serve them to my friends. Would not recommend.
1.0,NOT a light roast!,"I wish I had read the previous review before buying this coffee. Despite the ""Light Roast"" label on the bag, this coffee is in fact a VERY dark roast! Beans are covered in oil, and taste very burnt. Dark roasting completely destroys any flavors that the Kona beans would have added to this blend, and it ends up tasting like any other nasty $tarbucks blend. Avoid!"
5.0,I dream about these cupcakes,"These things are awesome and worth the money. If you're really into the coconut cake/cupcakes, try Ina's recipe for coconut cake on the Food Network website, it is work-intensive but so good."
5.0,"Great crunch, not too sweet or ""stick-like""","I tend to like cereals that have a lot of crunch and that are lightly sweetened.  Many do well on the crunch part, but are too sweet.  Some go too far on the ""sticks & twigs"" type crunch without taste.  This one gets it right in my book.  I'll be buying more."
5.0,Absolutely delicious,This is one of my favorites-  I carry it and lemon ginger when I travel.  It's good for quieting the stomach and the aroma is refreshing especially when sitting on a plane.
1.0,Seems TOO DRY!! :'(,"Ok I know how beneficial all the ingredients are in this dry food are. But my MAIN COMPLAINT is my cat (at least once a week) ends up pushing out STICKY POOP! He can't pinch the last bit off and it sticks to his butt and then he waltzes out into the living room and DRAGS HIS BUTT ON THE CARPET!!!!!!! Our healthy cat is a strictly indoor cat and he has all the access to water and is only fed this dry food by a Le Bistro automatic feeder. Don't tell me I have to supplement his dry food with wet food, that defeats the convenience of the automatic feeder.  WHAT CAN I DO???? please email me, mikegunn98 at yahoo.com or leave a comment here."
5.0,like it better than the same old potiatoes,it quite a change from the ususal straches at mealtime. we cook it in chicken stck to give it more favor.
5.0,Best Waffles,I made waffles from this mix and everyone raved how good they were. The kids couldn't get enough. No more Eggos in this house...it's Garvey's from now on!
5.0,Very satisfied,"Very happy and satisfied with the Crazy Cups Sampler.  At first I was hesitant to purchase because previous reviews had stated that the variety was not all that great, but in my case it was a great variety.  If you're into flavored coffee this is a great deal for you.  I plan on purchasing more boxes, the variety and price is well worth it."
1.0,Should not be called vegetable beef!!! Horrible!!!,"Notice:  This is my first BAD review!!! The ease of use of this product is great.  BUT there is not even 1/2 teaspoon of vegetables and beef combined in the liquid called vegetable beef.  It is really more like watered down brown gravy--DON'T waste your money!! After opening one can, I threw the other seven into the garbage.  And, the one I opened, I poured down the garbage disposal.  Sorry for the review but Campbell's really did mess up on this and should take it off the market!!!"
1.0,disappointment with this,"maybe i'm just allergic to this brand or its the coffee convention or whatever.  since this is slightly more expensive than my local brands, i had high expectation.  but i was ultimately disappointed.  this brands make me feel nauseous, plus its stimulation is weak and wear off quickly making me frustrated.  i used it for a while because it somewhat works at first and eliminate wakefulness overtime headache i had.  i'm switching back to the hong kong brand dai pai dong, even though it didn't relief overtime headache, it consistently and reliably provides a happy mood which this brand failed time after time.  to be fair, maybe its just me and my metabolism."
5.0,Snack For Health,"These are absolutely delicious! I keep these with me all the time, in the car, in my pocket for hikes, and when I go to the movies. The raw cacao and maca root give me a gentle buzz. For those of you that don't know about maca root from Peru, it is a powerful endocrine system balancer and anti-oxident. And raw cacao is a superfood too. So it really is, food on purpose and with a purpose: HEALTH! Thank you FOP."
1.0,Flavored coffee = nothing but flavor,I would  never buy flavored coffee of this kine any more. The coffee itself tastes awful. The flavor is very artificial. Now I  figured that no company will use high quality beans to make flavored coffee. Just like Jasmine tea is made of worse quality tea leaves because it is just for flavor. I am done with flavored coffee.
5.0,Delicious.,"If you like King's Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, you'll like King's Hawaiian Sweet Bread Loaf.  It's simply heavenly.  Sweet, but more substantial than the rolls, it's almost like eating cake.  When we serve it at home, I cut it into wedges like I would a pie.  The kids love it.  For breakfast, dinner, or snack, it's a real treat."
1.0,NOT CAFFEINE FREE AS ITEM STATES,"There are people that are allergic to caffeine. Please update you ""Important Info"" to state that this has caffeine, instead of caffeine free."
1.0,nothing's like it used to be,"I was so excited to find Drake's Yodels for sale on Amazon. I loved them as a child when I lived on the East Coast. I must say I was terribly disappointed. They don't even taste like chocolate and they're very dry. I had to buy two boxes to order them, at a rather inflated price I might add, and both went into the garbage. They're just not good anymore. Perhaps that is because Drake was bought out by Hostess. Or maybe it's just easier to create products chemically rather than use ""real"" ingredients. Even at that it was less than a week to the expiration date when I received the product in the mail. Another childhood memory shot to pieces."
5.0,Excellent,The Chai Latte is excellent!  So happy this is available for the Keurig.  I will continue to purchase this product.  The service was very quick as well which was terrific.
1.0,Can't believe the previous reviews,"I'll begin by saying that my cats have a voracious appetite. They are under a year old. 10 months? They can eat an enormous variety of food. For this reason I was flabbergasted that they (both) smelled the food and walked away! Then I tried mixing it with a dry cereal that they love, NOPE, that didn't work either. So i allowed a good 20 hours go by without feeding them and again nothing. They would have starved before eating this stuff. The packaging is also what got me. They threw in a couple of cans they were dinged up and no labels. You couldn't place those on a store shelf, but hide them in the box for an unsuspecting online customer? Sorry can't rate this even one star. The worst part is I have another shipment this time ""chicken and liver"" from the same company. I'm praying."
5.0,"Crunchy and rich, and makes an excellent gift","Made in Italy, these individually-wrapped chocolates make fantastic (and delicious) gifts for friends, family, clients, and co-workers. They look luxurious and because they come in bite-sized pieces, the box can be shared easily by the recipient.  They come in various sizes and varieties, including  Ferrero Rocher Fine Hazelnut Chocolate 5.3oz . I've given Ferrero Rochers many times over the years to family members and colleagues and they've always been a hit. No one hates chocolate!"
5.0,Delicious Rice,Jasmine rice is my favorite and I have to say that this brand is excellent.  I would give it my highest recommendation!
5.0,These are soooo good!!,"These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL  I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)"
5.0,Yummy!!,"I've tried a few different Hot Cocoa brands for my Keurig... And have been disappointed EVERY time, until now! Cocoa brews smooth and full flavored-on either the small cup size or the medium! I add a splash of almond milk and I'm ready to go :) Perfect! I'll definitely buy this again."
5.0,Delicious,"These prunes are delicious and they help the digestive system.  Also, the price is reasonable and they arrived in a really fast time and intact."
5.0,Sea Salt,My wife and I love this salt. We don't use Mortons any longer. This salt has a sweet taste that makes everything taste better. You will have to try it to see what I mean about the sweet taste. Its just differant!
5.0,Beyond Pleased!,"I am absolutely over-the-top pleased with Amazon's Subscribe and Save.  I have several items on standard order.  The Kellogg's Sea Salt Cracker Chips happen to be just one of the items.  My local Walmart Supercenter carries what they like from week to week, not necessarily what I like.  I first purchased these since I am conscious of calories, fat, and carbs.  I loved the taste, but the next week NO SEA SALT flavor.  I waited a month before I saw it again - on and off, on and off - until I found Amazon's program.  Same thing with the Kellogg's Multigrain Crackers.  I now have them on order.  Amazon's free and fast deliver is superb.  I love everything I get with Amazon.  I particularly like reading the reviews they provide to help me make up my mind.  I hope this helps someone on the fence about Subscribe and Save to jump in and enjoy having your favorites delivered to your door at a cheaper than local price.  ENJOY!!!!"
5.0,Lifesaver for my baby,"After weeks of gassiness, spitting up and trying to find the best formula for my baby, we found his one, and now we have a happy content baby. So thankful for that, worth every penny."
1.0,Rancid and undrinkable,"We just opened our 5lb bag of coffee and the first thing we noticed is that the beans had no oil left on them. Not a good sign. The smell was a bit off and you didn't get that enjoyable aroma that you do from fresh beans.  Then we brewed a pot.  Rancid is the kindest word I can use. Flavorless but for the sour taste, we couldn't stand to drink a cup. We immediately went and bought a bag of something else NOT from Coffee Bean Direct as the thought of drinking this stale bean for a month made us sick. You can't return groceries to Amazon so we're out $40 :(  We've ordered from this vendor previously with good results but this bag has us turned off for good. We've had good results with The Bean Coffee Company, Le Bean but they seem to be running low on inventory. Time to search again."
5.0,Great color!,"A must have fir getting a deep red color in your icing, fondant and food with this gel, works great for getting deep red color, I am really happy with this product!"
1.0,Didn't do a darn thing.  Junk.,This product didn't do a darn thing.  I had 4 setup in my little 1300 sq. ft. home and it caught nothing.  I found a wool sweater in the basement which was the culprit.  Removed the sweater and that ended it.  Find the source.  Destroy it.  Don't bother buying this  anti-solution.  It doesn't work.  And yes they were clothes moths and not pantry moths or Indian meal moths.
5.0,Best gluten-free/vegan pancake mix!,"I've tried almost every gluten-free/dairy-free pancake mix out there. This is by far the best. There are instructions to make them vegan, which is really simple and the result is actually a fully cooked fluffy pancake. I didn't think that was possible with the strict diet that I am on. Plus the mix is made with organic brown rice flour as opposed to white rice flour, which is a whole grain and healthier for you, and sugar is the 4th ingredients not the 1st! I definitely feel like I am eating a healthy breakfast when I have these organic pancakes!"
5.0,Believe the hype,"On this particular flavor: I find this is the best when chilled or at room temp, with Lemon Lime as a second.  I keep these in my desk at home and at work.  I've been a fan of 5 Hour Energy for a few years now, and it certainly works.  I have noticed there are particular times when the coffee buzz is more preferred than 5 Hour, but basically, I use it like so: Before noon, I'll use coffee.  When that afternoon/post lunch slump comes on, this is the perfect time for HALF of a 5 hour energy.  It's enough to keep you awake.  If you really need to get up and go, drink half, and then an hour later, drink the other half.  Of course, YMMV, but I've converted a few of my co-workers to using this method."
1.0,stale cigars,ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption. Easy return process.
5.0,best nuts,"I have ordered these nuts many times now, they are the best honey roasted pecans i have had, would recommend to all to punches from this company, prompt service and reasonable prices, will be back"
1.0,stash tea powder review,I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.
1.0,Shipping is outrageous!,"$25 for the product and $30 for shipping! Really???? What the heck is wrong with Amazon, I don't order anything unless it qualifies for free shipping. What a rip-off! Who would pay this???"
1.0,DONT BUY. Misleading product description,The product description says that you will receive 12 packets of 2lbs each. But you will receive ONLY ONE PACKET of 2lbs! So you end up getting 2lbs of rice for $11. Very deceptive.
5.0,"Wonderful stuff, & easy to get rid of the clumps","This is such a great product.  Yes, it's a little harder to dissolve than the fat-free kind. Here's what I do:  While I'm waiting for the water to boil, I put a couple of tablespoons of water (room temp is okay) into the cup with the powder. Stir it with a tiny whisk or a fork until it's totally dissolved, 30 sec or less. Voila! When you add the boiling water, there are no lumps at all. Perfectamundo."
5.0,Two thumbs up,"My husband eats these every day and thus we go through one bag very quickly. It's very convenient to order them in this six pack - plus the shipping is free since six of the bags costs more than $25 (threshhold above which shipping is free). I wish the price were more consistently lower -the first time I ordered these, the price was less. But it doesn't cost any more than if I bought them locally and I don't have to pay for the gas to drive to the store!"
1.0,"Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend, Coffee?","The first time I ordered this coffee, it was great.  But the second time, it was undrinkable.  A couple months later I ordered again thinking it was just a bad batch.  But no, it was still undrinkable.  These pods produce something that has no similarity to coffee.  Thanks to Amazon for making good on both bad orders with a refund."
1.0,Doesn't Last too long!,This item smelled really good when I opened it. But the good smell only lasted for about a week at most. I will not buy again! The label says it lasts up to 30 days. NO it last about 7 days!
5.0,Looks like I won the jackpot,"My greyhounds go absolutely bananas for these chews.  I will not give them rawhide, so these are great for their teeth.  They're really hard, and made up of nothing but sweet potato goodness.  Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamins A and C and fiber (among other things), so much healthier anyway.  I buy these all the time!  Can't recommend them highly enough."
5.0,Great!,"I sent this to my husband Overseas, because these are not available there. Him and his Coworkers loved it! Great taste!"
1.0,Rather disappointing,"Being new to matcha, I bought two types to sample, this and the ingredient grade matcha from MatchaSource. I opened the MatchaSource one first and found it delicious, bright green, lovely flavour, dissolves well if you follow the instructions and dissolve in a little hot water before adding the milk. Then I tried this one, and was quite disappointed, the powder is sage green in colour, produces a grey-brown tea with very little flavour and the powder never quite dissolves.  Not at all what I was expecting given my experience with the MatchaSource tea. Between the two, this will not be the one that I buy again. Nice tin, though."
1.0,"Popcorn Tastes Stale, Dry and Old","We had just received this afternoon  and popped one bag to share this eve. We followed directions exactly. You taste the hint of movie theatre popcorn, but this popcorn is not fresh. We were very disappointed and couldn't even eat what we had popped. We have had this type of product by a different name and maker at a friends home, and their product exceeded this one with more freshness and taste  in every way. I wanted to return immediately, but Amazon policy for this item wouldn't allow it. The best popcorn is fresh popcorn. All the kernels popped; nothing burned.This is just old stale popcorn. Obviously, I would never buy it again, nor would I ever recommend it!"
5.0,excellent value for a very useful and fragrant spice,"I'd given up any hopes of finding star anise in the local supermarkets, and was beginning to fear that I'd never be able to make the Frugal Gourmet's ""Slow-Cooked Pork in Wine Sauce"" (an invariable crowd-pleasing favorite) again, since whole star anise is an essential ingredient in that recipe.  However, for very little money I've been able to replenish my supply of this fragrant and essential spice.  The star anise I received was of excellent quality, and in far greater quantity than I'd hoped to be able to get for that price."
5.0,Superb!,"These are fantastic!  They are chewy, but not overly so.  And they're not hard, so they don't really stick to your teeth like so many gummy treats do.  They are also individually wrapped, so they retain their delightful gummy texture a long time. The flavor is the best part.  Nothing artificial, just pure pineapple and kiwi.  There are a lot of different varieties, and these are two of my personal favorites, although I think the strawberry and grape (which I also reviewed) are a little better.  All four are well worth trying, though!"
5.0,Best whole wheat pasta EVER,"I've been eating bionature organic whole wheat pasta's for 2 years now, and I can honestly say this is the BEST whole wheat pasta I've ever eaten.  This is great in home made soups or pasta salad.  THANKS AMAZON"
5.0,Kids love it,"I first came across Honest Kids at a swim meet and thought it would be an excellent substitute to CapriSuns.  I'm always looking for the organic alternative.  When I first looked for it on Amazon, the shipping was sky high.  But voila, two weeks later, free shipping and I bought several to stock up.  The kids love them and I feel better knowing that although not as healthy as plain water, at least it's organic and better than the alternatives."
1.0,Tastes like artifical sweeteners,"The only people who seem to like this are people who already have no problem and taste aversion to other artificial sweeteners. I bought this because I wanted to lay off the sugar, hoping since it was semi-""natural"" it wouldn't taste as horrible as Splenda or anything else like that. Sadly this tastes like any other artificial sweetener. I can't describe it well but it reminds me of very bitter powdered sugar with a really bad aftertaste. It does not taste like regular sugar to me. I am really sensitive to the taste of artificial sweeteners and I can't even stomach diet pop. So if you're like me, don't buy this."
1.0,Changed the Recipe - Tates Horrible Now,"I have been an avid fan of these cookies for years.  My family went through dozens of boxes a month for our use, taking to functions as our donation, giving as gifts.  They were a dark, rich, wholesome, deep taste experience.  In May, 2012, I couldn't find them on the shelf in any of our normal stores.  After a few weeks, they were back.  I took them home and opened them and was surprised to find that the inside container was different.  It used to be three rows that ran the short end of the box.  Now it was two rows that ran the long end of the box.  No big deal had that been all that changed.  I took a cookie out and popped it in my mouth expected the same dark, rich, wholesome experience, and the cookie tasted so bad I almost threw up.  It was sickly sweet.  It tasted like a combination between an oreo and a health food bar.  All they did was move to the middle ground where those who like health food bars won't like the oreo sweet taste and those who like oreos won't like the health food bar taste.  They are awful.  And, I'm so sad, because before they changed the formulation, these were the best cookies on the market.  I turned so many people on to them.  Now that they changed the recipe, none of us will ever be buying them again.  They are now the worst cookie I have ever tasted."
5.0,"Great cereal, great price (subscribe & save)!","I first bought this cereal at the HEB grocery store and it's priced between $4 and $5 for 1 box. It taste pretty good. Amazon currently sells it for about $3.95 a box, if you opt for subscribe & save. It's crunchy and takes longer to sog, which is what I like. I don't like Nature's Path Flax Plus Multibran Cereal or Heritage Flakes (not sure which one I tried). It gets soggy too quickly.  And if you're curious about the expiration date, all 6 boxes (arrived 2 days ago) are dated for December 2012."
1.0,Horrible taste,This product tastes horrible.  Nothing like peanut butter....running consistency.....odd after taste and smell.  It's definitely not an alternative to peanut butter.  My whole family tried it and it one person likedit.
1.0,Awful,"I got a can of these from the grocery store after seeing the good reviews here, but whoa-- they are completely burnt tasting! The spices were terrible and everything was strangely dry. I could barely stand the smell as this was cooking and I ended up tossing it; adding a bit of salt and other seasonings did nothing. Very disappointing!"
5.0,fabulous gift for mother @ 75 yrs old.,Best & surprising for mother who turned 75 with a surprise birthday party. Everyone there loved it. Wanted to know where to get one.
5.0,Dog Likes It,I was worried my dog wouldn't like the taste of this food because it doesn't have meat.  But he seems to really enjoy it.
1.0,Not shipped yet,I was not aware that this item would not be shipped until 3 weeks after I ordered it.  It qualified for amazon prime shipping and I still don't have my item.  It says shipping is still a week and a half away!
5.0,Best K cup coffee I've tried,All I can say is BAM! The flavor and the buzz is totally Emeril. I drink enormous amounts of coffee daily (trucker) and this is by far the best I've tried in a quick K cup format. The cups work fine (no grounds) and the price is right.
5.0,this is it ! this is the bean!,"Lets start with my qualifications (ha!) I drink about 4 to 5 cups of black coffee a day and have tried different roasts and beans over the years to nail what -I-  consider the best for me in price and flavor. I tried some expensive coffee beans that ended up in an open container in the fridge just to take away the odors instead of throwing it away, I tried *tarbucks my favorites Verona, Colombian and Sumatra and their anniversary blend. Then here comes -Coffee Beans Direct-, my ""find"" for quality, price and variety, and started telling my people about them . . . I tried coffee bean direct's coffee for about a year now, I used to get the six bean espresso blend for a while then I bought four 1 lb bags of different coffee beans to try to find something different for a change or to ""discover"" something better for my palate, and to use them in my saeco odea automatic espresso machine, in lattes and americanos. I tried (in order of my liking) city roast Papua New Guinea, dark sumatra, dark brazilian santos and still have a french roast bag that i haven't tried yet, and I would place the six bean espresso blend between the dark sumatra and the brazilian santos (maybe even tied with the sumatra), now again this is in regards to the ability to make great americanos and lattes, I drink americanos during the week and lattes on weekends. Like I said I drink my coffee black with no additives and filtered water, don't like to spoil the subtle aromas and flavors (of course unless is a latte). . . made an americano with the papua new guinea for my girlfriend which also likes good coffee, on her way to work and she called me just to ask me what kind of coffee I used because it was excellent. I also had noted that it is excellent for my americano but I noticed that i need an extra shot of espresso for my lattes to make the flavor strong enough for me; in comparison to the dark sumatra and the six bean blend. Anyhow I think this is an excellent coffee bean, I have not tried it with drip coffee but the espressos are just excellent, again, for my palate (and my girlfriends apparently) not too bitter not to acid great aroma; which is a big part of the experience, (it doesn't cause me heartburn:-). I hope it helps someone to make a decision."
1.0,Does not taste like the real thing,I bought this because I loved the Pongal made by MTR.  The Sambar Rice didn't taste like the sambar that I'm used to.  I wouldn't recommend this product.
1.0,Contains MSG!,"I was just about to buy this, until I saw in the ingredients that it contains MSG. At least this product description tells you (the others don't). If you are like me, that means you'll get a nasty headache after eating this. How about offering MSG-free noodles like I can get locally?"
1.0,Worst murukku ever had,"We purchased this product from a grocery store. The taste was really really bad. It smelled as thought the murukku was fried in very old oil and oil that has been used for many times. There is a section on the back of the package which says that if we are not satisfied with the product we can mail the details of the package to the customer service and they will send us a replacement coupon, but all this is fraud. I tried mailing them many times but i only got a Delivery failure notice from Microsoft saying the mail id doen not exist. Please dont get cheated by the looks of the package and the nice words written on them.. its all cheating.."
1.0,Caused Severe Constipation,"I wanted an organic formula for my 5 week old daughter since breasfeeding didn't work out for us. After she was on this formula for about a week, she became severely constipated and gassy. I searched the internet and found that many other people had this same problem with this formula. We switched her to the non-organic Similac Advance and the constipation cleared up almost immediately. I would love to use an organic formula that did not cause digestive issues."
5.0,Wow!  This stuff is great!,"This might be one of my new favorite cereals.  I was amazed at how crunchy the cereal stayed, even after being in milk for several minutes.  It was a great sweet taste to it.  I'm guessing by how great it tastes, it can't be extremely healthy, but I like it anyway!"
5.0,Yummy!,"This is very yummy dark chocolate that you sure can't confuse with milk chocolate! It is rich and smooth and without excessive bite or bitterness. It is much more satisfying and truly higher quality than Hershey's for instance. It is easy to get just enough to be satisfied - it breaks into chunks that go down good. It's not too bitter, yet not too sweet. I have taste-tested this against the Ghirardelli and Lindt bars of the same cacao content, and the SB bar is better"
1.0,Not at all what I expected,"For one thing, this was about a month late.  It was a shipping issue so I won't count that against the product.  The soups that come in the basket, there are 4 of them, are just enough to make 1 cup each!  What a rip-off!  The presentation is not that great either."
5.0,Excellent Seller,"Seed variety seems better than described; already the plants are over 3"" tall and seem well on their way to producing vegetables in a couple more months.  Seller identified the seed variety, clearly described the species, and shipped almost immediately.  I would recommend the company to everyone."
1.0,BUGGED,"I purchased this flour to make a quick, gluten-free biscuit recipe that a friend gave me and it has worked great for that recipe.  Tonight, I decided to make a peanut-butter pie for my hubbie's birthday.  Feeling lazy, I used the all-purpose flour to make the pie crust (instead of mixing my own flour mixture...which I usually do!).  Well...the garbanzo bean flour so many reviewers have complained about made the dough horribly bitter.  I added some confectioner's sugar to sweeten it.  I ended up with a gooey mass of something that I plopped into a pan and baked so as not to waste it!  I had to start all over again and made a cereal crust instead.  Double the trouble, double the mess!  THAT's what I get for being lazy!  Anyway, the point is, this flour is great for breads, biscuits, rolls, and so forth, but NOT for anything sweet!  Don't use it for your cakes, cookies, pie crusts, etc.  You won't get the flavor you expect!  Perhaps it should be renamed, ""Some Purpose Flour!""  Happy baking!  UPDATE:  Originally, I emphasized that this flour is not for all purposes.  Well, now it seems it is for no purpose at all because it is full of bugs!  I keep my flour in Lock 'n Lock containers and none of my other flours have suffered the same fate (in the same cupboard).  This leads me to believe that the little buggers were already in the flour when I got it...  I'll be looking for another flour mix now!"
5.0,great,GREAT!!!This product is great my dog has been eating for year and when I moved couldn't find it any where. Ording it off of this website was wonderful fast and came right to my door step. My dog is very greatful.
5.0,tastes like home made peach tea! PERFECT!,"Having company over one day I discovered horrifically I had no tea to serve. I had some MIO in my purse, and it saved the day. I took each glass, squirted in some MIO peach tea flavor, filled each glass with ice and water and a quick stir, and VIOLA, instant tea with home made taste. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MIO flavor by far, this is EXCELLENT!"
5.0,Smells great with nutrition and my 3 cats love it!,"What more can you ask for: a can that's easy to open, the food drops right into the dish, it smells good, is nutritionally complete without grain fillers, looks good and my three cats, who after all are the final critics of all cat food, absolutely love it. I will be buying this food from now on. My cats are all adults, one is 14 and two are five. They deserve to be treated well and cared for by us in the best way possible. They give us a great deal of pleasure and companionship."
5.0,Excellent,"Excellent! I was having hight cholesterol and since I started taking this product 9 months ago, my levels are almost normal. I higly recommend this product."
1.0,Artifical sweetener,"To keep this short, like all K-cup cocoas I've seen available this one contains artificial sweetener (sucralose aka Splenda), presumably to offset the smaller portion vs. packets with a sweetener that's sweeter than sugar. Since I hate the taste of acesulfame potassium & sucralose I've disliked all the K-cup cocoa varieties. According to Timothy's website the standard packets of their White Hot Chocolate don't contain artificial sweeteners so that may be an option, but I'll stick with mixing cocoa powder & sugar in a cup and lose some convenience."
1.0,THEY HAVE  WATERED DOWN  THIS PRODUCT,SINCE NEW  OWNERS - WATERED DOWN  - 2 TABLESPOONS  OF PRODUCT WAS 190 CALORIES --NOW 1/3 CUP IS 140 CALORIES - DOES NOT STIFFEN IN FRIGE - LIKE BEFORE NOT TASTY LIKE BEFORE MORE WATER AND MORE  GUAR  GUM = JUNK  COMPLAIN TO THEM OR THEY MAY WATER DOWN MORE - THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS ON CAN.  EXAMPLE OF  PURE GREED.  I WIL NEVER BUY AGAIN.
1.0,Absolutely vile,"I like Folgers coffee, I like chocolate.  How bad could this be?  Turns out very bad.  An overwhelming flavor of cheap hot chocolate drowns out whatever coffee flavor there is."
5.0,Enzyme Oral Hygiene Chews,"I cannot attest to the results purported yet by this product but my cats love them. Our younger male cat, 3 years, especially loves them and will gnaw on a whole one of these 'treats'. He even got into the bag when we were gone and ate 5! The other cats did not seem interested because they are ridiculously large almost 2"" x 0.5"". The are wrapped in a wafer paper like material with a flaky, wafery, crumbly, stuff inside. To feed the other cats, I applied pressure to the wafer and rolled it back and forth between my fingers to break it out of the 'shell'. I do this and add it to their food or put it separately on their plate like an side dish in addition to their wet meal and they love it, go nuts for it. I associate it with/like brushing our teeth after we eat. They eat their main course, have dried bonito flakes on the side, and then have a side of these flaky chews (not really chews at all, like a crepe rolled up tight). I have only recently made this purchased and started using this product so cannot provide evidence for, or against, the claims of the product regarding pet hygiene and dental health but will post an update later in time. Is it weird I kinda like the smell of them...?"
5.0,"Its like being at the movies, but BETTER!!","This stuff is just like being at the movies....but BETTER!!  You now can have movie popcorn at home without all the junk they put in the ""fake"" stuff at the movie theaters.....the secret is the coconut oil....you won't be disappointed!!"
1.0,A Bland Bargain,"Despite its appealing list of ingredients (This green tea blend contains Japanese sencha green tea, dried ginger, orange peel and lemongrass), I found the tea disappointing.  After ample steeping, The blend remains devoid of flavor, color and aroma.  The tea teeters between having 'less taste' than expected and being 'tasteless'.  It may seem a bargain when purchased in bulk but if you're looking for a flavorful green tea blend tea, look elsewhere."
1.0,China,Made in china.... Enough said. Also third ingredient is sugar. I gave away the only box I bought. Will never buy again.
1.0,Worst Pickles Ever!!!,"These are absolutely the worst pickles ever made.  All the stores here where I live carry these pickles, so I tried them.  Do not waste your money on these they taste like dirt, really they taste like they were never washed or cleaned what so ever, also the spices used are just terrible.  Lots of better pickles can be found just stay away from this brand."
1.0,Icky,"These peanut butter balls barely taste like peanut butter. They came up in a glute-free"" search, which is why I bought them, but they aren't gluten-free. They lack in flavor greatly and, for the price, I thought they would be a really awesome treat - nope!"
1.0,not ready to go,"think it's add water and nuke? nope; you get 12 small boxes not half filled with pasta and a small pack of squishy cheddar; boil 10-12 the way you would with other pasta, then the cheese- oh, and then you need milk- for #30 some bucks?; get a real box of gluten-free pasta, a chunk of cheddar and a quart of milk for maybe 1/4 of this ripoff; it's just standard ingredients- not quick, not in a container to nuke or heat- divided up into 12 little boxes; look down and read all the cooking directions and it does say add milk but not up front about the product"
1.0,They don't fit!,"Our Senseo makes fine coffee with the standard Melita Pod but these Buzzworthy Pods mostly produce light brown water.  Unless the pod is exactly centered in the holder, water leaks around the edges and very little coffee is produced."
1.0,Poorly packaged,I bought these for a grab bag Christmas gift exchange. I figured they would come in some sort of box I could wrap. Instead I get a lunch-bag full of cups stapled shut. I had to go out and buy something else. Very dissapointed
5.0,ambrosia in a bottle,"I love coffee ice cream and have missed the days of getting a coffee ice cream soda with anything other then simple syrup.  My fiancee told me about this line of syrups and WOW so delicious in sodas and other delicious uses. There is no sugar on about every flavor as well..  coffee ice cream, this syrup, a  touch of milk and club soda... takes you back to the soda fountain days"
5.0,Life savor,I have to watch my sugar and sodium intake and if you have been checking labels you will not find anything better than this.  I have at least 2 cans a day.  After I  got used to the low sodium taste I really enjoy this product.
1.0,not edible,"i found this product doing a search for ""edible gold leaf."" i decided to purchase after reading rave reviews about food items that were created using it. HOWEVER.. it is clearly marked ""NOT to be consumed"" and ""for decorative use only."" so this is a misleading product."
5.0,Awesome coffee!,"Stop searching, this is the best expresso coffee on earth! It's seriously really good and you will love it. Give it a try."
1.0,Very Small Adhesive Area,I had a bad infestation of pantry moths and tried this brand but was very disappointed to find that the area where the moths stick is very small even though the cardboard trap is as large as the other competitors traps.  The sticky area fills up with moths and wing scale very quickly and then is totally useless even though it is supposed to last for three months.  Poor Design.... I guess they want you to buy a lot of these.  Check out the other brands.  The best I found are the Pro-Pest Pheronet Brand.  It is here on Amazon:   Pantry Moth Traps - Set of Three 
5.0,candy,Candy was great.  Packaging was amazing to keep the candy from melting.  Will buy more when these run out.
5.0,Yummy!,"I don't think I've ever had a Mojito before, but I have had about all the Crystal Light flavors, and this is certainly now among my favorite.  It has a very mellow, sweet, slightly lemon flavor.  It goes down real smooth and is very refreshing.  I'll definitely be stocking up on these!"
1.0,Old & awful!,"I have purchased candy from amazon for years. This order was a waste of my money & time. The bag had expired a year before, the candy was broken and tasted awful. If I had saved the packaging I would have returned it. I will not be ordering from amazon again."
1.0,Horrible! Nestl&eacute; is better by far!,"First I want to say I love most all Hershey's candy bars. That's why I was so surprised when I made my famous home made chocolate chip cookies with this brand (instead of what I normally use, Nestl&eacute;) and they tasted so bad I had to throw out the entire batch. Nothing more to say, they were that bad and I was hugely dissapointed.  For full disclosure I did not buy these at Amazon so to prove I did buy and try them I include a photo above. You'll see I also tried the milk chocolate chips. They were horrible too."
5.0,Movie popcorn,The popcorn is taste great. The package has has everything to make the popcorn. Thats why I'm buying it again. Im a very happy customer.
1.0,DISGUSTING!!!!!!,LESSON LEARNED... never never NEVER EVER buY BULK stuff without trying it first.  I thought i'd be saving money buying this concentrate as it was so much more cost effective than buying individual concentrate at the store.  and it has less sweeterner which is always a problem being too sweet for me.  BUT BARF BARF BARF!!!!!  i honestly tried to dilute this with some regular tea and tried with soy milk and almond milk and its just bitter and has some sort of pungent after taste.. unfortunately i am left with 5 plus jugs of this and have no idea what do do with this gross stuff.  i'd highly advise trying this BEFORE YOU BUY... YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOME DIFFERENT taste buds to enjoy this strange brew.
1.0,Big Train Vanilla Chai is better!,"Before you buy this, try Big Train Vanilla Chai.  It's exactly like the chai served at Borders long ago. ( WAY better than this spiced chai, which has a weird aftertaste.)  Vanilla chai would be absolutely perfect if it were guilt-free.  A whopping 23 grams of sugar per cup, plus artificial flavor and coconut oil, put it in the ""only an occasional treat"" category.  Still, I love it enough to sneak it. :-)"
1.0,Worthless.,"My German Shepherd, who is 100 lbs., would chew up bones like a hot knife through butter, and naturally, I've decided not to get her simple bones since her sensitive stomach would force her to throw up. So, over time, she'll have tartar problems as evidenced on her teeth. Looking around the store, I've decided to try the Dentastix and gave one to my dog. I had my skepticism due to the size of sticks yet was advertised for large dogs. Needless to say, my dog literally ate the whole thing within seconds without attempting to chew. So, there went a wasted product. Time for me to return it for a refund."
5.0,V8  SOUP,"Here is a secret recipe that you will not find in any fancy soup book, nor on the Food channel.  Add anything to V8 and you will find that you have a yummy soup.  Ham,  Chicken,  potatos,  Noodles, rice,  pack it in.  Great for that campfire caserole.  Make sure that its all cooked before hand.  Warm it up.  Yumm Yumm.  No this does not compare to all those wonderful French, Polish, Jewish, Tai soups.  And my wife could cook circles around this V8 concotion.  But if you have leftovers, or its finals time at school.  This is now your secret soup.  Study Hard!"
1.0,Not for us...,Like many of the reviews here this household agrees that the taste of this sugar free cider is horrible.  Don't know if it's the heat with the artificial sweetner or what but it's horrible.  We tried it hot and over ice.  Either way it's horrible.  We are a household that drinks plenty of diet soda too so it isn't that we aren't used to artificial sweetner either.
5.0,Keeps them entertained.,"I bought this a few months ago, and my two puppies are still playing with it.  My pups are now about 13-15 pounds, and while they play rough with each other, they aren't too rough on this toy.  I know a lot of people mentioned their dogs chew right through the rope, but this was not the case in our house, which I was glad to see.  They seem to focus on scratching at the purple spiked piece and don't do much flailing around by the rope, so that could be why.  One of the dogs figured out how to use it right away, although it took her a couple of weeks to get a little more aggressive with it.  It took the other one almost a month to not be afraid of it!  It never fails, though, when they go for their toy box, this is the toy they pull out and play with for a good 20 minutes.  I have no complaint about the quality of the product, and it keeps my dogs happy and entertained."
1.0,Disgusting,"I Bought some of this at REI and was extremely disappointed. Absolutely disgusting, artificial flavor. Tastes like soap, was dry and inedible."
1.0,NOT natural,"I have tried a few of the chunk style foods from this company, but have found out through research that it is not ""all natural"" as it claims.  I know - too late.  In the chunk styles they use the synthetic form of vitamin K - menadione sodium bisulfite.  This chemical has been banned in Europe and the food and drug administration has even banned it in the form of vitamins in America.  In lab rats, poor things, it has caused internal bleeding and lesions on their heart, liver and kidneys among other internal organs.  The scary part is that they claim this has been the result of too much of this chemical, but no one seems to know where that line is. Amazon won't take it back so I guess I will take a loss on this one.  There is no way I am going to continue to give it to my babies with this knowledge.  If you are in doubt of this, just do a google search on it and you will find a wealth of information that can help you make a better decision.  Go with Wellness or Natural Balance.  Even By Natures Organics and Spa Select do not use this is their food.  By the way, I contacted the president of the company ""Natural Value"" and have yet to hear back. May 28th update - I heard back from the president at Natural Value who was sorry to hear I wasn't happy with the food and is refunding my money PLUS sending me labels to return the food to him.  He is also researching my findings.  I think that showed a lot of integrity so I will continue to buy the pate foods which do not contain the synthetic K.  I did find out more on the chemical as well.  Even low doses of it stay in the organs and tissue of the animals and continue to build even if they are only fed ""small amounts.""  This is one ingredient to completely avoid!"
1.0,Shipping is crazy,"$13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!?  Do the math, that's OVER 50% extra on shipping alone.  Are you crazy?  We're not talking about Scharffen Berger chocolates here and they only charge $9 for 3 to 5 days (for a $30 order).  I don't care what chocolate you buy, but don't get taken on the shipping for a cheap product!!!"
1.0,"Smells stale, tastes weak, looks like tea more than coffee","The moment I opened the bag I did not smell the wonderful smell of coffee, as I sniffed close to the opening I finally smelled the coffee and it smelled stale.  When I brewed my first cup, the odor still remained stale with the addition of smelling like the second brew from used grounds.  This really affected my reaction and taste to the coffee.  The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.  I decided to use the rest of the grounds as an odor neutralizer, but even that was not as effective, it did not neutralize other smells like regular acidic coffee.  I guess I will stick to regular coffee, truthfully instant coffee smells and tastes better than this low acid coffee."
5.0,FINALLY!,"Finally!  A GREAT tasting product that is also low sodium and does not contain MSG and is Gluten Free!  Since when did the foods we eat, all become science experiments!  Thank you Savory Choice for making a great and very handy product.  Not only is it great, but it's easy to store.  Got the Turkey, Vegetable, Beef, Chicken and the Demi Glace.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!"
1.0,"Does nothing, don't waste your money.","Purchased two packs to use for a gimmick tasting game at a party, but everyone was disappointed in the pills not working as advertised on ThinkGeek and other sites.  Everyone agreed that the pills themselves had a sweet flavor, but didn't alter the taste of anything we tried after the pills had dissolved on our tongues. Didn't ruin the party or anything, just a little aggravating given how expensive they are.  Will not be buying again, you shouldn't waste your money on them either."
1.0,Too fine for my taste,"I use buckwheat flour regularly, and specially like the one that have a good  amount of skin of buckwheat seed in them. Basically, this flour is too much like refined wheat flour instead of like whole wheat flour."
1.0,Corn?? Really??,"My two cats are both over 10 yrs of age - and they are different in how they eat - but one thing is for sure - they don't and can't digest CORN!!!  My Russian Blue cat, Katie - got sick EVERY TIME she ate. They don't get outside - so they needed more protein in the diet - and even though it seems like a good food ( I was hook line and sinker too) - it is not worth it when my cats are constantly throwing up five minutes after eating it.  So - it was time for a change.  Read your labels carefully!!  They need MEAT - PROTEIN! - not corn!"
5.0,good price for a big bag,"great price for the product.  A little irregular in the shape,' but does not affect the taste."
1.0,Yuck!,"This is the worst Stevia product I've ever purchased... tastes nasty! This one is headed for the trash can...don't waste your money on it. Not sweet, not concentrated, very bitter."
5.0,the best for big pieces of pork,"This is the best rub i have found or even made. No need to drive yourself crazy trying to perfect your own rub, they have done it for you. With butts and whole chickens/turkeys it is great. On ribs go very sparingly, it can overwhelm them! I also like to melt this in water/applejuice/vinegar/butter and inject it directly into the butts (10 to 12LBS typically). I like the keep the butts in the ""shrinkwrap"" they come in from BJ's overnite then put the rub on at least 4-6 hours prior letting the meat come up to room temp in a bag till it is soaked in then i add another sprinkling. I got a ""pizza"" shaker type metal shaker that makes the application easy and it works out great. I slow smoke often and 1 gallon of this lasts me right around a year but I use it for everything! Really is worth the money, you will not regret it, just go easy on the ribs as it is a bit salty ad full flavored."
5.0,Great,If you are looking to cut out some cal and want a great taste then go with this. I keep getting it sent to me every 6 months. Love it!!
1.0,Bitter surprise,"I have enjoyed Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed for three years.  But I just received a three pound bag that was puffed up with air.  When I opened it up, it still smelled like hemp seed so I took a bite and swallowed it.  Not only did it taste bitter, but it burned my throat!  Amazon is refunding my money and I am going to try a different brand of hemp seed.  I suspect improper packaging or storage which is a shame because Nutiva's product is really good when it is fresh."
5.0,"Happy, qaulity at a good price","Nice quality, lids fit well and I saves a fair amount vs. local purchase.  Will order more in the next few months."
1.0,Tasteless and Hard,"I think these things are disgusting.  I have celiac disease so I gave these a try one day when (after 5 years of not having had a pretzel!) I had a craving - it was like eating really, really, really HARD cardboard.  Tasteless and HARD.  I'd rather go 5 years more than eat another one of these pretzels!"
5.0,I LOVE these crackers ...,"I'll be honest, when I'm eating GF crackers I really want them to taste like a saltine/ritz or something that doesn't feel like you are eating a mouth full of hay. (Not that I don't like multi-grain stuff, I do.) I want the cracker to hold up to cheese or whatever I put on it AND not to break apart everywhere. This cracker has all of that - dry cracker taste, works as a carrier for other food items and doesn't break. That puts them a 5 in my book.  What I would rate a ""three"" is how many you get in a box. It's just not much at all. The crackers come in two 2-serving packs, which if you are like most people that's really two 1-serving packs. Like most GF things these aren't cost-effective, but if you are buying them on Amazon they are a lot cheaper than the $5 a box that most stores carry at them at.  Overall, love 'em."
1.0,Poor packaging - received crumbs!,The Melba Toast was in crumbs when I received it.  The packaging did not protect the delicate item at all.  This is a very poor reflection on Amazon.  I am very disappointed!
1.0,Soy Chips...expired!,I ordered a box of 24 bags of soy chips. I received them and opened a bag. The chips were darker in color than normal. I tasted one and it was sour. I looked and the chips had expired months ago. I had no option to return the bags. It was a waste!!
1.0,So sad it has milk in it,"I'm allergic to all gluten, eggs, all dairy, corn and soy beans.  Finding a bread I can use seems impossible.  Looks so good but it has milk in it.  One bite and my throat would swell shut and I can't breathe.  Oh well guess I continue to live without bread."
5.0,"I haven't tasted it, but...","I haven't tasted it, but my cat loves it. And he's got a bit of a weight problem, so the lite stuff is better for him. Stays pretty fresh if you keep the bag closed."
1.0,"You spelled ""supreme"" wrong.","I can't really say much - you spelled ""supreme"" incorrectly.  Shame on you. And that is really all I can think of to say.  Thank you for taking the time to read my review."
5.0,Over Priced,"I have used this product for many years. Love the flavor.But buy it at Kroger's, it is one third the cost. Mexene Original Chili Powder Seasoning - 2 oz  It is a 3 oz jar."
1.0,Boycott palm oil.,"I recommend boycotting all products containing palm oil.  This is not a healthy oil.  Also, palm plantations are responsible for the destruction of orangutan habitats.  Yes, even organic palm oil contributes to this.  The most important thing you can do to help protect orangutans from extinction is to boycott all products which contain palm oil."
1.0,Roland Pesto is crapola!,"Let me just say up front that if I am hungry i will eat about anything.  This Pesto (without any pine nuts) is terrible.  Save you money.  It had good reviews and since I live in the Baja I thought i would try it since it had such good reviews and we can not buy this sort of stuff here where I live.  Honestly, save you money.  There is not really a ""Pesto flavor"" with this product and it has a rancid sort of ""off"" taste to it.  Six very small (3 oz) jars are over $20.00.  It is fairly ""pricey"" to start with and since it has a terrible taste then it is ridiculously priced in my opinion.  I am so irritated i bought this crapola and of course Amazon will not accept a return on it.  My reccomendation is the Classico brand ""Traditional Basil Pesto sauce and spread"".  I paid, i believe $2.00 a jar for the Classico brand of pesto on sale at a WalMart.  The jar size is 8.1 oz and i had five large meals with the Classico pesto sauce which has a wonderful flavor.  I boiled some Johnsonville sausage in a pan and afterwards boiled my pasta in the same pan of sausage water.  Had the Classico Brand of pesto with my pasta and the flavor was wonderful!  The Classico Pesto sauce was incredible on the sliced sausage.  So i tried to duplicte the same meal with the Roland Petso sauce and i barely ate half of it and tossed the rest.  I won't be eating the remainder of this RolandPestoCrapola.  I realize that individual tastes vary greatly but I can NOT imagine anyone choosing the Roland Pesto."
1.0,Horribly bitter and unpleasant,"Very bitter, unpleasant coffee that reminds me of instant coffee. Barely drinkable even with a ton of milk and sugar. I would not purchase it (I got a few free pods when I bought my Tassimo used)."
5.0,This drink will blow your mind!!,"If you love coconut water, and you love coffee, then this drink will blow your mind.  It's amazingly delicious, not too sweet and has the yummy somewhat nutty flavor you love in coconut water.  I could literally drink a case of this a day, if my budget would allow it.  I haven't tried it as a mixer yet, but it's on the agenda.  I'm sure this would taste awesome with some Bailey's or Kahlua!!"
1.0,"Weak, not good chai tea.","I tried several of the varities to pad my orders, including the Kona Coast Chai, Lahaina Spice and Hawaiian Breakfast.  Lahaina Spice is the best of the three, and it is between 2 and 3 stars. It is not real Chai tea, but a Hawaiian version of it.  If you need something to pad an order for Free Shipping, consider the Lahaina Spice. The other 2 varities taste like Lipton black tea."
1.0,Red Barn Bully Stick,"So this item is decribed as a red barn bully sticks - sticks not stick - is is only 1 stick.  The price with shipping comes out to $10.63 for 1 bully stick, not worth it.  It has the worst smell ever I actually took it from my dog and threw it away.  Beware this item is garbage"
1.0,I never got it,I never got the product and complained about the non receipt.  so i bought some in the store. klefje lskejfewl lsfjewldf
1.0,Coffee was old and in a big clump,"This coffee arrived fast but when I went to shake the cup it was a big hard ball... they were all like that, I guess they are old and almost expired...This item is non returnable so I am just out the money. Don't buy from this seller."
5.0,Even My Two Year Old Loved It!,"I was a little be leary of buying this after having tried the Annie's whole wheat shell macaroni and cheese which we thought was just horrible.  This macaroni, however, tasted wonderful!  I think that this has a lot more flavor than the Kraft macaroni and it's so much better for you too!  At first, my two year old would not try it as it was not the yellow color of the Kraft macaroni.  So, I added a little bit of orange food coloring (the sauce is white so any color would work perfectly) and he was so excited about orange macaroni that he gobbled it right up, telling me repeatedly how yummy it was.  I think we can have some fun mixing up the colors in the future.  I would highly recommend this!"
1.0,Not as represented,"When I received my order for this item (Bulgur Wheat, Light, 1 lb., from Barry Farm), it wasn't the light bulgur wheat with the hulls removed as illustrated, but the dark version with the hulls not removed. I rated it one star because the product was not as represented and because Barry Farms did not respond to my request to return it. It's OK if you want the brown bulgur wheat."
5.0,The best candy ever!,I have always been a big fan of these and I will be back for more!!!
5.0,Awesome stuff!! Great for animals too!,I had been searching for quite sometime for affordable rice bran oil and this was the most reasonable Ive found and its great. My horse ver recommended 4oz. a day of this oil for my horse to help him gain weight. Worked wonders. He is now at perfect weight and it also helped with muscle and his coat looks soo shiny and healthy. great product can use for dogs and cats too to promote weight gain or help with coats. Tried cooking up my tofu with this also and it tasted really good. all around great stuff.
5.0,Tucson is tasty!,"This is one of my favorite Chartreuse blends. It is soothing and a bit minty. Great for afternoon or after dinner. Yummy! Chartreuse Organic Tea Tucson Bold Organic Loose Leaf Herbal Tea, 2.54-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2) "
5.0,Powers,Apparently every third case consumed contains a secret power stick of gum that if chewed for 30 minutes straight gives you a random ability.  Who knew that excessive sweating was a superpower!
5.0,Replaced Starbucks as my all time favorite!,"When I got my Keurig, I couldn't wait to get my favorite Starbucks coffee in K Cups. When I saw this, I liked the design of the cup and the price is much better too. I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to ""wake up and smell the coffee!"" :)"
1.0,Artificial taste...unnatural,"Tried this drink because it was on sale here at Amazon and decided to buy it after the two 5-star reviews.  There's a reason why there is only 2 reviews.  It's horrible.  There's nothing natural tasting about this stuff.  Stick with the natural coconut, it's organic, it's much better tasting, and it's cheaper.  I brought a bottle to my tennis match.  Was winning the match until I cracked open this bottle.  It was so horrible that I ended losing my match because I rather get dehydrated than drink this stuff.  Had friends try it for second opinion and they agreed.  Buy at your own risk..."
1.0,so sadly disappointed,Bought this for my one year annivsary and was trying to guve it the benifit of the doubt. please dont make the same mistake. does not come with what is listed and i evwn went to main site so falsly shown. Stay away!!! Thank god amazon kicks butt i got a full refund.
5.0,Amazing :3,"My friend, Kim, from Sweden sent me a 200g bar of this stuff a couple days ago, it disappeared so fast, people kept begging me for more! :P It makes the chocolate around here taste terrible ><!"
1.0,Far from perfect,"Purchased a 3 pack of this brine mix.  Followed the directions to the ""T"" and the turkey came out almost too salty to eat.  I do not recommend this product, however their bags are great for brining and well worth it.  We don't cook turkey very often and its usually for a special holiday occassion and I just won't risk ruining another feast by trying this stuff again."
5.0,Thanks.,We ordered this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas. He is ill and can't leave the house. The order arrives on time every month and is in perfect condition. This is the only cereal that he will eat and it makes us feel good to know that he will have it even when we aren't able to go shopping for him. Thank you.
1.0,"""Original""? Hardly","The true ""original"" is the UK version, which contains malt vinegar and spirit vinegar. This product is the US version, which contains distilled white vinegar instead. I've compared both versions side by side and found that it's even possible to _smell_ the difference. As you may well imagine, the difference in taste is considerable.  Please note that this issue is entirely separate from the matter of the high-fructose corn syrup mentioned in so many other reviews. The US version no longer contains HFCS, but it's still not the ""original"" -- and it's not as pungent and strongly flavored as the true UK original.  Use the UK version (with the orange label) and accept no substitutes. Especially when they lie and claim to be ""original."""
5.0,"Not as sweet, but more flavor!","I originally came across this item because I LOVE coconut flavor, however I quickly realized that  Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar  doesn't actually TASTE like coconut. It does, however, have more flavor than regular cane sugar with a hint of caramel.   Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar  is excellent in coffee or tea and can be used in recipes, however the results will differ slightly from those made with white sugar. Coconut sugar is more mild so deserts may come out a bit mellow (less sweet) and processed white sugar may be preferable where a white/light color is desired. Just this evening we made tapioca pudding and, while I'm quite pleased with the results, it's definitely different than mom used to make.  It's also worth noting that the (6) 16-Ounce packages mean you can buy in bulk without having to open a large quantity at once.  Pros: - Low glycemic index (35) - Safe for diabetics - Rich ""caramel"" flavor - Not highly processed - Possible source of potassium, magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin B1, B2, B3, and B6  Cons: - Sweetness may vary and be less strong - May result in different appearance than traditional white sugar  Overall, I give  Madhava Organic Blonde Coconut Sugar  five stars as it's an excellent product for a great price."
5.0,"Baby loves it, simple to use, lasts 24 hours after opening","Not sure if it was the baby's mood, but whenever we feed her this food, she eats every last drop - loves it.  The food combinations chosen for baby foods boggle me.  Juicy Pear and Garden Greens just don't seem like a palatable combination, but it's a winner.  As with other pouch foods, this lasts 24 hours after opening when refrigerated.  My only complaint - the pouches are just placed in a box - no padding, etc. Of the two boxes, one pouch had opened up and partially drained into the box. It had the inevitable rotten vegetable smell when opening.  Tossed out the open pack, checked the rest. Washed them all of the sticky, greenish mess.  So if you order a couple of boxes, open then up and inspect for leaks!"
1.0,Not very strong,"I ordered this not realizing it was decaf. The coffee is not exactly robust.  I like the Barista and Starbucks French Roast, Italian Roast, etc.  This coffee was kind of blah.  I know it is decaf but still not much flavor.  I also did not realize that you could not return this item.  So be careful when ordering because if you are not happy you will just have to throw it out."
5.0,"My hubby's favorite ""go to"" coffee!",Been using my Keurig for a year now... every morning without fail and this flavor is my hubby's favorite... just a perfect blend of flavors...good and robust yet with just the right amount of Hazelnut... I use the subscribe and save feature and get it delivered monthly..it's convenient and a much better price that way!
5.0,Smooth,"This is a great tea.  Gorgeous color and scent.  (You'll know you're going to love it when you open the can and the aroma drifts out.)  Don't over-brew or it can be bitter, like all black teas.  Just a couple of quick minutes produces a lovely amber liquid.  Enjoy!"
5.0,Great tasting Ramen for everyone!!,"I gotta say it is less spicier than Korean-made Shin, and somewhat blend.  However, Shin is the best among I have tried. I haven't tried Mama's but, the distinct spicy taste of shin cannot be replaced for me. I always add raw egg into 1 min of boiling, and drop chopping green onions after the cooking is over."
5.0,My new favorite product.,"I am shocked that so many people dislike the taste of this.  I am vegetarian and health conscious which led me to this product and after reading so many terrible reviews expected very little.  I have now been eating this for about 6 months with sugar free jelly to give me my near daily pbj fix and I love, love, love it.  I made my husband and parents try it too in case my taste buds are a little too healthy/boring but they liked it as well.  If you are into watching your waiste size but love peanut butter it's definitely worth a try."
1.0,Not The Item I Ordered,"While I'm sure the coffee I received is a good coffee, it is NOT what I ordered.  I ordered Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, but received Robust Bold.  I did not know this until package was opened, therefore I cannot return it.  I am VERY DISAPPOINTED and may hesitate to place another order.  Not the fault of the coffee, but of whomever filled the order.  Do I have any recourse?"
1.0,disappointed,"When I recived my maca powder a lot of  it had leaked out in the shipping box.  I seems that you can't return grocery items so I feel basically cheated out of $15 bucks, because who wants to eat somthing that was shipped in a box damaged enough to leak. So..I say buyer beware"
5.0,Yummy!,"Someone served this at a dinner party long before I knew I should be eating gluten-free, and it was delicious - the same great taste as regular pasta but without the starchy fullness.  Now it's all I serve, even to guests, and some of them have begun eating it, although they could eat regular pasta if they desired.  This just tastes so good!  For those of us who DO have to eat gluten-free, it's a God-send.  All the pastas in this brand are just as good.  Try them!"
1.0,Organic tomatoes in a BPA lined can! Why?!,"I used to buy two cans of this sauce every week because it was affordable, tastes good and organically grown. I was shocked when I learned that the cans are lined with Bisphenol A (BPA)! I called the company directly and they confirmed this. I can't understand why they would use organic tomatoes and then package them this way. I told them that until they change this I would no longer buy their products. In the meantime I switched to Newman's Own organic sauce in a jar. Granted it's not fat-free but I'd rather have some olive oil than BPA.  Muir Glen please change your packaging!"
1.0,product not as featured,the product features section states bar is high in fiber and low in carbs.  it's actually just the opposite with only 1g of fiber and 30g-6g(fiber and alcohol sugar) for a total of 24g carbohydrate.  way high if your on the atkins diet.
5.0,Excellent Buy,"This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.  As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.  To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.  I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months."
1.0,Ish!!,"There are no ingredients listed so I don't even know what I'm drinking.  No calorie count.  And, worst of all...no flavor.  It's disgusting.  If it wasn't such a hassle to return a food product I would.  I'm sticking to Hawaiian Ice flavors or the Jelly Bean or trying to make my own.  Waste of time and money."
5.0,White Balsamic Vinegar  ROland Modena Balsamic Vinegar,I like the light color and the taste is great and  gives a unique taste to foods that only using the light color  would work with.
1.0,AWFUL -  WATERY - NO REFUND ALLOWED,"I bought a box of 36 Fog Chaser and a box of 36  Decaf.  Both are so weak, too weak even for people that like weak coffee. I really mean watery.  The water just flows right through the filter giving you a cup of slightly brown water.  I am very disappointed that I cannot return them.  There is no label on the packaging and no label on the box. I thought there were label laws.  No instructions or anything with my purchase.  The pods come in a clear bag in 3 sets of 12. Once you open The clear bag you will need to find a container because they will be exposed to air.  Why no label on the bag?  I like the concept but maybe the filter should be thicker so the water stays in longer or maybe you could make a stiff filter that gets punctured by the Keurig machine. Use unbleached filters please.  I'm confused if this is organic coffee. On the San Francisco Bay web site it seems to be organic but it does not say organic on the pod.  Thanks for your attempt but I would like a refund."
1.0,YUCK,"This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. I've tried and tried,.. there are no good tasting low carb ""treats"",..esp. for diabetics."
5.0,I crave these more than candy bars,"They are THAT good. They are a mouthful of crunchy, peanutty, deliciousness!  In fact, I went through an entire box in less than one week.  If you really want to be bad, smear some peanut butter on these, and you'll be hooked for life.  I actually ordered a case of the same type of bars, but the Barbara's Bakery brand because I like eating organic.  They're really good, too, but I must say that they're not as scrumptious as these."
1.0,Finding the Anchovy in the Anchovy Stuffed Olives,"Recently purchased Anchovy Stuffed Olives.  It was very hard to find, let alone taste the ""anchovy"" in each olive.  The jar should be named ""I wish I had Anchovy Stuffed Olives"".  Unfortunately I am not being funny. Our Martini group will continue the search for anchovy stuffed olives with substance..."
5.0,My favorite gluten-free blend,"I have been using Pamela's for over 3 years and love it! The only thing I don't like it for is pancakes, ironically. They seem to come out heavy and doughy. I love Bob's Red Mill pancake mix better. But for everything else I love Pamela's. I make lemon bars, pumpkin bread and muffins, orange chocolate-chip scones, the chocolate chip cookies on the back, sugar cookies, brownies, and lots more. I have never had a bad result, and often my family can't tell any difference between these and wheat-based baked goods. When taking baked goods made with Pamela's people often ask for recipes not even knowing they are gluten-free. One gluten-eating person even bought a bag of Pamela's from me to try my pumpkin muffins. Definitely worth the $!"
5.0,Still better than the imitators.,"My local stores have not been stocking Red Oval for a while and I ran across a review in the San Francisco Examiner that asserted that expert tasters rated several imitation 'stoned wheat thins"" as better than the original.  This is a poor excuse for a blind tasting, but the expert foodies with cast iron palates decided that several imitations were better than the original.  Since I have trouble finding Red Oval, I decided to give the ubiquitous Wheatsworth, ranked number two behind Whole Foods, a try. Gag me. They are truly awful. I wouldn't serve them with aerosol Velveeta, let alone a pricey Humboldt Fog. They are chock full of superfluous ingredients, thus failing the Occam's Razor test AND they contain too much salt, sugar, and honey. They had no cracked wheat texture whatever and a mouthfeel more like Graham Crackers. If these were intended to imitate the Red Oval product, they did a darn poor job of it.  I think they are snack crackers and should not be compared to adult food. I guess the tasters liked sweet and salty.  So, I did what I had to do.  I threw out the Wheatsworth and ordered a 12-pack of my 35 year favorite, Red Oval Farms Stoned Wheat Thins."
5.0,Very Convenient,"These are the flavors that our cat prefers.  Our cat, probably like yours, too, has very evident preferences in her food.  Ours likes Fancy Feast, but only the grilled-style in the seafood-type flavors.  Other brands and other flavors, even Fancy Feast, get ignored by our cat.  The shipment of cat food (we bought about $75 worth) arrived quickly and well packaged, part of it in plastic-wrapped cardboard flats of 24 cans, and part of the shipment in 24 can boxes.  The cat food's freshness dates were well out into next year, and the cans were clean and in perfect, undamaged condition.  The Amazon price is approximately the same as the price at our local big-box stores, but with Amazon's free shipping (and maybe no sales tax, depending on your state's tax laws), you can't beat the convenience of having cat food delivered directly to your door."
5.0,Absolutely delicious!!,"The moment you start using *real* vanilla in your cooking you will taste the difference. Just smelling this vanilla from the bottle sends me to heaven. Super fast shipping, excellent packaging, even the bottle is pretty!"
5.0,"Zico Coconut Water, Chocolate","I didn't particularly care for the other flavors, so I thought I'd try the new chocolate flavor.  It's really good and I will continue to order it.  I couldn't find it anywhere except for Amazon."
1.0,Sandy texture,"Looking at the other reviews, I have to wonder if the the box I bought was a dud.  However, it's the only one I have ever (or will ever) buy, so I'll have to judge it off of this box.  The texture of these caramels was extremely sandy. The first flavor that hits you is salt, followed by a slightly sour taste akin to condensed milk, finished off by an overwhelming sweetness.  Not once did I enjoy the creamy mouthfeel or the complex flavor I associate with a good caramel.  For the price they charge, I expect delicate, balanced flavors with proper texture. My box tasted like the caramels crystallized during the cooking process, ending up more like a praline than a caramel.  I would have been better off buying a bag of Werthers."
5.0,Great Sweetener!,This is a great sweetener for just about any food.  I even use it in place of syrup for waffles and pancakes.
1.0,Smelled horrible and gave the dogs the runs,"If I could give this food a zero I would. I tried it out and the dogs loved it until they all had the runs for 2 days. It was horrible, smelled bad, and I would never get it again!"
5.0,Right on the bean !!!,"This product is tasty and easy to fix. Adding ingredients is easy: just add frozen or dehydrated vegetables, for instance, after you've added boiling water. As the product simmers - per label directions - the vegetables cook nicely as well."
1.0,Choking hazzard!!!!,"be very careful with this product. I gave it to my 11.5 month old and she choked instantly! 3 pieces broke off in her mouth right away and I had to sweep them out of her mouth. Unfortunately, she still choked and threw up. :("
5.0,Love it!,This is one of my favorite teas for the Keurig Brewer.  Well balanced flavor and very smooth.  I love it.
1.0,Horrible,"I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate.."
1.0,"thinkThin bars ANCIENT, not fresh, dry spots on bars","Do NOT buy these bars. They have been sitting in a wherehouse for far too long.  Each bar has several dry, discolored spots.  They are either old or were not stored properly. It makes the chocolate coating brittle and dry.  Spend the extra couple bucks and buy a box at Trader Joes"
1.0,AGH!,"Talk about packing a punch!  They're not joking when they say these are WASABI seaweed snacks.  I thought my nose and sinuses would explode from the intense wasabi sting.  After my eyes cleared and I had wiped away the tears, I read the package to see if there was some kind of warning label...""Warning: only for the insane!""  I can't eat them straight out of the package, it's too intense for me.  I've had to find other creative uses for them...adding to soups or pasta dishes or on top of a salad.  I purchased these with the intention of eating them as a snack replacement for potato chips.  Sadly, not an option with this flavor, so I won't be purchasing these again.  I'll stick with the non wasabi versions!"
1.0,OATS were DOA,"The oats arrived reeking and rancid in their beautiful steel container.  A replacement order was spoiled as well.  First problem I've ever had with a food product from Amazon, but this one had halitoatsis for sure.  Caution is advised."
1.0,Gooey these ain't,"I enjoy the original  Chips Ahoy! Real Chocolate Chip Cookies, 1.4-Ounce Single-Serve Bags (Pack of 48)  on occasion, but hadn't had their soft version for a while, and figured I'd give these new, gooey cookies a try, since they looked appetizing. How wrong I was. Opening the package I was confronted by a cookie massacre. About 65-70% of the package was a mess of broken cookies, displaced cookies, crumbled to pieces cookies, mashed cookies; not a pretty sight at all. I go ahead and eat one, a little mess isn't going to change the taste, right? First thought, ""Ugh, these aren't very good at all!"" As I chew, other thoughts race through my brain. Like, umm, where's the promised goo? All I have in the middle is a sweet, imitation-tasting chocolate (imagine my surprise when I saw they used real chocolate!), chewy-ish piece of food that bears next to no resemblance to real chocolate. The rest of the cookie tastes stale, preservative-laden, and a bit mushy, not my idea of a good cookie. Last, but not least, while cookies are purely junk food, the calories for these horrible cookies are 150 for two, which comes out to 75 calories for a rather small cookie (about 2 inches in diameter)! As I always say, ""If I'm going to put junk into my body, I want it to taste good."" These do not."
5.0,DELICIOUS!!!!  I LOVE THIS TEA,This is the best tea that I have ever had.  The creamy spicy taste is not only FANTASTIC but it smells soooooo good.  It's so hard to find in my city so I order it online.  I just wish that I could get the large canisters but it's no big deal.  I'll take it any way that I can  get it.  I LOVE IT!!!

We can eat our fill of ""PB & J"" this way as well as use it for baking and cooking.  It is creamy, with the same consistency of peanut butter.  The 5 pound tub makes it more economical for our family.  Even if you are not trying to avoid an allergy, I highly recommend this product."
1.0,Oh No... It's Splenda,"Was excited that I could get the chocolate taste without all the sugar! It arrived, I made a cup and was disappointed with the STRONG artificial sweetener ""aftertaste"". I immediately began searching the label to find out what had been used to make it so ""sweet"". I found nothing about a sweetner on the individual packages but aha! on the side of the box I found the culprit: sucralose. I'll have to keep searching because I won't be buying this product again."
1.0,Very disappointed - broken package poor flavor,"I drink tea every day. When my regular English Breakfast stock ran out, I ordered this item based on Amazon user reviews, which have always been reliable. How disappointed I was!  The package I bought is sold by ""MarJam LLC"", the larger outside box came in perfect shape. However when I opened it, the two tea boxes inside looked crushed and broken in corners. It was clear they were already broken before being put into the delivery box, it's hard to believe somebody will knowingly ship crushed boxes to customers. As I tried to clean up the tapes and wrapping, dark tea power made a complete mess in the kitchen.  At that point I was still hopeful, after all it's the tea not the packaging we buy. Unfortunately the first taste didn't do much for me, it was nothing special, less flavorful than a lot of regular brands. There were two things that should serve as indicators: 1) I looked at the expiry date it's in 2011, no manufacturing date shown; 2) Each large thin paper box holds 240 loose bags, compared to some other brands that have much better packaging to preserve the flavor. The regular 48 bag box I buy has two foil packs inside.  To summarize, I got two big crushed boxes for a total of 480 loose tea bags, some of them are in power form no longer contained in bags. They lack flavor as of now. Unless I drink them in a few months, they will expire in 2011.  I couldn't have been more disappointed."
1.0,You've got to be kidding me!,"Where did they get the picture for the front of the box? Certainly not from their own product--it doesn't look anything like the picture. A very disappointing product from a taste and texture point of view as well. Who tastes this stuff and says ""yeah, that's what we were trying to make, let's sell that"" Out of their minds!"
1.0,Dog Treats,"My dogs like these treats.  However, they were purchased as ""made in USA,"" and they were made in China.  Therefore, I will not be purchasing any dog treats of any kind from Amazon because I consider this false advertising."
5.0,Good taste,I discovered these at my local Trader Joe's but then they stopped carrying them.  I hunted and located them under their original 'colors'.  They make a very tasty vegetable broth - carrot and onion flavors are not too strong as in some other broths.
5.0,Keeps dogs out of mischief,"I just fostered a dog a few days ago, and he loves this toy.  It definitely keeps him distracted in his grate when I'm either at school or work.  I would however recommend you keep an eye on your dog when he plays with this.  Mine finds it enjoyable to toss across my hardwood floor which creates a lot of noise and can also scratch the flooring.  Ultimately, I would strongly recommend this for all dogs.  Some treats have a filling that is very sticky and can cause the dog to choke, this dose not, and I don't have to worry about his safety when I'm away from him."
5.0,For Coffee Snobs,When I first tried this coffee all others became tasteless and acidic. I couldn't find it anywhere in the US in any store or cafeteria. They lost a lot!
5.0,Blackened Salmon-Yum Yum,"While not a big fan of salmon (I prefer the Crown Prince lump crab meat for crab cakes), I have been buying this product for a few years, mostly making salmon patties and occasionally eating it out of the can when lazy and hungry.  I recently found a great tasting blackened seasoning recipe via Google search (Tom's Blackened Seasoning recipe) and made it up. I then made my patties as usual but did not put on the usual seasoned breadcrumbs. Instead I used the blackened seasoning top and bottom (I bake it, less fat). It was terrific! I cannot wait for my next salmon meal! Best yet, I no longer need to get my blackened kick from eating red fish at the restaurant:)"
5.0,Delicious,This is by far the best tea I've ever tasted.  I love the blend it as and it is very light.  Anyone I had taste it really likes it.
5.0,Delicious,Perfect for crepes! It's not a peanut butter taste- it's actually hazelnut which is more delicious. We put on bread for breakfast.
5.0,Best tea in the market so far.,"I came across this tea at my university's cafe in April.  I drank several different types of green tea before and after I drank this one, I found myself looking for it at my local supermarket but I only found 1 Whole Foods that has it in the area, after going to 3 in the area!  I wish this tea was more easily accessible, then I can definitely try all of Choice's Organic Teas.  I loved the smell of Jasmine and I love drinking Green Tea.  My new favorite tea, after Hanson & Son's Canton Green Tea.  If anyone has drank this but think there is another that's better, please share!"
1.0,Glee gum sticks to teeth,I was lucky not to actually buy this gum - but I was given a pack about an hour ago - tried the gum and have to say it sticks to my teeth!!  Just thought I'd share with anyone interested in buying...
5.0,Excellent Product,We loved it. It worths for a good date such as valentine's or birthday! It is well-made and chocolats are delicious!
1.0,absolutely wretched,"I was so excited to find Tassimo offerings in the grocery store and thought I'd try this variety as a substitute for the Starbucks stash I've depleted. It exploded and left little coffee granules everywhere, plus it tasted very burnt and sour. No amount of milk could mask the awful taste. My mom and husband concurred. It's just bad. If this is the best Tassimo can come up with, I'm definitely retiring this system and going back to an old school brew..."
5.0,Tastes like a real cup of coffee,"Double Black Diamond Kcups are the nearest I have found to the Starbucks Tassimos Pods that are no longer available (maybe even a little stronger). If you like strong coffee that tastes like you spent $3, get these bad boys! If you like watered down, mild coffee I would stay away."
5.0,Delicious!,"I just happened on a jar of this in our local Marshall's.  So happy to have found it on Amazon and know that I can always buy it.  We've eaten it with chips, crackers and on Italian bread.  It's got a wonderful consistency and taste.  Haven't tried it mixed with anything else because I only had one jar until now and never found another until looking on here.  Try it, you won't be sorry!"
1.0,Dont buy,It came broken in pieces. The ribbon was dull and useless. I had to just throw away i don't recommend to anyone
1.0,Not Worth Your Money or Time,"I bought these on an impulse at the store, thinking they would be amazing. I had tried toasts and crackers similar to this brand (in theory).  They were horrid, I couldn't eat them by themselves, and they were too hard, crumbly, and over flavored. I attempted to eat them with laughing cow cheese spread and it didn't work, the taste was still nasty.  In the end the only way I was able to them was by dipping them in soup like regular toast, and even then they were hardly bearable, or dipping them in cheese soup or fondue.  I would suggest skipping them, they are a waste of time and money, unless you like hard, crumbly, oily, over flavored chips."
5.0,I cherish raw meal,"Shrank my stomache. I used to eat large proportions even though I am a petite 5'3 118lbs girl- I would match the same proportions of my bf of 210lbs!  After drinking one scoop a day for breakfast, I found that I am only able to eat about half of my normal proportions of solid foods.  Have I lost weight? No the numbers on the scale are the same however I have definitely become more leaner. My thighs used to have a lot of water retention but now have slimmed down by nearly 1/2 the size. My muscle definition is more noticeable. I will keep drinking this after my workouts. I feel invincible!  Thank you raw meal inventors. Please keep this winner on the market. The price is affordable ($30-$40). I wish everyone who wants to become healthier-- to try this product."
1.0,Very sugary and rough texture,"We were disappointed.  It is almost like eating coarse sugar.  The texture is not like other cotton candy we have tried.  It is exceedingly sweet.  We have only eaten one small package, and the remainder ended up going to the landfill."
1.0,Terrible,I bought this because I love peanut butter and all the good reviews. Holy cow this stuff is terrible. I feel like I got totally riped off as it is very expensive. Maybe its good in recipes but mixed with water and eaten on a cracker its terrible. I guess Ill stick to fruit for my low fat snacks.
5.0,"Use TVP instead of Boca or Morningstar ""Crumbles""","TVP is the same base ingredient used for Morningstar ""Crumbles"" and Boca ""Ground Beef"" substitute.  The difference?  Pure TVP doesn't have the HUGE amount of added sodium in the aforementioned products (check the labels), plus it is cheaper.  Also, you don't have to freeze this product, and it will last a long time if stored properly.  All you have to do is rehydrate it and use it.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking and adds welcome protein to the meal.  For our household, this is a staple product."
1.0,Would NOT recommend this product,"Everything in this ad leads you to believe that you are ordering the entire box of bully sticks. It pictures the entire box in the ad and the ""list"" price as being $240.09, so you think you are ordering the entire box. (I doubt anyone would pay $240.09 for ONE bully stick) However, ONE bully stick is ALL you get. Also, it is the smelliest bully stick I ever come across. I will say my dogs love it but I will NEVER order from PetFoodDirect again!!"
1.0,Horrible,"These chips did not taste like lobster at all, after one chip I drank a whole bottle of water and the strong horrble flavor made my bottle taste like these chips.  I would not recommend.  What a waste of money."
1.0,"grainy, bland & time-consuming to use","Basically: a rock-hard block that must be run under hot water 20 minutes before it can be squeezed from plastic packaging. Grainy and bland after all that effort, too. Get canned coconut milk."
5.0,YUM!,"These chips are the best! If you have to eat potato chips, the avocado oil helps one feel they are somewhat healthy. And the lime flavor is great. Natasha "
1.0,High fructose corn syrup,"I had always bought Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce because I thought it was the original and the best.  Unfortunately, upon reading the ingredients label, I noticed that Lea & Perrins uses high fructose corn syrup.  I seriously doubt that HFCS was part of the original recipe.  I know a lot of people say that HFCS is no different than sugar, but I disagree for two reasons.  First, HFCS is made through a chemical process.  Second, I, like many people, am fructose intolerant.  Some studies show that fructose intolerance is just as common as lactose intolerance.  I can handle a normal amount of natural fructose, but the additional fructose in processed foods leads to digestive problems.  Is it really worth tarnishing the reputation of this classic product by using HFCS?  How much does this actually save per bottle?  I bet less than a penny.  If they are willing to cut corners on this ingredient, how can the rest of the ingredients be trusted?  Because of Lea & Perrins cost cutting, I have switched to French's Worcestershire Sauce.  They use molasses and regular corn syrup, not HFCS."
5.0,Mmmmmm....so good....,"I first tried this k-cup as a sample.  I was hesitant at first because most teas for the Keurig brewer are either bland, weak, or both.  The sample I tried came in a pack of 4 different iced tea flavors from Celestial Seasonings.  They were are suprisingly very good brewed over ice.  But, this one was by far my favorite.  It has a nice blend of ""teaness"" and lemon-y sweetness.  A pack of equal or splenda really brightens up the flavors.  I was instantly hooked and ordered a big box of this stuff on Amazon right after trying this drink.  As others have mentioned, there is one big caveat to this drink.  It is a caloric drink.  So, if you are looking to restrict your caloric intake in terms of sugary beverages, becareful with this k-cup.  There isn't a whole lot of calories (about 1/2 a can of soda's worth), but it's still there and considering how good this drink is, it's hard to just drink 1.  Other than that, I think this is the best non-coffee beverage available on the Keurig brewer."
1.0,Should have listened to the bad reviews,"This product has an appalling taste.  It has the texture of cardboard  and is otherwise bland and vile. I think if there is no added sugar,  the freeze dried form of this fruit is not so appealing.  It's as though all the flavor of the papaya was removed during the drying process.  Your first feeling when you put it in your mouth is an overwhelming desire to spit it out.  It's as dry as a potato chip,  but gathers some moisture in your mouth, whereupon the taste hits you,  dirty sock.  Yes it's like stuffing a sock in your mouth.  As an experiment I dropped several chips into my dogs bowl.  She wagged her tail eagerly at first, presuming she was getting a treat.  One sniff however disabused her of that notion and she turned away disgusted.  Yup it's that bad,  my dog wouldn't eat it!  You get all this for $16?  No thanks."
5.0,Great decaf green tea,This is a great green tea.  It has a good clean flavor and no grittiness.  I couldn't truly appreciate how good this tea was until I tried a different brand and found the other one to be terrible.  I can usually get two good cups of tea from one bag.  I highly recommend this and it's the only one I'll ever buy!
1.0,Tastes like the dregs at a bad chinese restaurant,"weak, unpleasant flavor.  Won't be ordering again.  Disappointed, because we love the other varieties from two leaves and a bud."
5.0,Fresh with consistent results,"Excellent value, with fresh grains, yielding consistent, easy to repeat results. Will make you consider a risotto cookbook if you haven't bought one yet. You may find yourself having risotto in a menu instead of pasta or potato or other grains."
5.0,Click Just Simply Rocks!!!!! :-),"This is the best protein drink on the market. I am a 3 year+ RNY patient (gastric bypass) and is by far the best bang for the buck out there.  This product is AMAZING.  My husband also had the surgery and cannot stand protein drinks but loves this one! true testament to the product.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
1.0,Klass Mango Drink,"It doesn't taste anything like Mango at all, there is some kind of an after taste that I can't tell what it is. I will never buy this product again and never will recommend to anyone."
1.0,"Incorrect Listing: This is INSTANT, Not Quick-Cooking!","Bob's Red Mill sells a few varieties of oatmeal, and the one listed (quick-cooking) is not the one pictured, described, or sold (instant). Indeed, Bob's Red Mill Quick Cooking Rolled Oats is not the same as Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats. This listing sells the Instant Rolled Oats, yet is titled as Quick Cooking. Some people feel that the Quick Cooking Oats is tastier than Instant, and when they place an order for the former, they don't want to receive the latter. I am deliberately giving this listing a low rating to draw your attention, in case this makes a big difference for you.  The product itself is very good, of course, and I would gladly give Bob's Red Mill Instant Rolled Oats five stars if only it were the item listed. I urge Nutricity to make corrections to its listing as soon as possible."
5.0,A WONDERFULL TRAIL SNACK,We all luv these every time we stop at the river or sit on a rock and look out at the earth. Wonderful taste and got here fast for our trip THANKS :)
1.0,Walden Farms marshmellow dip,"I was so excited when I found this in the natural food section of my local grocery store. This stuff was so nasty I threw it out.  I tried to use it several different ways to no avail. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it."
1.0,Tastes like vomit,"After having tried the ginger sesame rice noodle bowl, I figured I'd branch out and pick up the hot and sour. Actually, I have it sitting right next to me as I type this.  It is disgusting. It certainly doesn't taste hot due to the fact that the sourness is overwhelming. I really tried not to give this 1 star, but it's that bad. I love sour stuff but this, as the title says, just tastes like someone puked in it."
5.0,wonderful!,"like others here, i was looking for something different to use with soda stream machine. i wanted a more natural syrup with no artificial flavors or colors.  this was awesome! I will be buying it again!"
1.0,Cats won't use it,"The pellets in this kitty litter are larger than the usual ""sand"" texture our cats are used to.  So they refuse to use it."
1.0,A waste of money for us,"I was really happy to find another cat treat that was natural and free of fillers/preservatives/chemicals.  That said, none of my four cats will touch this stuff, even though two of them eat almost anything.  Much better to give them treats like Three Dog Bakery ""We Pity the Kitties"" freeze-dried salmon,  Feline Greenies, or just plain tuna."
1.0,UGH!!!,This was the worst cake ever.It tasted like nail polish remover. I had one a while ago and it was great.
1.0,chocolate chips not included,"info found on www  Since I have had a feeling I am soy intolerant, it has been difficult to find any cookies store-bought or even mixes that I can eat. While shopping at Meijer yesterday, I came across Gluten Free Sensations Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix. This mix does not include the chocolate chips, you must purchase your own. Although this makes it more expensive, you have the option of using carob chips or my personal new favorite, Enjoy Life Chocolate Chips.  I followed the directions on the box for mixing the batter. There is also a suggestion for making peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. I think I also might have a peanut intolerance, so I added a 1/2 cup of almond butter to the butter. This made some awesome chewy chocolate chip cookies. By far the best Gluten-Free cookies I have had since going Gluten-Free. My son has disliked any of the GFree cookies I have made to date, but he loved these. Other cookies I have made, he has taken only one bite, but  he even asked for a second helping of these!  So what makes these so special. I'm not really sure. The ingredients are very basic. Granulated Cane Juice (sugar), Potato Starch, Sorghum Flour, Brown Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Corn Flour, Baking Soda, Salt, Xanthan Gum. You have to add your own Chocolate Chips, so I'm not sure why this is so expensive. It cost me about $10 to make this one batch of cookies. Is it worth it? My son thinks so. They were pretty delicious."
5.0,love this product!!!,"I am a mom of a 19 month old celiac disease child. I am just at the beginning stages of being gluten free, but I happened to take a chance on buying this product, and it is the best! I have now tried many other alternatives, and I still keep going back to Pamelas. The pancakes are fantastic, and the recipes on the back of the bag are great too! This product is definately worth trying."
5.0,This soup is great!,"This soup is one of a kind. It is not only filling, it also doesn't make me retain fluids like most canned soups do. Plus that, it's tasty. I will be purchasing more of Amy's products in the future.  Thank you!"
5.0,Nice Soup,Very self contained soup. Just add salt/pepper seasoning to your taste. Its good for quick fixes or when you are too lazy to cook anything.
1.0,"Italian? Hmmm, not so much..","I was very disappointed in this coffee, as I really wanted a good organic Italian coffee to replace my favorite yet non-organic staple. Although it may be a little darker in color than traditional medium roasted coffee, the flavor was very ""green"" tasting. It lacks the robust flavor of a true Italian roast, compared to an unknown brand I had at the home of a very traditional NY Italian family, and the non-organic Italian roasted beans which I normally get at a well-known coffee chain. I ordered ground by mistake, then whole bean, but plan to give away all of what I have left, as the taste simply falls flat."
1.0,tastes disgusting,"I bought a box of 12 the other day after reading the mostly positive reviews...ive had real coconut water from brazil and this is not the same at all.. it says 100% pure but it tastes like it has a bunch of chemicals in it..i havent tried the flavored but this one although it has 230% vitamin c and more pottasium than 2 bananas, the taste of this product is simply not worth it."
1.0,BOYCOTT ALL!!!! GMO helper sneaky poisoners!," Kashi Organic Cereal, Cinnamon Harvest, 16.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)   -- Kashi, Cascadian Farm, Horizon Organic -- also have joined the antilabeling effort, adding millions of dollars to defeat the initiative, known as Proposition 37. BOYCOTT ALL!I don't buy any of these!!!!  [...]"
5.0,"Great taste, very filling, and lots of fiber","I love these Fiber One Bars Oats and Chocolate.  They're very tasty and satisfy my chocolate craving.  Granted, these aren't the most healthy thing in the world, but given that my other breakfast options are either a) no breakfast, b) the drive thru with the shortest line on my way to work, or c) Pop Tarts, they're far healthier than my own personal alternatives.  They're chewy, sweet and easily portable (a huge plus for a busy worker and student).  I generally get far, far less of the daily recommended fiber, so this was a fantastic way for me to increase my fiber intake and actually eat breakfast most mornings.  I actually found that eating one of these in the morning along with a big bottle of water spiked with some sort of calorie free flavoring (like Crystal Light) kept me very full until lunch, and sometimes later.  So I wasn't contemplating eating my keyboard by lunchtime anymore.  At 140 calories per bar, they aren't super low in calories.  But I've also tried a number of the 100-calorie bars with flavors like Oreo, Chips Ahoy, etc, and the Fiber One Oats & Chocolate are larger, more filling, way higher in fiber, and taste a lot better, all for only 40 more calories.  It does contain 4 g of fat, with 1.5 g of that as saturated (bad) fat.  On the plus side, it does have 1.5 g of monounsaturated (good) fat, no cholesterol and is low in sodium (only 90 mg or 4% RDA).  The main pro for me has been the 40 pounds lost that a healthier diet and exercise helped me to achieve, and Fiber One has been a part of that healthier diet.  These are certainly healthier than my usual morning routine; I could only eat 3/4 of ONE Pop-Tart for the same number of calories (and be honest, who ever only eats even one of the Pop Tarts in the little foil pack?  Not me, I always eat both, so one of these bars is approximately 1/3 the number of calories as the two-pack of Pop Tarts, with 9 times more filling fiber).  I never had the gas or upset stomach problem that others have mentioned on here, and I usually have a pretty sensitive digestive system.  If you don't usually eat much fiber, there is the off chance that you'll have a few less than pleasant reactions to increasing your fiber.  I had no such problems, and have learned that the increased fiber makes me fuller longer than pure carbs like Pop Tarts and that my digestive system seems to be working better now that I'm getting an extra boost of fiber.  Give them a try and see how they work for you!  My diabetic dad and I both love these.  My dad has not noticed any significant impact on his blood sugar levels or how he feels after eating these, and they're so good that he sometimes eats two or three at a time.  He calls them his candy bars.  In terms of flavor, the chocolate is my favorite.  I don't like peanut butter in anything, but I guess that flavor is okay if you like peanut butter.  I don't like the apple or the strawberry; they're too chewy and don't actually taste like fruit in any way.  The caramel was okay, but almost too sweet for me (and that's hard to accomplish!).  I haven't tried the mocha because I don't like coffee either.  The chocolate is great though, it does taste almost like a chocolate bar and is very yummy for chocoholics like me!  So, overall, I highly recommend that you give these a try.  I've found these bars to be fabulous, and I stock up when they go on sale because I know that I will (eventually) eat them all.  I keep a couple in my purse, car, and desk drawer- you never known when you're going to get stuck working through lunch or sitting in traffic until Doomsday."
1.0,Poor Value,I did not like this product because I found it to be a poor value and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I have found other places on line which have a much better value.  I have had several very bad experiences with purchasing it here.
1.0,NOT from England,"My family and I love real English Mars bars and ordered these based on the description saying they are imported from England and are real ""British chocolate"". When they came, they are Polish Mars bars!! Don't taste the same at all and the texture is different. If you are looking for the real deal, don't order from this seller, as the description is flat out misleading. The packaging was woefully inadequate as well."
1.0,not good,"This product has no taste, tried doing three to four packs at a time but still lacked any memorable flavor. can not recommend this product and will not waste money on it again."
1.0,"Love the Candy, Bad Provider",Shockers are my favorite candy.  The candy was very stale.  I will not be buying from this store again.  Be warned.
1.0,"Bland, dry","There wasn't anything I liked about this cornbread.  It had a bitter taste and very little flavor. It was also very dry. The directions seemed a little fussy. All the ingredients had to be at room temperature. The pan had to be ""gray, nonstick.""  I usually like Bob's Red Mill products, but I will not buy this cornbread again."
5.0,Easy way to go green,"Strong and durable, these bags are an easy way to lessen my environmental impact.  I use them for composting as well as for general trash.  I highly recommend!"
1.0,OVER PRICED,"I was advised by a health care professional to eat prunes daily as a means of supplementing my fiber intake.  I was skeptical, but I gave it a try.  I discovered to my mild astonishment that prunes can taste better than I remembered them from distant past experiences, and here they are available on Amazon.  The prunes are available as a Kirkland product, and Costco shoppers realize that Kirkland is the Costco store brand, or something like that.  So, I was further actually astonished to discover that my local Costco store sells this same product, 3.5 pound bag, for the amount of $6.40 instead of the $18 to $20 price as they are on Amazon.  Why should anyone pay that much when the same item is sold in Costco stores for $6.40?  Is this some kind of a gouge?"
5.0,Favorite Granola,"For years I've made my own mix of granola, and then I discovered this, which is almost exactly what I was mixing up myself. The nuggets have just the right crunch, and the chocolate pieces tend to be stuck in the middle, which keeps your fingers from getting melted chocolate on them if you're munching on it as a snack. For breakfast with milk I suggest adding some raisins or craisins, and then it's exactly like my custom mix."
5.0,Chocolate Delight,"Best chocolate cereal. Used to eat Count Chocula, but after eating this, I couldn't go back. The chocolate taste and the grains used are much superior (I think they use a corn-based cereal in Chocula, while they used oats in Lucky charms).  I find this cereal is also great for satisfying your sweet tooth in a lighter, healthier way."
5.0,Great price for a delicious and healthy cereal,Before MultiGrain Cheerios the only cereal I enjoyed was those high in sugar and fat. I have never been able to eat many of the healthy cereals out there. This cereal is surprisingly tasty and has become the only cereal I'll eat.  I was so excited to see this deal here on Amazon. I usually pay $4-5 a box for this in the grocery store (at the best price). I purchased these on the subscription price and I am very happy with my purchase. I really like Amazon's subscription prices. The nice thing is you can get the item every 1 -6 months and you can cancel at any time!  I won't be cancelling this subscription anytime soon!
1.0,Bad ingredients in this mustard,"Inglehoffer mustard contains sodium benzoate, EDTA, high fructose corn syrup and sodium metabisulphite. These ingredients are known to cause allergic reactions (sodium benzoate), asthma attacks and severe wheezing (metabisulphite), reproductive problems in lab animals (EDTA) and contribute to weight gain (corn syrup)."
5.0,My cat loves it!,My cat has a very sensitive stomach and allergies. Natural Balance Limited Ingredients helps her a lot. She throws up less and loves the food. I've been using this product for 4 years and she never gets tired of this food.
1.0,Melted,"I ordered these chocolats and when received were completely melted, a mass of chocolat no individual truffe at all!  The flavor was also different (maybe because of the melting?)"
1.0,Love item - Arrived MELTED and RUINED,"I love these hershey's coconut kisses but these arrived melted and RUINED. I understand it may just be because Southern California weather can't be helped - and chocolate is supposed to be a shelf-stable 'non-perishable' food. However, I feel Hershey's and/or UPS should have foreseen this predicament and taken steps to prevent it."
1.0,A Gluten Free Ewweee.,"Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah."
5.0,Great product at the right price,"One of my favorite salad recipes I make often calls for walnut oil.  I bought a small bottle from a local major grocery store and it was over $10 for about 6 ounces.  Steep!  I love walnuts so naturally I loved this oil from my very first taste.  But the price was not right so I searched on the Internet and found this.  I was a little reluctant to buy 3 cans as I thought they go rancid before I can finish but I am now on my last can.  I use it in place of EVOO to make other vinaigrettes too.  Or just splash this walnut oil and my favorite raspberry vinegar and B&S (or seasons salt like Krazy Salt) over spring mix, it is an easy but great green salad! I do this a lot when I need a quick side. Anyway, this oil goes well with anything and it does not taste too nutty.  Just a touch of nice walnut flavor (of course, I love walnuts so even if it tastes very ""walnutty,"" I would still like it!)  Anyway, it is a great product and I will buy the same pack again!"
1.0,Arrived melted and discolored,I had these shipped over night and still yet arrived without being labeled perishable and they had all melted and were discolored. Ruined. Tried to contact seller and got no response.
5.0,Tastes Great,"After spending way to much money purchasing vanilla flavored coffees at different coffee shops, I decided to try and save money and make it myself. These bottles are plastic (good with little ones around who tend to knock things off the counter) and allow me to make a nice vanilla iced coffee to start my day at a fraction of the cost of buying it outside the house!"
1.0,Expensive disappointment,I admit I ordered this bread with reservation. A ZERO carb bread with good taste? After a fairly lengthy period the bread finally arrived. I eagerly opened a loaf and liberally spread it with Butter and Carb free jelly.  It was without a doubt one of the worst tasting things I have ever encountered. I would rather just eat a cardboard box.
1.0,dont order chocolate in summer months,"The 5 pound bag of kisses was shipped in a plain cardboard box. I checked amazon for a shipping number to track this purchases, and could not find one anywhere.  The box arrived and was left on the front porch. It became 1 large melted bag of chocolate with foil.  Luckily, after contacting the company directly, I was given a full refund of the purchase and disposed of the melted mess of chocolate kisses.  Case in point, don't order chocolate in the summer. Or if you have to, make sure the company ships it with dry-ice."
1.0,Horrible,"I thought these chips would be the same excellent quality as the Ghirardelli White Chocolate bar.  Instead of cocoa butter, which is the main ingredient in really good white chocolate, these chips have both palm kernel AND palm oil. This is very disappointing, since other Ghirardelli products I have tried have been excellent.  Don't waste your money on these expensive, horrible-tasting white chocolate chip wannabes."
5.0,A perfect snack,"These are just like the ones I had as a kid growing up in Brooklyn because they are the same!  The apricot taste so good....but my favorite is sour apple, uhm...make that cherry.  Stretch Island and all the rest have their own unique taste, but nothing taste as good as Jorays.  We are addicted."
5.0,Excellent!,"Could not stop eating these after the first taste!  High quality ingredients make a big difference.  Love the crunch and the seeds.  The subtle sweetness is nice too, much less heavy-handed than in most products."
1.0,bad shipping,olives were sent in a plastic container.  they were received soft and very discolored...we threw out the order....very disappointed.......
5.0,Orange Ginger Chimes amazing!,"I love these Orange Ginger chews...they get me over the hump, with just the right sweetness and touch of ginger at the end...the combination is amazing '"
1.0,bad. just bad.,"I know this isn't supposed to be like ice cream, but how can people honestly find this to be good? its so so bad. i could barely finish a spoonful of this stuff. its like a frozen fat free instant chocolate pudding with little taste. there is so peanut butter taste. the texture is terrible. as it melts, once u stir it, its like a stringy, sticky, watery texture. so gross"
5.0,Extremely delicious,I ordered these because I am trying to get more protein in my diet (I'm almost vegetarian).  They're GREAT and perfect size for an evening snack.
5.0,Great On Rotisserie Chicken!,"This is absolutely one of the best seasonings for chicken cooked on a rotisserie. I bought this once at Costco, and haven't been able to find it there, or anywhere, since. I was delighted to find it on Amazon, and highly recommend this - it is wonderful on so many foods. Maple is marvelous - you'll find so many uses for this - you can even share it with friends - they'll love you for it!"
5.0,gagina,"I ordered this candy for my grandson, we were unable to find it in any store, he swears that this is the best candy ever made."
1.0,No Shatner item,"This item does not contain the Ozzie Possum character from the ""Over the Hedge"" movie.  I ordered several of them and finally had someone check the stock.  None of the product contains the Shatner character.  Thanks, Alice"
1.0,Loaded with Sugar -- Unacceptable!,"After buying 12 boxes of this to save money over the Annie's Organic M&C we usually purchase, I have learned the hard way WHY this is sold under private label by Annie's and WHY it is cheaper.  These questions are raised on this site by other reviewers, and I certainly do wish someone had previously addressed the matter herewith so I could have saved myself the purchase cost of this x12.  This Simply Organic M&C contains a lesser-grade pasta and less actual cheese than Annie's.  As a result, to achieve palatable texture and flavor by mainstream standards, Simply Organic adds starch and whey, not to mention SUGAR!  Yes that's right, I said SUGAR!  I cannot believe any responsible organic manufacturer would put sugar in macaroni and cheese.  Nor can I believe that any responsible parent would wittingly or willingly feed sugar to their children via yet another unnecessary source.  Nevertheless, sugar is the second ingredient, and I would guess [hope] that most buyers are merely unsuspecting and unaware.  As a holistic mother whose one compromise in our completely organic lifestyle is occasional macaroni and cheese from a box (because we home school our children and manage a large property including five kinds of fruits plus a variety of vegetables and animals, and there are hectic days when dinner simply gets ""pushed to the back burner"" - pun intended!), I would not dream of feeding this to my children.  If you have strong convictions about what the growing bodies and brains in your family ingest, then you will want to steer clear of this.  If this is not enough to convince you, then allow me to cite a real life experiment.  My husband is an engineer who dabbles in new product development and cannot let anything go untested; as such, we made one box to sample.  Since he is an ardent cheese lover, I fully expected him to recoil from the sickengly sweet taste, which he did.  However, I am notorious among my family and friends for having a mad sweet tooth (e.g., I eat icing and leave the cake behind).  Yet despite my love of all things sugary, this was a complete turn off for me.  When I want sugar, I want sugar.  And when I want cheddar, I want cheddar.  In my humble opinion, in this case more than ever, it should be as the old saying states: ""never the twain shall meet.""  Sugary sweet cheddar?  It's just not right.  Feeding sugar to children hidden in macaroni and cheese?  It's just plain wrong.  Simply put: Simply Organic is not worthy of our patronage.  Eat healthy and be well in your journey.... ;)"
5.0,OOO SO GOOD!!!,"Went through 3 tubes the day I got this. Its been a week and have 7 of 18 left. I gave a few (3)to some coworkers and they loved it!! Reminds me and them of when we were a kid. Its the same thing. 3 different flavors. Blue Raspberry, Cherry, and Watermelon.  The down side is I now have to buy more. The up side is its money well spent. These are the regular ones NOT the sour ones. Which are listed on Amazon. So be careful and always review the product carefully before purchasing. I almost made that mistake. Which wouldn't be that bad."
1.0,Waste of money,"I agree with the others who have given this a poor review. Tastes like watered down hot chocolate with a hint of coffee flavor. Open up the used k cup and it's empty. Definetely not worth the money for instant coffee and hot chocolate mix, and then not enough of it to give any decent flavor."
5.0,BEST COLUMBIAN DECAF KCUP,I've used a Cuisinart Grind'n'Brew for years to achieve the full bodied flavor of fresh ground columbian beans. When Keurigs came out I found that most brands of columbian coffee kcups left me unsatisified. They were tinny and weak. I have a caffeine sensitivity and can only have 1-2 cups of regular coffee each day and then I must switch to decaf for the rest of the day.  Timothy's Decaf Columbian K-Cup is FANTASTIC! I'm so relieved to have finally found a full-bodied decaf coffee.  I have found that the strength is perfect if brewed on the large setting of the Keurig. Thanks to Amazon I can get this at a better price than through Timothy's website.
5.0,fantastic!,"Lavazza coffee is my coffee. I will not change it for any other brand.  I got a superb service with Amazon.  Very, very satisfied.  Thank you."
5.0,Delicious!,Since Nissin Top Ramen Oriental flavor has been discontinued I was trying to find a good alternative and I have.  I usually add some garlic powder and parmesan cheese...Very Tasty!
5.0,Iced cappucino at home,This coffee is delicious!  It is the equivalent of high priced cappuccino with the added benefit of customizing for your needs.  I use lactose-free milk and make it as strong as I like using less milk or 2 packets.  I have even used half a packet for a short one!  It's helpful to have a shaker to blend it well.  It's a great product for summer coffee lovers.
5.0,Yummy coffee!,My husband loves this coffee and we got it at a very good price. The free super saver shipping REALLY made a difference why we bought it here than in the store.
5.0,Very good pancake mix,"I want to start off by saying I don't have pancakes that much, mainly because you tend to get those white floured dull, tasteless pancakes at restaurants that beg to be drowned in syrup, and still choke you to death. Over the last year, my wife has started cooking whole grain pancakes on some weekends, especially if we go on a bicycle ride that morning. I would also like to state up front that I have NEVER ever cooked a pancake myself. Really, never. Since my wife was out of town this weekend, and these High Fiber Pancake & Waffle mixes just came in the mail, I was itching to try them. I got out our grill iron, heated it up, mixed the 4 simple ingredients, poured out 1/2 the mix which is enough to make a large plate sized pancake, cooked as per instructions, and it turned out great. I cooked two with that amount of batter. (One large pancake is plenty for most people, I struggled to finish the last few bites, only because there was a lot of it.) I used minimal maple syrup, the real stuff from Canada, and cut up three Calimyrna Figs and placed on top that I also just bought here, and they were absolutely fantastic. They were as smooth and light as any pancake, and not heavy like some other whole grain cakes are. These were very good. I am glad the order comes with 4 bags, as I feel these might be used up in a couple of months. I have always liked Bob's Red Mill products, having bought many different seeds and mixes, but this is the first pancake mix I bought. Glad I did."
5.0,Tasty and soothing,"As a singer, I have drunk or gargled drinkable aloe vera (usually formulated for stomach problems) for years.  This brand (which also comes in a tasty non-pomegranate aloe flavor) is so pleasant to drink that my daughter enjoys it!  I drink it whenever either my throat is raw or my stomach needs soothing.  On the downside, it's as sweet as a soft drink--but if one imbibes only as needed, it's worth the calories!"
1.0,Not chocolate,"I don't know what they used for flavor in this stuff, but it isn't chocolate - and if it is orange, it is weird tasting orange.  I would rather drink plain hot water.  This stuff doesn't even deserve one star!"
1.0,Pricey?,How is $16 a jug a good deal?  I get the same products in the same size at my local Walmart for $7 a jug.
5.0,Dog World,"C.E.T. VegieDent Chews are one of our pets favorite! We have two dogs under 23 pounds, and they feel as if these are a really wonderful large treat for them. They really help keep those choppers clean to boot! We highly recommend."
5.0,"Tasty, like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup! But hypoglycemics are absorbing some sugar.","UPDATE APRIL 2012: Awhile back, some Amazon customers were having a problem with the product they received.  I believe that Amazon packaging sorted out the issue. Now when I receive these from Amazon, they are always fresh and in sealed packaging. Each box is individually sealed tightly in plastic wrap.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  These bars are very good, kind of like a diet Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. They taste so good that they have taken their place as my new favorite protein bar by thinkThin. They taste like chocolate and peanut butter.  However, I should clarify that the chocolate is sort of a diet tasting chocolate. The ingredients are natural, but it is diet. It is good for a diet protein bar. It may taste a little bit dry compared to some protein bars that are loaded with sugar. There are some brands of protein bars out there that, if you read the labels, contain a lot more sugar. If you want a bar like that, then this may not be the bar for you. It tastes pretty good for the type of bar that it is: very low sugar and low fat.  They are less sweet than other brands of protein bars, because the bars by thinkThin contain lower amounts of sugar.  However, they are healthier, so for me, it is a good trade-off. Also, if you are used to other brands of protein bars, they may not taste as rich. If one looks at the ingredient label of the other brand versus this brand, one may see a lot more sugar in the other brand.  Note for hypogylcemics: For hypoglycemics like me, at first glance this bar appears to have 0 gms of sugar, which would help to stabilize the blood sugar. Combine that with 20 grams of protein and it sounds like a great combination for hypoglycemics. If you are not a hypoglycemic, but just looking to lower your sugar, this would seem to be a healthy bar -- and compared to many high-sugar protein bars on the market, it is.  However - taking a look at the nutritional information, it also states there are 11 gm of ""sugar alcohol"" in the bar, which from reading the label I see come from Maltitol. Maltitol has a relatively high glycemic index, which is not good news for hypoglycemics. Seventy-five percent of Maltitol calories and sugar are absorbed by the body. This does impact blood glucose levels. Estimates state that Maltitol is 75% to 90% as sweet as sugar, depending on the source. It can also cause intestinal discomfort. So if you are a hypoglycemic, don't be fooled into thinking you are eating a truly 0 gm sugar bar. You are absorbing some sugar. Just plan your menu accordingly.  Nutrition Facts per bar: 240 calories Fat calories: 80 Total fat: 8 gm Saturated fat: 3 gm Cholesterol: 5 gm Sodium: 240 mg Total Carb.: 24 gm Dietary Fiber: 1 gm Sugars: 0 gm Sugar Alcohol: 11 gm Other Carb.: 10 gm Protein: 20 gm  If you are used to other brands of bars with a lot of sugar in them, ThinkThin may take some getting used to, but if you are looking for a lower-sugar alternative, give these a try.  ~~  >> ""I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather.

5.0,fabulous chips,The chips are fabulous.  Deliscious and crunchy.  Remind me of Cape Cod Chips which are a lot more expensive.  Definetly worth the price.
5.0,Everyday food,"These are nutty delicious, and well packaged.  I put a couple tbls in a fruit shake every morning and I get to enjoy the flavor, clean energy and satisfaction of hunger with them.  Thanks hemp."
1.0,NEVER AGAIN.....,"I purchased the Hugs and Kisses arrangement for my friend from her 3yr old son for Valentine's Day.  The flowers were nothing but a total disappointment.  They looked nothing like the picture, infact, they looked like they had been sitting a grocery store for two weeks with no water.  From now on - I order local delivery.  Proflower customer service is less than desirable.  Not only did the individual not speak English very well, he was rude and laughed in my face.  I am not ordering from them again."
5.0,Great for dogs with digestive problems,"Our 12 year old aussie/border collie mix was eating what we 'thought' was pretty good food, but every night his gas just about killed us, and we knew it had to be making his stomach hurt as well,so we switched to this food (tried it out with the 4 lb bag) and he's been great ever since. It's very pricey, but well worth it. He seems happier and I know WE are! :)"
1.0,THis stuff is awful!,I like to take good care of my cats -- I feed them organic food and I don't like the dust from regular kitty liter getting in their lungs so I tried this.  I found it to be terrible!  It doesn't clump at all -- just turns to a globby mess and it seems to hold the odor.  I think I'm even going to have to replace the litter boxes entirely because I can't really get them clean after using this just once.  I would love to find something natural but this just doesn't work at all.
5.0,Luzianne Tea,"This tea is so smooth, better than Lipton or any other iced tea product.  In fact the people I work with have tasted the tea and have asked where they can get it. Shame you can't find it in Sacramento, California."
5.0,Delicious,"I recently discovered 18 Rabbits granola and now I realize that the granola bars in the grocery store are total junk in comparison.  These are DELICIOUS and healthy, and cost more at my gym, so I'm excited to buy them in bulk online for a better price."
5.0,High Quality that will make you eat it in one sitting!,"This is some high quality, pure marzipan. This grade of product doesn't need any candy coating or sugar on top; the flavor itself is very rich. The best way to eat this is in small bites because you'll end up eating all four loaf's in one sitting, in a big hurry. If you love marzipan, you owe it to yourself to at least give this one try. Odds are you'll be ordering this on a regular basis. Sometimes Amazon doesn't have this on Prime but when they do, I get some. Don't get too much though; reading the nutritional information might give you heart palpitations."
1.0,I normally like coffee bean direct just not monsoon malabar,"This has to be one of the worst whole coffee beans I've ordered.  I don't think it was due to coffee bean direct or that the beans were old.  I actually believe them to be pretty freshly roasted.  The coffee bean itself I think was subpar to begin with.  It was like someone took all of the beautiful aromatic notes out of the coffee and left me with an old balsam like note (Kind of like the smell of a cheap cigar).  The taste was bearable once I put some chicory in, but without it I didn't want to drink it. If you want to buy 5lbs of coffee please stick with one you can trust.  A sumatra, columbian, or even costa rica blend would be better than this."
5.0,My Cats Love It!,"My two cats just started their second bag of Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken dry food.  In the twenty years that I have owned cats, I have never seen cats so excited about dry food.  With other dry food they would eat a few bites and then walk away.  I would end up throwing away what they didn't eat after several hours.  With this food, they don't waste anything!  They usually eat their entire serving as soon as I feed them.  It must really taste good to them!  I'm very pleased with the ingredients and I've noticed how silky their coats are after starting this food.  This dry food and the Weruva canned food are definitely their favorites.  It's worth spending the extra money because nothing is going to waste."
5.0,Yummy Mix!,Very nice mix.  They used to sell these in the 1.5 oz packet at the stores and then took them off the market years ago.  I am glad that I was able to find it again at a most reasonable price.
1.0,What's with the price?,$52 for 6 cans.  What made this jump to such an overpriced item?  Love the stuff but won't be paying almost $9.00 a can.
1.0,"Very Weak Flavor, Definately NOT Watermelon","Received 6 bottles of concentrate from Paragon. Mixed EXACTLY to their specs., and was extremely disappointed in four of the six flavors.  I am truly saddened to have to encourage you to NOT purchase the Watermelon flavor.  This item has be returned for a refund."
1.0,Not even sealed...,"I don't know from what planet these guys are from but the honey arrives in tiny jars that are not even sealed... and the lid comes of very easy (just to make things worse). As far as I am concerned, they can put inside whatever they want - there is no way to prove that the contents is the intended one or if it ever was in France (as they claim). 100% pure junk!  As the jars are not even sealed, they might add poison as well or spit in your honey - just for the kicks of it! Why would anyone in his right mind expose him/herself or the family to such low class, dangerous product?!"
5.0,Great stuff,I like Crystal Light Strawberry Kiwi the best of all. I can not get it local so I will be ordering from Amazon.  Thanks
5.0,Just Too Funny,"These pooping Reideers are just to funny. Can't wait till I take them over to my Boss's office for her and her daughter to open them up. Both of these ladie's have a great sense of humor. Well they better like them or else I'm fired. Nah, they will love them"
5.0,Best tea ever,"Great as hot or cold tea. I heat water to boiling, turn it off add the tea into the kettle and let the leaves soak all day. Strain and chill--the best ever."
5.0,Yummy - I mean Yummy Caramel Covered Popcorn,"My title - pretty much says it all. Yummy though is simply not enough of a description. Its crazy fresh too. And creamy. Yes creamy. The caramel is wrapped in a buttery flavor - just below the flavor of the caramel. And then - there's more - because you get to the popcorn yum. And then there is even more -  the crunch of the caramel - all which provide a fully yummy mouth experience.  I bought a 3.5 gallon bag the first time and did think it would go stale before the two of us - plus the occasional guest - would be able to finish it. It was after all the first time ordering and I was doubtful it was going to be that good, in spite of the other reviewers who gave it very high ratings. It took me no time at all to realize that we would not be sorry to have purchased it, or even that if we liked it - we would probably get sick of snacking on it. But neither occurred. We were not sorry and we did not ""get sick of it"".  This is just the best caramel covered popcorn I /we have ever consumed.  So buy your yummy here today! Oh - and we got it very quickly. A huge plus when ordering a ""snack"" that sounds delicious that you know you are going to have to wait for.  There is only one real downside, which is the cost of shipping, which appears to be the same for all of the sizes of popcorn. I would like/love them to see what they can do to change that, at the very least for the smaller ""bags"" of their product, so that people who might be interested in trying their goods, could do that and get to know what they like - without a huge shipping cost investment."
5.0,Awesome suckers!,"These are very yummy lollipops. The flavors are intense, they are low-calorie (you can eat 3 for 70 calories), they are fairly good sized, and they are free of yucky chemicals. My kids love them! They are also a great value- the bags are huge! mango, lemon, and watermelon are my favorites- very fruity. Pomegranite one has an intense cherry flavor- I don't really like cherry, but the kids seem to like them. No orange one to speak of in my bags- too bad, since we love oranges...."
1.0,Not worth it.,Way way way overpriced. I can get this same set at the Japanese market for around $20. Save yourself the $40.
5.0,Happy to find on Amazon,"I've loved these oatcakes for several years, ever since a friend in Scotland started sending them in my Christmas box. I've ordered them from the online Scottish Grocer site but the shipping costs are very high. So, glad to to find them on Amazon where they qualify for free shipping!"
5.0,Tastes exactly like regular Stash Green Tea,"I was worried this was going to taste ""less"" than green coffee, or have some weird after taste or some other sort of nonsense, much like Caffeine Free soda or Diet Soda, etc., would, but this tastes basically like the regular Stash Green Tea, but decaf (We buy it for the pregnant ladies at work) and organic! This is USEFUL information for those who were afraid to jump the gun on decaf green tea - this particular brand is good!"
5.0,The BEST,"If you love Junior Mints and peppermint, you will LOVE these!  I love the crunch of the peppermint.  These are a nice change from the plain Junior Mints."
5.0,Fantastic Coffee,Tastes great. I enjoy each and every cup of this amazing coffee. I am amazed by all the different flavors of coffee that is out there. Thank you for allowing me to taste it.
5.0,Halo - Purely for Pets - Liv a Littles Chicken/Beef treats,"Great treat for your pets. All chicken and beef, better than the junk treats that are on the market. My cats love them. Order them on-line, much cheaper than buying in pet stores (almost half the price)."
5.0,I use these every day,Have been using these now for over three years.  The flavor quality is outstanding and the simplicity of use is great!  I have been on subscribe and save on this now for two years!  Never without a good cup of brew.
1.0,Deceptive advertising,"It is NOT rose petal teal. It black tea rubbish, maybe mixed with some rose. A lot of aggravation with ship[ping time too."
5.0,Love these bars!!,"I love these bars!  I eat one of these with a yogurt for breakfast, they make a great snack, and I've even eaten two bars for dinner!!  I can throw one in my purse, a few in my backpack, or even one in my gym bag.  They taste good, they're filling and quick.  I hate when I run out of them!"
1.0,Way too expensive,"As a new Prime member I was looking forward to getting a lot if items from Amazon that i normally purchase locally.  My expectation was that I would get a better price from Amazon.  As a Diabetic, I love Dreamfields Pasta.  It's really the only way I get to eat pasta.  I was shocked to find if cost over $10.00 here.  I can purchase it locally for around $3.00.  They need to fix this."
1.0,Gummy,"Agree with some other reviewers, that this crust didn't cook up right and was gummy. We had to throw the pizza away, it was inedible. We had gone ahead and put the toppings on before we realized the crust was gummy in the middle. I did notice the recipe had been revised and used a lot more water to mix ratio. Something is not working right for me. I emailed the company and hope they respond."
1.0,Eehh,"I havent had these since I was a teen (about 7 years ago), saw them and what I thought I remembered was they were good and I liked them...What was I thinking?  These krispy bars are waayyyy too sweet - I probably still have over half a box left and I bought these weeks ago (in a household of 4 where 3 of us would eat this).  Next time I'll buy the ingredients and make them homemade instead!"
1.0,Too much sugar,"I don't like anything about this bar. It does not have rich chocolate taste I was hoping for and the sugar content is way too high. I'm used to a minimum of 85% cocoa content, but was looking for other bars with nuts. This bar does not have the crunchiness you would expect of such product. Going back to my smooth, rich, dark chocolate bars. BTW, the bulk is too expensive on amazon; it's cheaper to buy from walmart or your local grocery store."
1.0,Tastes like sweaty gym socks,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
1.0,So very disappointed!!,"I ordered this and the watermelon fruit rolls because the Mariani fruit rolls were out of stock, and so because others had really great reviews similar to how I felt about the Mariani fruit rolls, I thought this would be as good if not better.  I was SOOOOOO wrong! So very wrong. Neither myself or son could swallow these fruit rolls. They have a good initial taste and the strawberry do smell sweet but it isnt enough to make it taste good at all.It seemed like it was pureed fruit smeared onto plastic and let out to dry. Like nothing went into it. Very icky stuff (says my son)."
5.0,delicious,"This was the first time I've eaten raw honey.  The product was fresh and had a nice mild, clean taste.  I will purchase this again."
5.0,"Once in a while, in the short term, works for cats too","Note that I'm NOT recommending you feed your cat dog food on any kind of regular basis: the two types of animals need different kinds of foods and nutrients. However, at the time I was having trouble finding cat-specific dehydrated food that I thought my cats would tolerate, and this was the one dehydrated food I found that included a high amount of protein *and* added taurine, which cats need, so I decided to use it temporarily while I looked around more. The cats absolutely adored it. I've since found a cat-specific flavor from the same company, but I'll probably use a little of this now and then as variety (one of our cats gets bored with foods awfully quickly). The cats' coats look and feel shiny and healthy, and they definitely vomit less than when fed more mainstream foods. I also mixed it with some straight ground raw meat/organs/bone to make sure they were getting plenty of meat."
1.0,You are paying for the box!! and......$5.00 in candy.,"Small box of candy.  Not worth anywhere near $25.00.  You are buying the box.  I would suggest buying your own candy, most of it is still out there, and then make up your own novelty card.  Nice idea but not a good value at all."
1.0,HUGE PRICE INCREASE!  NO SALE HERE!,"Whow!  I was going to buy a couple of these boxes for my mother because she has SEVERE lactose intolerence and there are very few things that she can eat, until I saw that these wonderful bars have been raised almost $9.00 a box?????????  Whow, definitely NO SALE here!  Why is it that people are really starting to jump up prices on Amazon so high! Go to Liberty Orchard direct, they are less there. TOO BAD!  Very disappointed."
1.0,Dipped Fancy Berries,"The Strawberries were rotting under the chocolate coating. It was awful and had to be tossed in the trash immediately, ruining the precious momment that the item was ordered for."
5.0,Awesome choc. veg drink,"This is the only thing even remotely related to veggies my son will ingest. I've tried it and it tastes just like chocolate milk. The one weird thing about it is that sometimes there is a thin green color on top of the milk, but it mostly disappears when you stir it again. There're a ton of veggies in it. Excellent flavor. Highly recommended."
1.0,Not a good treat.,"I purchased these bones for my two large dogs.  I purchased the largest bones available, thinking this will keep my dogs busy for a while.  Man, was I wrong.  My dogs went through a large bone each within thirty minutes.  Now I have one very sick dog on my hands, which will probably end at the vets office."
1.0,Pack of four?,"I received the product as described, minus one of the boxes. As in I received three, not four, boxes of cereal.  Beware inept service."
5.0,My dog loves this,"These dog ""cookies"" smell good enough for people to eat, and my dog goes crazy for them...well, she's a beagle so there isn't much she won't eat, but either way, she gobbles them up!  I love that it's a healthy choice also.  We're not sure if she has food allergies, but when she started eating treats from this brand, she stopped itching and scratching as much as she used to."
5.0,YUMMIEST,"I bought the five LBS bag from a different retailer and they smell like sulfur and do not taste like mango a all.  These are great!  They are chewy and tast like mango.  They are slightly, but not over sweetened.  They ar just perfect; and the larger size bag is just te rigt size for family snacking without running out after one family snack time."
5.0,Great candy bar,I love these things.  Did not work great in milk shake.  I'm very impressed with all the Dagoba chocolate I've tried.
5.0,Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil,My favorite olive oil in metal can.  The pour spout only lets out a little at a time which is great. Also is easier to deal with then the one gallon cans.
1.0,really bad crabmeat for the price,Very poor quality for the price.  There was no flavor to the crabmeat; way over processed.  Was very surprised how easily the crabmeat lumps practically disintegrated into flakes when preparing crabcakes. Learned my lesson - pay a bit more at the grocery store for quality jumbo lump crab meat.
5.0,"BEST there is, turn plain chicken into a gourmet feast","A lady I knew belonged to an ethnic group that traveled around the world seeking artifacts from ancient civilizations and they would host dinners at each other's houses once a month; her stock dinner consisted of chicken wings cooked in nothing but this wonderful sauce, carrots sauteed in brown sugar, butter and ginger, green salad with Girard's original dressing, cold cooked broccoli served with sour cream and those French fried onions in a can and the dessert was vanilla ice cream with ginger biscuits soon to be available from Amazon.This sauce MAKES the chicken and all you have to do is bake chicken basted with this sauce, nothing else and you have created a fabulous and unique dish out of a very common food item."
5.0,Nom,"I absolutely love these. A friend had found them in a random store down in Oklahoma a long time ago, and I thought they were awesome. But as I don't live in Oklahoma, and can't find these anywhere in the MN area, Amazon having them is awesome. They're low carb and taste pretty great."
1.0,ggod product but too pricey!,"I like the drink but at $54.99 for 12 bottles it is way too expensive.  Wait until the price comes back to a more reasonable level, i.e., about $19.00"
5.0,"Good Quality, As Advertised","As a physician, I have been looking for quality sources of pure glucose powder for myself and for patients, as an alternative to table sugar and other fructose containing sweeteners. This product has been of a consistent quality, and tastes and mixes like pure glucose powder. One draw back is that it seems to be a bit more expensive per pound compared to the NOW product. Other than that it seems to be a perfectly acceptable source of glucose powder - mixes great into warm drinks and other recipes."
1.0,NOT really what I would consider Natural!,"Ingredients in order: Pure cane or beet sugar, cocoa, coconut oil, whey, maltodextrin, natural flavour, non-fat dry milk, salt, sodium casinate, mono and di-glycerides (emulsifier), guar gum (thickener), dipotassium phosphate (buffering agent), soy lecithin. I know there's disagreement over the natural label, but this was not what I was looking for. If I'd wanted all the processed stuff and chemicals, I'd have saved some money and bought Swiss Miss."
5.0,Gum!,Got exactly what I paid for!  Great deal for the amount of gum received.  The product was shipped extremely quickly.  If I ever need that amount of gum again I will be back!  Thank you!
1.0,This stuff is terrible!,"Maybe I got a bad batch? This stuff doesn't even remotely smell like soy OR vanilla. It's so unappealing that I can't even bring myself to mix some up and try it - and usually soy protein powder is a pretty standard product that tastes pretty good (to me, anyway). Thumbs down on this one - something's not quite right here!"
1.0,DO NOT DISSOLVE-CHOKING HAZARD,"Great in theory...healthy, organic, etc. ... however, this product does not dissolve in babies mouth NOR in Mommy's mouth.  My child, 7 months old, put one in his mouth, he has two teeth, tried to bite it, it did not break...he then sucked one for about 2 minutes then ... just like a kid...placed another in his mouth.  Reminding you, the reader, I was right there when this happened...he began to choke!  I lifted him out of his highchair, turned him around, did the Heimlich maneuver on him...he blew one out and then I pulled the first apple wagon out of his mouth.  On a lighter note, he's fine, prefers the puffs and whole grain cereal...but the dog couldn't even chew these!!!  We do, however, have friends, with a baby girl...same age...and she loves these!!!   Happy Baby Gluten-Free Organic Puffs, Sweet Potato Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6) "
5.0,Delicious and refreshing.,"I think that this tea is good bang for your buck.  I find that the flavors are more intense and the quality of the tea is better.  That written, I love this tea.  I like to brew it and serve it over ice in the summer with lemon for a garnish and maybe a  little honey.  Sometimes I do half tea, half lemonade over ice.  So good.  Orangey without being overpowering and subtly herbal."
5.0,"Homemade bread, at last!","We've been making bread from this mix for over a month now.  I like it, my family likes it, and it's really not complicated or difficult to make.  It is a little sweeter than what you've come to expect from a loaf of bread, but not in any way is that a problem.  I find that toasting the slices at about twice the heat of normal bread does make it possible to use this for sandwiches, and it makes an AMAZING grilled cheese.  French toast was fantastic as well.  We do bake the bread at a lower temperature for a longer time (325 for about 100 minutes) in order to try to get a good rise out of it.  Just know that the first couple of times you make the bread, it might not turn out great, but it doesn't take long to adapt the recipe to fit your needs."
1.0,Weird after taste,"I bought this from Costco for $10.  Being a chocoholic, I've always liked the chocolate hazelnut wafers.  After eating these, they had a disgusting mint like/bitter aftertaste even though they are not mint flavored. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or if this is simply their usual taste.  I will not buy these again.  I will be very surprised if people like this taste."
1.0,"item says ""Lucy's Chocoalte Chip""","i was shopping for SUGAR-FREE cookies, so they suggested other SUGAR-FREE cookies and i selected them, unfortunately, i'm a diabetic, and when i received the ""lucy"" chocolate chip cookies: NOT only were they assorted flavors (Which i DIDNT order) BUT they were NOT SUGAR-FREE!! why would they suggest these i have NO idea,but i'm very upset."
5.0,"Great pancakes and more, bravo Orgran.","This is a very good substitute for real pancakes. I'm celiac and have tried some truly abysmal rice pancake mixes, but this buckwheat is wonderful. I make it with a pinch of salt and use buttermilk, and it's even more like Bisquick taste. On my first attempt and just mixing by guess it made a very respectable crepe by thinning with milk and a little International Delight cinnamon hazelnut coffee creamer. It's near impossible to burn, much more forgiving than wheat to extra heat. I can't imagine what the pan review was tasting but it wasn't this mix."
1.0,cost 2x more than other sources,I love this product but I just got the exact same product for $10 at World Market.  This is a major over pricing for a very good product.  I would give the sauce 4 stars if it were not for the inflated price.  I wanted to buy another one to give to a friend for the solstice but dang they were sold out at the store.  Definitely try this but not at this price.
1.0,Hate this tea,This tea tastes terrible. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am a tea drinker and always love the natural flavor of the tea and the soothing feeling you get after you drink it. This tea tastes more or less like over the counter cold medicine.
5.0,Nice exotic spices,"These seasonings give our couscous a dark appearance, but it does not add a huge amount of flavor. It does taste good though. The pouch is small, but only a tablespoon of spice goes a long way."
1.0,taste like nothing,This what they call licorice has no taste at all its sticky slimy and its a shame that they call it Dutch licorice The only good tasting one they made is the beagle licorice.I will never buy there products again the quality is gone
1.0,micro powder salt,The micro salt was not really powder.  The salt was micro in size but did not have the ability to cling or stay on  a food substance when applied. After thinking about it I don't think it can be changed into real powder form. Other then being really high in cost will stop me from purchasing it again. However I was glad to see this product exist in this form anyway. Thank you.
5.0,Great Product!  Good Value!,"This is one of the best buys for the money.  I have tried other more expensive brands, but do not feel they are worth the cost.  I have used this coconut oil in cooking, for health, for hair treatments, and for body lotions and scrubs and have loved the results every time.  And I truly appreciate the convenience of having it shipped to my home in just a couple of days."
1.0,Metallic Taste,These olives tasted very metallic to me as well as guests for whom I had prepared a couscous salad.  I will not order them again.
5.0,"I'm a freak, I love Grape Nuts","Not much to say, it's a multi pack of Grape Nuts.  Crunches like gravel but fills you up.  I've loved the flavor since I've been a kid."
5.0,Just like old times,So pleased to see the real Mars bars again!  And they were so easy to buy through Amazon.  I'll be back for more!
1.0,La Dolce Vita Biscotti,"The service was fast and as promised. Unfortunately, the Biscotti was broken into very small pieces, with very few pieces intact.The product was padded at both ENDS of the box, but not the sides, and had obviously been mishandled. Sorry, but I would not risk buying this product by mail order again."
5.0,Well Worth Buying,"San Franciso Bay is an nice, inexpensive alternative to the K-cup.  I like a bold cup of coffee and this one comes through.For the money, this brand is well worth trying.  I paln to purchase again. It works well in my Keurig."
5.0,Absolutely love this,I love Cappuccino and this is a really good purchase every time I make it.  It tastes great and lasts a long time.  I like to add the caramel flavoring to it and makes a yummy warm drink for those cold mornings.
5.0,Far superior to the 'non Greenies' pill pockets.,"Like the other reviewer, I have also ordered Pill Pockets multiple times from multiple vendors over the last few years. I'm not sure about him, but I was always ordering the Pill Pockets that weren't from Greenies and they were almost always smashed and torn up. Occasionally I would get a good shipment, but it didn't seem consistent for any given vendor. Finally, I tried the Greenies brand and these all arrived in excellent shape. It could just be the vendor, but these Pill Pockets seem to be of much higher quality than the others. They seem firmer and much less oily. My dogs love them just as much, so I'll be sticking with Greenies in the future."
1.0,Bad substitution,"I have purchased the Cat Grass PLUS that comes in the container for years now and the cats LOVE it and leave my plants alone.  I am no longer able to find it at the retail store and when I do its over $5.  Thought I would try this version, cheaper and by the same company so what could go wrong?  I am now on the 4th package (Ibought 6 of them) and I barely get a dozen blades of grass...my cat is not interested and misses her lush Cat Grass PLUS...POOR SUBSTITUTIION on my part.."
1.0,not so good,"I bought this on accident meaning to buy k- cups. It is instant coffee and taste that way, Wolfgang Puck can't even make instant taste good."
5.0,Merrick California Roll cat food,"Yes, my cats loved this product and they run to eat it every time I give it to them. Must be a great combination !"
5.0,"Simply the Best Fiber cereal, period","I've tried just about every ""fiber"" cereal on the market, and this is the only one that is all natural and offers a ton of fiber.  All of the ""commercial"" brands of fiber cereal are loaded with artificial ingredients.  Read the label on this one, there are only a couple ingredients and they are easily identifiable.  The flavor of this product is excellent.  They also make it without the cinnamon, but the cinnamon definitely ""makes"" this product, and also may help control your blood sugar.  I usually eat this with another cereal mixed in, but it is quite edible on its own.  I just don't need 25 grams of fiber first thing in the morning.  You could also use this cereal as a fiber supplement and eat a small amount periodically through the day."
1.0,lots of air and little taste,I love seaweed crackers and was disappointed with these.  Lots of air and little taste.
1.0,quality is not always the same,"I bought this product about 6 months ago and was very much pleased with it. Therefore, I ordered it again last month. However, I am very much dissapointed this time. The beans seem overcooked and crushed. We did not get sick after eating it but I'm concerned that the company made a processing error. I won't buy this product again and do not recommend you to buy."
1.0,dissapointing!,"I agree with Shelley's review. Many of the gummy pieces were melted into an unrecognizable mess. About half of the box is unusable. Also, the taste is lacking... texture is very hard and difficult to chew."
5.0,Great nip,Just got it as a add on to an order and found that my cats really liked it. All you have to do is open the bag and they come a runnin.
5.0,Senseo Douwe Egberts at a Great Price,This is very good coffee and the price can't be beat.  Very fast delivery.
5.0,Better than McCann,"Upon receiving the product I conducted a taste test against the accepted standard -- McCann. I prepared tow batches of 1/3 cup oats, 4/3 cup water, one ounce granulated brown sugar. Served each portion with a pat of butter and 1/4 cup of milk.  I could tell no difference in texture or 'creaminess'. The CC, however, had a fuller, more natural taste to me.  CAUTION: six cannisters contain a LOT of oats. I live alone and this could probably sustain me through nuclear Armageddon, or at least through global economic collapse."
1.0,Broke On the 4th Day of Use :(,"Last night, I visited a friend who had bought this toy for my yellow Labrador.  My dog is a very fast eater when I feed her from her bowl, so I was delighted to try this.  I've used Buster Cubes in the past, and still really like them, but my Labrador has figured out how to remove the center piece that controls the difficulty so food spills out easily.  Buster Cubes aren't much of a challenge for her anymore.  When I put my dog's dinner into the Tug-A-Jug last night, for the first time, she looked at me as if I had played a cruel joke on her.  She saw the food in the toy, looked at me, cocked her head, and went to her food bowl.  I encouraged her to play with the toy, and she quickly figured out that she could get pieces of kibble by rolling the toy around, picking it up and dropping it, etc.  Right now, she is eating her breakfast, tail wagging, as she manipulates the Tug-A-Jug to get the kibble out.  It's only her second meal from the Tug-A-Jug, so we'll see how long this treat-dispensing toy lasts.  :)  ***UPDATE*** Today is the 4th day of use for this toy.  I have been feeding my dog 2x/day by placing her kibble inside.  This morning, my 13-year-old Labrador figured out how to remove the end cap and eat the kibble without working it out of the narrow end.  Tonight, she bit harder than usual and the end cap snapped, just above the threads.  It's not a treat-dispensing toy anymore.  I'm glad I didn't buy this car for myself, but I'm sorry my friend's gift was so short-lived."
1.0,A Big Disappointment,"I would have to agree wholeheartedly with the other one star reviews. This tiny little packet was way over priced and the vendor charged way too much for shipping. They charged $5.98 for shipping an item that they probably could have sent with a single first class postage stamp affixed.  I agree with those individuals who said these tablets taste funny and are definitely not sweet.  After dissolving the tablet, the quarter slice of lemon that I bit into was only slightly sweet... MY son said it tasted like lemonade. It did sort of taste like lemonade - more sour than sweet.  After that the effect pretty much was unnoticeable. I tried it again tonight with some raspberries and sour cherries. I tasted no difference, other than that of the strange lingering after-taste that the tablet leaves behind.  Another person mentioned having tasted tea after dissolving a tablet on the tongue. Like that person, I did notice a difference but did not really care for the taste. More like an artificial sweetener than like sugar. My son and I were very disappointed with this purchase."
1.0,Sugar is Fine - the packaging is horrible,"Whoever thought to ship 5 pounds of sugar crystals in a 2 piece cardboard box, held together by only a rubber band should be forced to travel to everyones home to sweep up the sugar crystals as they hit the floor when the outer shipping carton is opened.  I got about 2 useful pounds of sugar out of a 5 pound shipment.  The sugar however is excellent, but I would certainly never order this type of package again."
1.0,do not purchase,This item can be purchased in stores for much less!!!!! weight not listed...only 7oz.....i thought from price it was larger size or multi-pack
1.0,Transfats,"So disappointed when these arrived and they had transfats - also disappointed that these were mainly wheat flour, bleached flour, soy flour and artificial colours.  Sigh.  Here's the ingredients...  Enriched bleached wheat flour, sugar, dehydrated poi, leavening, dextrose, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, soy flour, nonfat dry milk, salt, eggs, buttermilk, red 40 and blue 1."
5.0,Love this stuff,"I had over the years sampled all of the Lindt bars through the 90% Excellence bar, but this one is something special. One has the sense he's savoring the chocolate equivalent of 24k gold. Exquisite flavor and texture combo. I did learn in my search for this elusive variant that it's available only online or in Lindt boutiques. Ordered four of them directly from Lindt at $5/bar."
1.0,Don't Buy Unless You Love Spam E-mail,"I ordered two types of coffee from Cafe Britt. Although the coffee was good, I have been hammered with their never-ending email spam campaign. I've ""unsubscribed"" from their emails three separate times with no avail. Buy your coffee somewhere else unless you love being spam-targeted for the rest of your life!"
1.0,Stale Candy,The candy received was stale and the light chocolate actually turned white.  It was non-edible
1.0,Thanks for your honesty!,"I've run across some old recipes that call for powdered vanilla.  I Googled powdered vanilla and came here 'cause this was the first entry.  Because people have been honest about the fact that this product is NOT powdered vanilla but some cheap-but-costly fake stuff, I'm not only NOT going to buy this, I'm NOT going to buy food items from Amazon.com.  Moving on in my search.  THANK YOU for taking the time to write and saving me from the same disappointment you must have felt."
5.0,Best dog food,Our boxer had horrible skin alleges and threw up all other foods starting about age 7.  Since changing she has no allergy medications and only has stomach issues when she eats food my kids drop!  I highly recommend this!
1.0,horrible,"I eat Quinoa often, so I know how it taste, this product actually taste like there is poison in it~ i wish I could get my money back. Do not buy, its horrible, and I am not one to write reviews, this is actually my first If i could subtract stars I would"
5.0,Great Product for Price,Okay let me start by saying that Dark Chocolate is my absolute favorite snack. Now this on top of pretzels makes me all warm and happy inside. I have to say for the price this is a quality product and they taste great. I'm on my fourth bag now and will continue to buy them.
1.0,terrible product,This was received in pieces and my daughter said the gingerbread tasted like dog biscuits. On the positive side Amazon fully refunded my money.
1.0,bad quality,These are very very small and taste really bad. The color of the cakes are really nasty. they look old and stale !!! They also arrived very late
5.0,Fantastic!,"I fell in love with this product.  I find artificial sweeteners sadly lacking in flavor or as stimulating to my taste buds as a flat soda.  This product has saved me.  I use it in everything I would use regular sugar for.  My favorite way to use it is to make lemon sorbet.  Talk about satisfying my sweet tooth and staying within my dietary guidelines, this is the one for me.  Now I want to find a ""brown sugar"" variation of this.  Raley's supermarket used to carry Smart Sugar and then quit stocking it.  I bought every last one on the shelf to tide me over until I could find another source.  Thanks to Amazon, I can now quit hoarding my supply and use it more freely.  I'll be placing my order for 5 bags very soon.  Thanks to everyone involved in the production of Smart Sugar!"
1.0,"A ""HINT"" OF YECK!!","I ordered several flavors of the ""Hint"" water and all of them taste very medicinal to me.  I was expecting a little more ""hint"" of flavor of whatever was on the label.  Not so...I had to add Crystal Lite to them just to make them palatable, which obviously defeats the purpose of buying flavored water in the first place.  The one big plus is that they are not carbonated, but otherwise...YECK!"
1.0,Mickey,I used this coffee years ago when it was sold by the A & P grocery stores but I did not like the taste of this particular coffee.
1.0,Try A Different Brand,"The Bergin Nut Company Dried Blueberries were not tasty at all. We consume a lot of dried blueberries for use as a snack, in yogurt and in our morning cereal, these were a huge disappointment. They were flat and stale tasting. Due to the fact that the bag was not cheap we tried to get through them anyway, still ended up tossing out part of it because just couldn't find good ways to 'disguise' the disappointing taste. To be honest, I have only ordered this make of dried blueberries once, so it could be that we got a bad bag. However, once was enough for me and we will not be ordering Bergin Nut Company Dried Blueberries again."
5.0,"Excellent, deep flavored mincemeat (make sure you buy the imported version)","Just make sure you find the imported version of Robertson's Classic Mincemeat (in the 411g jar as pictured above) and not the version made for the US market and distributed by GFI of Westport, CT (as sold in US supermarket chains).  The US version is: much sweeter (contains additional syrups), more of a soupy consistency, and has a lighter brown color.  The imported version is dark brown and has no corn syrup, ascorbic acid or salt.  The imported version had a ""Best Used By"" date, but the US version did not.  We bought both and after tasting, used only the UK/imported one.  See attached photos."
5.0,Healthy chips.,"Great taste but very low fat and sodium. Ideal for those who like chips but don't want the fat, salt and calories in regular chips."
5.0,Love at first bite.,"I use these in a treat ball for my Silky Terrier every night. To say that he loves them is an understatement.. He ""asks"" for the trest ball nightly."
5.0,Spicy and all-natural snack,I have never heard of this brand before but tried it since it seemed like something new and different.  What I liked: - Natural snack that has some sweetness and slight heat in spice but not overwhelming - The nuts are very high quality - US company  Really not too much not to like in this product other than it seems like 4 oz's can go very quickly.  Kids loved it as a snack.  This is probably a great item for this year's hiking trips.
1.0,Not worth the money,I had received a sample of the mandarin spice and it was so good. I ordered this and definately not the same. Tasteless. I will go back to the tea bags.
1.0,EkoJava ... not really ...,"As an avid Keurig user I looked at the EkoJava offering as an opportunity to be environmentally sensitive and perhaps save a little money. Well cost per cup just isnt there. Loading their plastic holder from the plastic packages they supply is just a pain ... funny thing, the plastic pouches arent recyclable. The whole thing is, frankly, a mess ... I suppose it reduces waste to some degree, but it should be to a great degree for the cost. At minimum go to paper or recyclable pouches. The price point seems to be designed to provide about a 10 cent advantage, which just isnt enough ... especially since you need to drink 120 cups to work off the cost of the reusable container before saving anything ... it might be *IF* it was trully Eco friendly. I'll not be buying any more of these, I can buy a canister of coffee and get the same effect with any of the reloadable cups available and not only be ecologically sensitive but actually save a bundle to boot. See separate review for the plastic EkoBrew"
5.0,A fantastic product for a Peanut Butter lover that needs to cut Calories,"I had seen this on Amazon and wanted to order it but was appalled at the shipping +cost of product, but put it in my wish list cart. Later I was at the store and found a different no calorie peanut butter and took it home and tried it and found that it was chemically tasteing and i threw it out. My husband bought me PB2 as a stocking stuffer (seeing that it was on my wish list) and I tried it that day and was AMAZED at how good it was at such a low calorie count. I mixed mine with water as per the directions and ate it with a spoon it was so good. I am fully intending to give up full-fat peanut butter for this as I need to watch my calorie intake. I am going to the Bell Plantations website to order a full case. It's THAT good. I plan on adding some to my morning protein smoothies and experimenting with stir-fry....but just off the spoon and on a PB & Jelly sandwich has been so good. My husband even says it's good...and he hates ALL diet food type stuff. Just try it once....you may love it."
1.0,Peanut Butter Eggs,Reese's peanut butter eggs were delivered with chocolate melted.  Amazon should not sell chocolate items unless they can guarantee they will be delivered unmelted!! I will never buy anything with chocolate again!
5.0,Some of the best jerky I've found on Amazon,"Quality stuff. Not fake or reprocessed like some of the jerky available here.  Nice well cooked chunks, with great flavor.  The price could be a little better... but you get what you pay for."
1.0,Product is not as good as it used to be,"No problem with the vendor or the shipping. My cat used to love this product & looked forward to getting it each night when I got home from work. I would  say ""beaver"" & he would come running & wait by his dish. This last batch is dry & my cat won't eat it. I even bought a can from a local pet food store & found the same problem. When I talked to the pet food store owner she said there have been a lot of complaints. I won't buy this product again & wonder what has changed  with the manufacturer. The local pet food store owner said this company is very difficult to deal with & it probably wasn't worth my time complaining because they are unresponsive. Maybe they'll care about quality when people stop buying their product."
5.0,Best dog food available,Our German Shepherd was a picky eater until we switched to Fromm dry dog food. Our Golden retriever had skin issues as well but cleared up once we switched to Fromm's. They are 100% USA sourced as well.  Highly recommend.
5.0,I love this green tea,"It's flavor is superior to all others I have tried. Sometimes I forget what I'm doing and leave the tea steeping for a long time. It is never bitter. I drink this tea everyday, all day. It is delightful hot or cold and requires no sweetener to make it palatable. I'm happy I stumbled across Triple Leaf at an Asian market, but even happier that I can order online. I have no problem buying 6 boxes at a time."
5.0,best pasta elbows!,"I use many different brands of pasta depending on the recipe but DeCecco is the only *elbow* pasta I use. These elbows are always part of my very best macaroni salad and macaroni and cheese recipes. Cooks up perfectly al dente on time, every time. Excellent flavor - with just a little salt in the water you could eat these plain right out of the strainer when they are done. Yummmmm! They have these tiny ridges on the surface which helps sauces to cling, enhancing the flavors of the recipe. Try this and see:  Macaroni Salad  8 ounces DeCecco Elbow Pasta 1 cups Hellmann's or Best Foods Mayonnaise 2 Tbsp. white or rice wine vinegar 1 Tbsp. coarse grained mustard (try  Inglehoffer Stone Ground Mustard, 4-Ounce (Pack of 12) ) 1 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper 1 cup thinly sliced celery 1/4 cup chopped sweet onion (*don't use red onion)  1. Cook macaroni according to package directions; drain and rinse with cold water until completely cool. 2. Combine vinegar, mustard, salt and pepper in large bowl. Stir in macaroni. Add mayonnaise, celery and onion. 3. Place in refrigerator to cool for 2-3 hours. Serve chilled.  Enjoy!"
5.0,A new alternative,I tried using this and never told my family that its meatless. They all enjoyed the patty and even ate more than 2. This is indeed great for meat lovers but are restricted to eat meat because of health issues. No difference at all... and even more delicious and yummy!
5.0,bigelow raspberry tea,"I can no longer purchase this tea in the stores, so this is the only place that I have found it.  Thanks, for carrying it."
1.0,"Without a doubt, the WORST mac-n-cheese I have ever tasted.","I bought the Annies Homegrown Microwaveable Mac-n-cheese.  Actually my wife bought it because it is so-called ""healthy"".  It was hands down the worst macncheese I have ever tasted, and after trying it, I would be loathe to try any more Annies products.  It had a nasty plastic-like aftertaste, I had to rinse my mouth out. I am throwing away the remaining 4 packets because I would not feed the crap to my cat!  This is a definite DON'T BUY IT!"
1.0,"Sorry, taste is not pleasing.","I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)"
1.0,Don't waste your money on this oil!,"This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made! It tastes like regular olive oil. I tasted it and then the Roland black truffle oil, and the Roland was far superior! Don't waste your money on this oil!!!!!!!"
5.0,Tastes Great!,"Bought this as a gift and was told it tastes really great! Too bad I don't have one of those machines, otherwise, I'd try them out myself.  I might have to consider getting one! If you really like it, you can save some money by subscribing to it for automatic deliveries and to make sure you don't run out."
1.0,Rasberry Raw revolution bar YUCK,"The bar looks good on the ingredients list, but it tastes bad. It has an oil film all around it. To eat these every day I could not do it, if it were a survival situation I could probably choke them down as the have no after taste thanks to the oil film."
5.0,Just Like Back in Thailand,"I first had these while I was living in Thailand for 6 months. These are just like the ones I would get from the stores in Asia. I used to eat these almost everyday!! I would have to say the creamy shrimp tom yum is spicier than the regular tom yum, but I absolutely love both. I happened to find them in the Walmart in St. Louis where I go to school but they do not have them at the Walmart in New Jersey, where I live. So I'm glad I found them on here for when I go home on school breaks. I can't wait to have them again, I'm craving them soo bad."
5.0,Good cocoa,I enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far.  My sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but I am glad I brought the variety pack anyway
1.0,Poor taste and ingredients,"Not a very tasty halvah, possibly because of the poor choice of ingredients.  Just what we need - hydrogenated oils and foaming agents.  Seriously, what happened to real food with real ingredients?"
5.0,Hubby Approved!,My husband LOVES the Slap-Ya-Mama seasonings!  He eats hot sauce and spices on everything and is very particular about what suits him!  I got him this last year for Christmas in a mall kiosk and had trouble finding it again this year when he wanted more... so happy to find it on Amazon!
5.0,The right blend of Ginger and Black tea,"Before buying this, I was dissuaded by the negative reviews on this.  Agree that this does not have a super strong ginger flavor which comes out and hits at you, but a subtle flavor which you can enjoy.  For a perfect blend, boil (yes boil, not dip) 2 tea bags in 250 ml of water or milk."
5.0,White Chocolate and Mixed Nuts - Delicious!,"I eat a protein bar daily, and look for ones that are high protein, low carb, and actually taste good.  This bar only had 10 grams of protein, which is half of what the Think Thin Proteins bars have, but this bar is delicious!  I love the nuts and having a sweet, crunchy treat. This is definitely one of my favorite bars.  It arrived during a heat wave (but the price during their June deal was so good, I risked it), and it does crumble easily from having melted and then cooled.  But other than that, this bar is a win!"
5.0,A Nice Conditioner,"Okay, so I'll be the first to admit that I'm not super picky about the kind of conditioner I use. I'd been using one by Joico, but was running low. So when I saw this in the vine program I ordered it. I like the scent, and it doesn't seem to dry out my hair or scalp, so all's good."
5.0,lovely oil,This oil was needed for a recipe and I came here and found this brand. It was wonderful and my guests loved it!
1.0,Make your own!,I bought this in white and black. It was $10 for both when I got them. Ran off the sides of the cookies and looked horrible. Then I made my own royal icing. Less than $10 with plenty of product to spare for a later date. 1 cup powdered sugar 1/4 tsp almond extract 2 tsp light corn syrup 2 tsp milk Mix sugar and milk. Then beat in the others. Add more corn syrup or a splash of milk if its too thick. More sugar if its too thin.  I put it in a ziplock bag and cut off a tip for piping. It dried hard. MUCH better than wasting money on the Wilton. Worked very well too :)  I can't think of anything I will be able to use my opened bottles of this for. I wish I could return them. The homemade icing is easy and works MUCH better. Use food coloring and get it different colors. I love the Wilton gel ones! So vibrant!
1.0,Pesky Rabbits/Squirrels/gophers,"Sprayed several days in a row but it did not keep my irrigation feeder lines from being chewed through.  I replaced the feeder lines four times and sprayed each time and the ""varmints"" would not stop.  I finally raised the main and feeder lines about three feet in the air with stakes and bars and so far it seems like they got the message and went away, hopefully.  At any rate, the spray did not do me any good.  Sorry."
5.0,Great Tea,"My wife had the Green Passion Tea at a Spa in Hawks Cay, FL Keys. She kept talking about it, so I ordered it. It is really good. We are now ordering the Raspberry and White Ambrosia tea."
1.0,Yuck!,"I almost threw up after one bite.  I might be preparing  them wrong, and I think angel hair or something thinner than the fettuccine might be more tolerable, but I'd rather have the few calories in egg noodles than these.  The odor after opening the bag really is disgusting.  It's just like rotten fish.  After a second try at boiling them (four minutes rather than one) and drying them a bit longer (though perhaps still not long enough) I managed to get rid of the smell mostly and they don't have a flavor.  The texture, on the other hand, is unbearable to me.  Rubbery?  More like slimy. They are so slimy and chewy, they must resemble raw squid.  I don't think it's like rubber bands, because I doubt chewing on a  rubber band would make me want to throw up. They are far too expensive for something hardly fit for human consumption.  SAVE MONEY, BUY EGG NOODLES!"
1.0,big POUT,"Did not taste the apple nor the shallots--- went to the trash. I was expecting a fruity flavor, with the hint of shallots... this was not a good flavor, tasted ""old"", was not good enough (I thought) to keep as a marinade."
1.0,Marshmallows," Dulces De La Rosa Marshmellows, 14.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)   I thought they were Kosher but they are made from PORK Gelletin. I was disappointed. And they are NOT made in the USA but in Mexico. Buyer beware!"
5.0,YUM,"I have had all three Belvita flavors and this is my favorite. I like the blueberry one but compared to the apple it isn't as sweet and the little blueberry pieces seem to stick to my teeth. The Honey Oat didn't have much flavor to me (these are just my personal tastes). The apple cinnamon is downright addictive! This flavor is always running out at my store so I tried ordering them online. They do break somewhat during shipping but not into crumbs, they stay in pieces. It's not a huge problem for me because I break a piece off to eat them anyway. Overall I'd prefer buying them at the store but this works when they're all out."
1.0,Broken Jars,"I've tried ordering this product twice now, and each time two of the three jars were broken.  They need to take better care when packaging this product."
5.0,Very nice chocolate pudding,"Where we live, I can't get chocolate milk in bigger containers so I make my own. I pop one of these in, add powdered whole milk or milk from cartons and process in my Blendtec blender.  I sometimes add a bit of cocoa powder too and voila, we have chocolate milk!"
1.0,NOT GLUTEN FREE!,"I purchased this product for a family member who has Celiac Disease.  The discription says ""Gluten Free"".  It is not!  It has Barley in it."
5.0,My dog loves them,Great product.  My dog loves the bones and they come in a ziplock bag inside the box.  Just like the ones at the store and much cheaper at Amazon.
5.0,"A definite ""yes!"" product","Superior flavor, not too green, not too black. Loved it from the first cup.I put a hint of Splenda/Sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days. Stumbled on it in  a shop but will be getting it thru Amazon in the future. I am here now because after tasting it I wanted to be sure I could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door. Again, a definite yes product! maggiemay"
5.0,Delicious Teas - Smooth taste,"I'm no tea expert - I just appreciate a nice tasting cup of tea. This sampler of different teas is a delight! I was surprised by the rich flavor of the organic peppermint, chamomile, and I just love the delicious organic chocolate rooibos mint tea. Organic white has a lovely smooth flavor I enjoy every day before I go to work. Well done tea - I was so impressed I ordered more of my favorites from their website :)"
1.0,Way Too Salty,"Imagine Organic Chicken Noodle Soup tastes good...but one portion, which is half a can and 100 calories has 29% of recommended daily sodium. Considering most people would eat a full can--just 200 calories--that's almost 60% of ones daily sodium! Beware...just becasue something is organic, does not mean it's healthy! Cannot recommend."
1.0,"Horrible, Bitter, All Salt & Chemical Taste","If I could give it zero stars I would!! I have never tasted anything so bitter in a seasoning salt before! There is something in this that is not right. It made me queasy after sprinkling a little on a boiled egg to test it. I don't know if there is some chemical they used to keep it from not clumping or what but that is what it tasted like, chemicals and salt. In fact saltier than salt. The rest of the ingredients were hidden. It was not worth buying at any price or getting for free, these went in the trash because I was worried there was something wrong with this that would make other people sick. I have bought other items from this line and they are fine but this...vomit worthy."
5.0,YUM,"PLANTERS PEANUT BUTTER -- CREAMY  Peanut butter rocks no matter how you enjoy it.  There is nothing in the world like a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich on soft bread, washed down with a tall cold glass of milk.  Another favorite is celery sticks loaded with peanut butter.  How about an apple cut into crisp slices and dipped into peanut butter?  Or homemade peanut butter cookies?  And the best ever -- a toasted English muffin, slathered in peanut butter and topped with honey?  The list goes on and on -  Planters Peanut Butter is simply the best I have ever had -- and I mean the best and creamiest peanut butter.  JIF is good, Peter Pan is good, Skippy is good, but Planters is THE BEST.  Undeniably the best peanut butter I have ever had.  The consistency of the peanut butter is so smooth and creamy.  Your bread will not tear while you are spreading it on thickly.  The taste is so full of peanut goodness and flavor.  The smell?  Divine!  The packaging is bright and eye-catching, with good old Mr. Peanut tipping his hat to you.  By the way, Mr. Peanut was created by a grade school boy, Antonio Gentile, in 1916.  He has been changed and updated over the years, but is still the same and easy to recognize peanut he has been for all these years.  Planters was established in the early 1900's by an Italian immigrant, Amedeo Obici, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.  The company and their products have been around all this time due to their excellent and quality products.  I had my 30 year old daughter blind taste test for me today.  I put a dab of Planters on a cracker, a dab of my former peanut butter on another cracker.  Hands down, Planters won.  She loved it.  She wanted to take my jar home, but no way, honey, no way.  Mommy isn't sharing this stuff!!!!  Wellll -- maybe I will share since VINE was kind enough to send six 16.3 ounce jars instead of the one promised. Wow, what a great surprise!  This peanut butter is excellent and should be in your pantry as a staple.  If you are a peanut butter lover - and who isn't? -- this is the stuff for you!  Thank you.  Pam"
1.0,cake batter flavor,"didn't like it and won't buy again, I had to use the whole bottle and still it didn't give the flavor like cake batter enough as compared to lets say Coldstone cake batter icecream.  So for me it wasn't very good."
5.0,Best Ever,If you give jerky a second try - this product is like nothing you've ever tried.  Totally moist - totally killer flavors - no nitrates.  My favorite was the Basil Citrus Turkey.  Need more!
5.0,Great Tea,Oolong is a good tasting tea and Sechung Oolong Tea is just about the best of the Oolong teas. The price is good and delivery was timely. I ordered 4 pounds and I'm glad that I bought this tea.
1.0,Nasty.  My dog wouldn't eat it.,"I have never written a one star review.  Ever.  Now, I've broken that hurdle with these bars.  I'd give them minus stars if I could.  They're that bad.  What putrid cesspool did these come from?  I've seen more appetizing grizzly bear poop that probably would've tasted better.  I picked these up from the post office and was hungry and thought I'd try them.  Strawberry, organic and all natural -- sounded really good.  I eat organic and all natural foods, so it's not like I'm  unfamiliar with the concept.  The box said they were vegan.  Okay, not all vegan stuff is great, but a lot is pretty tasty.  This stuff is horrid.  I can't begin to tell you what they taste like -- sickly sweet paste with sawdust and a bit of strawberry flavor might come close.  The word ""super food"" is a lie -- I hated the bar immediately, regardless of how good it was supposed to be for me.  I handed a piece to my husband who likes twigs and granola and he made a face.  One of my dogs took a sniff and walked away.  I convinced her to take a piece and she set it down and sort of ate it --  and then looked at me like I had played some cruel joke.  Now I'm stuck with 11 bars to foist off on people I hate.  I could've gotten a cool book read and instead I opted for this.  Don't buy these, they're nasty."
5.0,great candy,"Great flavors, Cant find these locally.  My favorite are blue and red, the flavors taste great, and there are enough to go around!"
1.0,Avoid this company,"I tried to cancel my order and they refused saying it had already shipped (this was over a week since I had ordered it), which was fine.  But, when I checked on shipment, it did not ship until the day it was suppose to arrive at my house.  I will NEVER use this company again."
1.0,Melted Energy Bar,"This product was REALLY BAD. When it arrived, after opening one of the energy bars, it looked like it had melted and also had some white fuzzy stuff all over it. YUCK! Because this was so bad, I hesitate to buy more food products from Amazon grocery. I've asked Amazon to resolve this."
1.0,Product NOT Gluten-Free,"The product description states that this tea is gluten free and that is incorrect.  The tea contains roasted barley malt, which those with Celiac Disease cannot have.  The label on the box even states that it may contain gluten.  Be cautious when reading product descriptions on this website."
1.0,HIGH SUGAR CONTENT...,"I ordered these because they advertise as LOW SUGAR...these are rolled in sugar and are high carb high sugar....bad!I threw them out, since they are opened, I did not thing returning them would get me a refund. Do not recommend."
5.0,My dog loves these!,"These paddywacks are actually dried pieces of buffalo neck meat.  Paddywack seems like a nicer name though, huh?  Regardless, they last longer than most chews, and my puppy loves them!  They have a slight smell, but they don't smell anywhere near as badly as bully sticks.  They also don't make her sick, like some other chews.  As soon as she sees me pull one of these out of the bag, she goes nuts.  They are great chews to keep her occupied, and are all-natural.  I highly recommend this brand!"
5.0,Great for Training!,"This is one of the few brands that have treats appropriately small enough for my Chiuaua-mix. But, having been the owner of a large dog, these would also be great for training large dogs.  Dogs don't really have a sense of size- they're as happy with a small bite as a much larger treat! And you don't want you're dog to be too busy chewing when you want to keep his/her attention and repeat a behavior.  These treats are just the right size!"
1.0,This is a rip off,"This product is the same price as a bag of 15 to 20 bully sticks and yours comes 4 in a package for this price.  It was my mistake to not see 4 in a package but I saw instead 12"" bully sticks with a photo of a large bag of bully sticks.  Very deceptive.  Why not put a photo of the 4 bully sticks one receives.  I will never buy them from you again."
1.0,Donde esta?,"I had never bought from this company before. I still havent gotten any of my extract to include my dark malt. Not to mention, because I have spent all this time waiting for a package to arrive, the brew I was planning on making is starting to go out of season. Un impressed"
5.0,Helps my leg cramps,This is the only product that helps my leg cramps.  I hope it will always be available.
1.0,"Too sweet, tasted like candy..gummy bears","I bought this thinking it was going to be a good healthy snack of raspberries. I was surely mistaken. The raspberries are coated with sugar, and other syrupy stuff and it tastes like you are eating gummy bears! GROSS!"
1.0,Bitter after taste,"I love bold coffee, but this is seriously over the top with a nasty, bitter after taste.  Maybe I just got a bad batch."
5.0,LOVE this stuff!!,I've been doing Weight Watchers and PB2 is great for helping me stay on track.  I can enjoy peanut butter for 1/4 of the points and it's so much easier to use in my smoothies since it is a powder.  The chocolate flavor is great to use with celery as well.  I will never use regular peanut butter again!
1.0,Disappointing,"I love spicy things, especially nuts. I was putting off buying these and finally did the other day. I was totally disappointed. The nuts had no flavor, it was if it was just covered in ground pepper, no salt or other spices.  Ate a handful or so and it made me sick.  Now I'm stuck with 4 more bags... not even worth gifting them. Bottom line, don't waste your money."
5.0,love it,"lots of coconut flavor and only a few grams of carbs.  make a lot more sense than paying $2.50 per bottle at the gym.  jen aniston is never wrong, right?"
5.0,"Great flavors, many uses, excellent price","I'm not huge on sugar free items sweetened with anything but Stevia, but I have to admit these syrups are really great tasting.. At the subscribe price, I got each of these really large bottles for about the same price I paid for a very small bottle at wally world, and they only carry a few sugar free flavors..  We're on Atkins, so we've really cut down on carbs, but we both like sweets, so these syrups let us still have sweets without the carbs..  The Hazlenut is not my favorite flavor, but I've used it in MiM's (muffin in a minute) and it tasted a lot better than I expected.. I know a lot of people use this flavor in coffee, but I don't personally like it in coffee. If you do, it'd be great for that.  The Classic Caramel is delicious.. I've used it in MiM's, Italian sodas, protein shakes and in coffee.. I've also mixed it with the chocolate sugar free syrup and the two together make another delicious taste treat.. The two combined make the best Italian soda ever! I've made chocolate MiM's with cream cheese frosting flavored with this flavor.. Love the taste.  I read some other feedback concerning the Classic Caramel, stating it isn't very good and to be sure to purchase the tradition Caramel.. I've never tasted the traditional, but have to say, I think the Classic is delicious.. Taste's like a piece of caramel candy to me.  The Chocolate is delicious. Works good in MiM's, italian soda's, coffee, cream cheese frostings, protein shakes, anything you want to add chocolate to without the carbs..  The Raspberry tastes exactly like raspberry's.. It's great.. We use it on home made yogurt with raspberry's on top.. pour a little syrup over it, and it's a delicious, low carb treat..Also great in a low carb protein shake mixed with raspberry's and a little syrup, mix in a blender and it's like a shake.. Delicious! I also used it in MiM's, or as cream cheese frosting on a chocolate MiM...YUMMY...Mixed it with chocolate in an italian soda.. Delicious..  The Irish Cream is delicious used in a MiM in both the muffin and mixed in softened cream cheese to frost it.. Also fantastic in Italian soda's.. Haven't tried it in a protein shake yet, but imagine it'll be great. Probably great in yogurt, too.. Very tasty!  I'm not a huge vanilla fan, but have to say, the vanilla is really good! Can be used in all kinds of things calling for vanilla, but really good when mixed with the chocolate in an italian soda or mixed in softened cream cheese to frost a chocolate MiM...  All in all, great variety of syrups.. The one I would change is the Hazlenut.. I've just never been a big Hazlenut fan, but I'm sure I'll find more uses for it eventually."
1.0,Never again,I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
5.0,great,We will keep these on hand 'always' - best mint candy around by far. (Wouldn't it be great if they were from the U.S.)
5.0,Love it,"I frequently use tea bags in my Keurig (tea brews very nicely without a holder or anything - simply place a tea bag or two where the k-cup would go, of course leaving the tag hanging out), but I can't resist ordering this k-cup regularly.  It's one of my top 3 herb teas, and is very refreshing.  Orange spice describes it perfectly.  Lovely hot or iced.  The k-cup makes a perfect brew.  Wonderful late at night because it's caffeine free."
5.0,Great pasta sauce!,"I have to say this is the best and most flavorful jar pasta sauce I've ever had...in fact, it's one of the best I've ever had, including fancy italian restaurants etc...nothing beats the intense flavor these tomato's have.  I highly recommend this pasta sauce!  I've only had the marinara, I like it to much I have yet to try the others."
5.0,fabulous flavor,"this coffee is now our favorite.  the flavor is deep, rich, velvety--no burned taste as with french roast.  the beans are rich and glossy.  intoxicating."
5.0,I am my father's hero!,"I rarely review products after purchasing things online - I guess I'm not a great contributor to the online community except in the case of being extremely impressed or extremely upset.  I was having dinner with my folks recently, and my dad was complaining that he could never find Spanish Peanuts at the local grocery store anymore.  He said he would find them at Wal-Mart on occasion (about one out of three times he went) - he also tried out a local supplier but was unhappy with the inconsistency of the quality of the nuts.  While he was explaining all this to me, I jumped on Amazon on my iPhone and searched for Spanish Peanuts, found a pack of 12 cans and bought them.  A few days later they showed up at our office and he was blown away!  He couldn't believe something that had been frustrating him for so long could be made so easy by the power of the internet (since then, I've got him connected on an iPad and am hoping I can get him to start surfing Amazon and other online retailers on his own!).  He was so grateful that he gave me two of the cans and I promptly went home and opened one up, made a bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge and spanish peanuts on top - talk about a trip down memory lane!  Reminded me of having dinner over at my grandmother's house when I was a kid and both my father and I have been smiling about this purchase ever since it was made.  Thanks Amazon!!"
1.0,soybean seeds,"very dissapointed in the seeds.  The quantity was as advertised (about 25 per packet), but the germination was very poor.  I ordered 2 packets (planted about 50 seeds) and only 9 plants germinated.  I am blaming the seed only because all the other seeds that I planted such as sweet corn, green beans, peas came up without any issues."
5.0,Crunchy and delicious,"Wow, I would never have guessed this is gluten free!  It is really quite delicious, not overly sweet, and is nice and crunchy.  It does contain flakes, but not too many which is a bonus for me because I am not keen on cereals that consist predominantly of flakes.  The taste and texture is a great combination and that it is gluten free is just a bonus."
5.0,As Good as Everybody Says,"I just got this stuff, but after one batch I'm hooked. It's easy, it's tasty, it works. I admit I doubled the butter but I can't say it was necessary."
5.0,"Delicious, healthful, and well-priced!","I love stretch island fruit bars! Our local Costco started carrying these a few years ago, for about the same price found on amazon. I quickly became attached to these delicious and healthful treats, and was very disappointed when Costco stopped carrying them. Amazon to the rescue, of course!  Great for kids, no added sugars or bizarre ingredients, and try a few of these in lieu of an ""energy bar"" before strenuous exercise, along with a small handful of nuts... Plenty of energy whatever the activity!"
1.0,stale chocolates,"When I received my shipment of Milka chocolates from Euro Food Mart, they were already stale! I opened the first chocolate bar and more than half of it was discolored and obviously stale. I find it suspicious that the expiration date was coming up in six months yet the chocolate was already stale, and when i wrote to the customer service department of this company they told me I had to pay return shipping to send back the unopened chocolates for them to refund me. This is not the right way to do business and I am never buying anything from this company again. They should pay for the return shipping since I already paid a $10 shipping fee for this company to send me stale chocolates."
1.0,I have only tried the BBQ flavor but...,"...they are not so good in my opinion. Described on the bag as light and crisp, they are anything but. These are thick chips made double thick by all the flavorings which is just so over-done, it is falling off into the bottom of the bag. You get about 6 actual chips with loads of orange flavor dust in the bottom of the bag, and it's not the kind that you can dump into your mouth at the end, it is sooooo salty. I bought these for vending (1 oz size) because the Kettle Brand BBQ (which IS good btw) has never come back in stock since I purchased them this past summer. The price is not bad on the madhouse chips but now I have way too many that I will not be able to sell very well (72 pack). I'll probably end up giving them away."
1.0,Too Expensive!,"You can buy this exact product at Costco for $13.  The last time I was there 2 weeks ago, it was $12.79!"
1.0,fake jerky,Awful taste it was soft and airy I fed it to my dogs.
5.0,Arrived in one box with a 12-pack and a 24-pack inside,"My items arrived intact, with no breaks or leaks.  The packaging of my 36 individually wrapped chocolate liquors didn't look like the photo on the item's detail page, but the contents were what I ordered."
1.0,"Honestly, gross","I love cookies and chocolate, but these are gross. They taste to me like chemicals and sugar, and the fudge gooey-ness just means more chemical in my mouth. Ugh."
1.0,Changed flavor,"I was so excited to find these again after all these years and I had ordered them a few months ago.  When I received this package, it was different and had a very distinctive smell.  I tasted some of one and had to throw the whole box away.  Careful when purchasing..."
1.0,Brown water,"Over the years I have started drinking more tea and have found that there is a HUGE difference in taste from manufacturer to manufacturer.  I have found that Lipton has almost no flavor (it used to, some years ago).  I currently have about 20 different teas on hand, most from English or Asian manufacturers, which have a noticeable flavor.  If you love tea, try one of the imports.  You'll be surprised how bland Lipton really tastes."
5.0,necta sweet,I purchased this product for my mom as you can't seem to find it in any grocery or healthfood stores anymore.  The shipping was FAST and I was able to have them send it directly to mom- something Ebay doesn't offer.
5.0,perfect little tea lovers gift,This tea is so delicious and the package of 10 is perfect for a little gift for someone.
5.0,Wheels of deliciousness!,"Our 5 year old and 2 year old LOVE these. I've made pasta salad with them, grown ups are amused and readily try it!  The case is by far the best value for purchasing these!  Store great and have a tape closure on bag."
5.0,Texas Toothpicks dog treats,"The product was as described.  There are quite a few of these in the bag.  I have a small yorkie, so I cut them even smaller for her because some of them are quite large, but she just loves these as a treat!  The product arrived very quickly following the order being placed.  I would order these again!!!"
5.0,Fresh Cup-A-Java,I love how I can make a fresh cup every morning without wasting a drop!  The French Roast for OneCup for Keurig K Brewers was tasty! I look forward to trying some of the other flavors.
5.0,Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite,Our family is a huge fan of IZZE and this was right in line with that. The flavor was not too sweet and refreshing. My favorite way to enjoy this was with some ice and vodka...obviously that's only for those of you reading this that are 21 yrs or older!
1.0,Tastes like cardboard,"I'm a huge fan of the Original Osem pearled couscous. Its easy and fast to make, tastes great, and is quite versatile for any meal. Therefore, when I found out that there was a whole wheat version, I was thrilled and ordered a set as soon as they were available on Amazon.  I have been completely disappointed. Unlike the Original version, this couscous is not the small little balls, but rather small cylindrical chips. This different shape and texture prevents the couscous from absorbing any of the seasonings I add while it's setting, something the Original ones did easily. Even worse, the couscous tastes like cardboard. I've eaten couscous plain many times before and it has never tasted like cardboard. This couscous tasted like I was eating the box it came in. I wish I were exaggerating, but I'm not. Now I have to figure out what I'm going to do with 11 boxes of inedible cardboard...  Bottom line: I would NOT recommend this product. Get the original version instead."
5.0,Excellent wild caught sardines.,"These are the smaller, brisling sardines--several per can. The taste is quite good, not overly fishy. Despite having ""No Salt Added,"" I can't imagine wanting sardines any saltier than these. Being salt-water fish, they do contain some salt (125 mg per can, or 5% of the recommended daily intake). Two ingredients are listed: brisling sardines and soy bean oil. If you enjoy sardines and want to reduce your salt intake, these are for you. Also, I disagree with a previous review claiming these are ""dry."" I highly recommend these."
1.0,Tastes Like Diner Coffee,"This is not a dark roast. The packaging may be pretty but the coffee is terrible. I brewed it several times now (adding more coffee) and it always comes out weak, flat, and watered down. This is worse than Folgers."
5.0,"Delicious, Healthy and Natural","This drink is one of its kind, to blend coconut water and coffee is pure genius. The drink is a true experience yes there are a lot of ready to drink cold coffee drinks but only one with coconut water and all natural organic. Coco Cafe hits an inside the park home run with this drink its just awesome better than a home run IMO. If you haven't tired this yet get on it! This is a beverage you will enjoy, crave and share with friends its just that good."
1.0,Tastes like...nothing,"I purchased this tea at a retail store. I was terribly, terribly disappointed. It didn't taste bad...it tasted like nothing at all. I wasn't expecting a strong taste but the tea bags don't even smell like anything. Literally...nothing. They are the nice fabric-bag type tea bags. This was my first experience with this brand...maybe their other flavors are better."
5.0,Inexpensive But Still Healthful,"I have 4 cats, so I can't afford to splurge on their food.  And sometimes they don't all like one product, and that doesn't work for me.  This kibble is liked by all 4 cats and seems more healthful than some of the less expensive brands.  Good luck pleasing your cats!"
1.0,made in China and allegedly killing dogs... literally,"A lawsuit filed in federal court following multiple dogs dying after eating Waggin' Train ""Yam Good"" dog treats and also Waggin' Train jerky tenders--produced and supplied by JOC Great Wall Corp. Ltd. of Nanjing, China for Nestle Purina Pet Care Co. If you love your dog, would avoid this product and others made in China."
1.0,Too Salty for Me!,"I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.  So I'm giving the entire box away tomorrow to get them out of here.  What a bummer!  That's the problem when you try something new with Amazon in the food category, you have to buy a boatload,,,and if it doesn't work out, you've wasted $20.00.  I don't  see what the point is in air popping something so it's low in fat but then making it way too salty,,,,sure defeats the purpose in my viewpoint.  Not good,,,,I'm really not pleased."
5.0,Pamela's wheat free and gluten free bread mix,"Out of all the ones I have tried, this is the best tasting and the easiest to make and also bakes as the package directions say that it will.  Great item,"
1.0,changed recipe no longer good,"they pulled the old bait and switch, nothing to see here now folks. once a five star sauce lineup has become a 1 star mess. my advice? fire whatever new chefs you hired, because i prefer the cheaper pasty sauces over this chunky seed mess. apparently they must've forgotten what cheesecloth is, i shouldnt have to strain their sauces myself just to get an average flavor that totally is not worth 9 bucks anymore."
5.0,6 Great Flavors,"I like every one of these syrups and the price is right. I really didn't want the raspberry but its very good. Served flavored cappuccinos to my Bible study group and they loved them too, especially the Irish Cream. My favorite is Hazelnut followed by Vanilla. Hard to find Torani where I live so, so I'm happy I can reorder on Amazon. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste as long as you don't overdo it on the quantity you use per beverage. It's great in yogurt too!"
1.0,very watery with no real flavor,This is just awful! The color looks like soured milk and the taste is very watery. I will not buy this again!
1.0,4 days late and still hasn't arrived.,"Not sure if the product is good yet, but it promised to arrive ""next day"" and here I wait,  4 days later.  Since it is a food product, I'm not excited to receive 5 day old noodles...of course that assumes they arrive tomorrow."
5.0,Worked Better than I Thought,"We have a terrible problem with fruit/drain flies and are always looking for ways to combat them.  Usual fly paper works well but it's so sticky and unattractive.  So I tried this stuff.  At first I didn't think it would work, but it does.  It's big but easier to hang and work with than our usual paper.  Don't know if it works with larger flies, but it sure attracts the small ones."
5.0,Great product!,"Since I do not drink a lot of milk, this is the best way to keep it on hand for cooking.  This particular product has excellent taste.  It is also very economical to keep on hand instead of having to toss out soured milk in liquid form that I didn't need.  It also comes in a easy-to-use package."
1.0,Way Too Much Salt,"Just after one bite, I could really tell there was way too much salt in the jerky.  After two bites, I simply couldn't eat more. Nutrition Fact says one serving's Sodium Content is 1540mg - 64% of daily value. I would not recommend this jerky unless you already know what it taste like."
1.0,Not like the picture!,"I ordered these because my dogs like crunchy banana chips. The picture makes these look crunchy and light yellow. What I received was dark brown, squishy banana chips. The expiration was fine. I just want everyone to know that they are not the yellow, crunchy ones."
5.0,"The Best, Most Authentic Coconut Water - Amazing seller!","I just got back from Thailand, and  I think I drank at least one coconut per day.  Upon my return I wanted to find something that compared to the original (it's hard to keep coconuts in the fridge!)  I thought Zico was ok, but it tasted watered down and nothing like the Thai Coconuts I was used to.  I tried Amy and Brian's on a whim at whole foods and fell in love.  It's naturally sweet, so flavorful, and I love the pulp's texture.  I was hooked.  Finding it here at an amazing price was the kicker.  I saved SO much money, which is good because I didn't think I could afford my new addiction.  Thanks for the fast, free shipping!!"
5.0,"Great stuff, but a bit too much licorice","great product, but the hint of licorice isnt very ""traditional"" with pumpkin and may turn off a few traditionalists. But I thouroughly enjoyed this tea."
1.0,Picky Cat Owner = Beware,"There is nothing inherently wrong with this food, other then the fact that my cat will not eat it.  He begs and begs, with a full bowl of this alleged food in front of him.  It looks a lot healthier then the organic stuff before.  Some sites have suggested that cats can become carb addicts just as humans do.  Even tried a slow transition.  At one point i even left the bag out, open, on its side, seeing if i could trick him into thinking ""JACKPOT"".  He would pull a few out, and then pull a few more out... And not eat any of it...  Would not recommend"
1.0,"Scary, mine was in a repackaged container!","I'm half way though the first can I have ever bought and I happened to take the outside wrapper off.  To my dismay, I found that there had been another wrapper on the container.  The original wrapper was a a purple/blue color, now I have no idea what I have given my daughter, was a it was I thought I bought or some unknown formula repackaged.  I'm livid.  This is scary as hell.  Do not trust this formula."
1.0,maggots!,"I'm not repulsed by pests in my food (I figure if it's cooked, it can't hurt you), but i was disspointed to find 5 dried maggots in this product given it is produced in the US, I paid $5 for it, and i was hungry and really craving mushroom risotto.  I found the maggots when i rehydrated the mushrooms and strained the liquid through a paper towel to remove grit."
5.0,I love this! BUT (EDITED),"I love this assorted chocolate. Sadly it is not available in the States. It is nice to find it here, but I think six packs is just too much. I wish they had one packs! I especially love the strawberry/orange ""paste"" chocolate covered ones.  EDITED: I wish I can go and edit the seller feedback but so far it seems that this is not possible. I really love these chocolates and I think that the problem is not from the manufacturer but from the seller. The box arrived very perfumey -strangely- and that affected the quality of the chocolate because the chocolates also started to taste like perfume. :( If you could find a different seller then that would be great :)"
5.0,I love it!,"I purchased this salt a month ago, and Im super satisfied with it! It tastes delicious, smells like the sea, and the most important thing is that it has so many beneficial minerals that make it very healthy for the body.  Its the best!!!"
1.0,Fake tasting and not pleasant at all,"I love Taco Bell, and have been known to hoard packets of hot sauce from the drive-thru so I can add them to all sorts of food (e.g., scrambled eggs, homemade quesadilla, etc.) When the opportunity to try this Ranchero sauce came up, I was so happy! Until I tried it... and, wow, this is really NOT a taste I enjoyed.  Ranchero sauces are supposed to be a combination of tomato, green chile peppers, onions and other spices like cumin. This one has NO tomato flavor and, rather than a green chile taste it's more of a chile powder flavor... but a very STALE chile powder. Oh, it has zing, but even that doesn't taste right; it's not chile pepper or jalapeno-tasting. It just tastes fake and somehow muddled, like there are just too many things competing, and none of them are any good.  Sorry, Taco Bell. I still love you, but I can't stand this sauce!"
5.0,Excellent Tahini,"Excellent product for hummus or any other recipe that calls for tahini. Since it is natural with no junk added, the solids separate from the sesame oil. I just shake the container each time really hard before using it and when it becomes very hard on the bottom, I cut it with a knife and just use a bit of water or lemon juice to thin it. Al wadi again delivers a great product."
1.0,"Abysmal, Horid, and Wretched","Absolutely the worst Kenya coffee I have ever had.  On top of it all, Amazon does not have a satisfaction guarantee on the grocery items.  So the moral of the story, don't buy this coffee and read Amazon's fine print."
1.0,Not So Pumpkin Pie Flavor,"First off I want to thank the vendor for his quick response to the order I placed.  I would order from this vendor again.  The problem I have is with the product itself.  It has a terrible taste, nothing like pumpkin pie or even a pumpkin spice flavor.  It's flavor was too high in sugar alachol tasting.  THIS IS THE MANUFACTURERS PROBLEM.  I HAVE PURCHASED OTHER FLAVORS FROM THIS MANUFACTURER AND THEY WERE GREAT...THIS ONE GETS A THUMBS DOWN."
5.0,Yummy!,"Great gift, delicious treats, individually wrapped, ready to enjoy!  Nice hostess gifts as well as convenient to pull out for drop in guests.  We try to keep a canister available at all times.  Very nice candy which appeals to nearly everyone."
1.0,bad to the bone,take a cup of salt water add smoke and drink it that how bad it was in my opinion yepper full of salt
1.0,Avoid this product!!!  Minus 5 stars!,"So far, 2 of the 12 boxes of wild rice have had worms in them!  You do not want this product, or anything else from this company."
5.0,more cheese sauce please!,"I ordered this by mistake, was looking at it online and decided i didn't need it & didn't intend to buy it.  Well i must have forgotten to delete it from my cart and when i placed my order i guess i didn't notice it there. I'm usually very careful about these things so i must have been running a fever that day.  So any-hoo i was a little bit surprised when it showed up on my doorstep one day.  I don't really cook much so i thought what the heck am i gonna do with all this powdered cheese???  So far i have added it to a steamfresh package of cauliflower with cheese sauce that i was disappointed to find had virtually no cheese flavor at all. Thankfully this stuff cheesed it up up up and saved the day (i was quite happy to have my random powdered cheese package laying around that day.)  Another time i was having major cheese cravings, I added it to an Annie's microwave mac n cheese packet and i was in heaven.  Oh and i also slapped some on top of microwave popcorn, which was quite tasty as well.  SOOOO.....I'm glad i bought this stuff by mistake.  I don't know much about cheese powders in general, but i can say that this particular cheese sauce powder has a great cheesy flavor and nice consistency when you mix it up.  I will order more when it runs out. :)"
1.0,Didn't really like it....,I was so excited to receive this. Thought I would cut down on the calories. I didn't like the taste at all. We baked a banana bread and we threw it out. I am going to try again with brownies and add a little bit more. Maybe I just did not add enough. I thought it had an after taste though. I will still use it up and try once more.
1.0,Don't waste your money!,"It doesn't smell like coffee, it doesn't smell like vanilla , it doesn't smell like cookies.  The smell is disgusting.  I could be more desciptive but I realize I am with polite company. And on top of that , it does not do anything for my bags under my eyes.  Don't waste your money!"
1.0,This Poison Should Get 0 Stars,"By the title, you should get the hint of what this product is all about. First af all, I have fed this Duck and Potato dry food to my dog for 4 years and never had a single issue, in fact she was a heathly vibrant dog with great vitality during that period. I bought 4 large bags about 5 months ago, because I like to keep a nice supply on hand. After I fed her from a freshly opened bag, I was greeted with a bloody diarrhea crime scene all over the house at 3:00 in the morning. Actually, it was more blood than stool and I freaked out not knowing what was going on, she was then shaking uncontrollably in discomfort. I took her to the vet and $200 later after all the tests, we found nothing. I put her on a strict chicken and rice formula for a month and she was just fine, so I decided to start feeding her the same Natural Balance again, not knowing it was the food doing it and the same nightmare happened again(bloody mucusy stool). Another month of Chicken and rice and no problems. Well, tonight I mixed in literally 15 small pieces of that Duck and Potato with a bunch of rice and chicken and I can already hear her stomach gurgling like it did before. I promply gave her an anti-diarrheal just to be safe, but i'm watching her close and it'll probably be another sleepless night of cleaning up a disaster zone.  I just finished reading other reviews tonight on the net about other people having similar problems and it's all because this company changed their formula. I think the ""new"" formula is worse than that tainted malamine food that got in the supply a few years ago. My pet store won't return the bags I have, because I never thought about keeping the receipts from a product I've used for soo many years without problems, now I have to eat another $200 and toss this junk on the garbage. I won't even consider giving it to my neighbors dog, because I'm not the sadistic type.  This product should be recalled and it's not healthy for any dog. Even if it seems the dog might not be showing bad symptoms, it can't possibly be good considering what my dog has gone through. Shame on you Mr Patten for cutting corners and you better come out with a formal apology for this mishap. I am using several types of your canned food at the moment(except the duck and potato canned food) and the are no problems this those(yet), but rest assured I've lost faith with the reputation of your company and will move on to other healthier avenues for my dogs dietary needs."
5.0,Great Coffee Beans,I have to admit I was a bit reluctant to buy espresso beans over the internet/Amazon.  But based on the reviews on the Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Beans I thought I would give them a try.  Really glad I did.  I will certainly buy more when I need to restock.
5.0,Long lasting,"I have two vigorous chewers. I've tried so many chews and toys but hardly anything lasts. Nylabones do though. They prefer edible chews, but these last longer and won't make them fat!"
1.0,"Actually and sadly, there's no such thing as real truffle oil.","I too was fooled, but apparently there is no such thing as truffle oil made with truffles.  They are all made with a chemical compound.  See this article from the New York Times:  Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles By DANIEL PATTERSON Published: May 16, 2007 http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/16truf.html?_r=1&ref=dining&oref=slogin  As the article notes, it's not possible to infuse oil with a truffles and ALL oils claiming to be made from truffles aren't. Don't feel too bad, even rather famous chefs fell for the idea.  But all of this explains the ""one-dimensional flavor"" of these oils.  One might argue if it tastes good then it doesn't matter.  Perhaps, but that doesn't explain why the oils costs so much."
5.0,Can't be easier!,Timothy's coffees get me out and ready to go each morning. I also love this product for at night when I am up late grading. The convenience is one thing....the taste is another! Rich and smooth! Feels like I am getting the real thing-caffeine-without the side-effects.
5.0,Glad I found a way to get it!,I moved out here to California a few years back and one of the things I found that was not available out here was Dale's Seasoning. It has been a staple at my house in Tennessee for years! I used to bring it back to CA by the case every time I went home to visit. Now I can get it between visits! Great product and I found it at a great price!
5.0,Yummy,Fun little cans of jerky. Tasty jerky and buffalo bills sent me free samples with my order! Amazing!!
1.0,Didn't meet my expectation,"I ordered these cookies following my exposure to similar cookies (from Canada). When I received these ones, they were soft, gooey and stale. Even my kids rejected them."
5.0,flowering tea,I purchased this item as a gift for a tea lover who had never tried these flowers before.  She loved the variety of different flavors and said they were all very flavorful...only finding one she did not care for. The flowers opened beautifully too in the glass teapot included in the set.  The package arrived intact with no damage.
5.0,Great Stuff!,I have been using this for a while now.I use it every day and like the idea that I can add fiber to any recipe calling for sugar.  Works great for my low carb diet.
5.0,Gluten Free Mama is the best!,"I have tried all different kinds of gluten free products and Gluten Free Mama is by far the best I have ever had.  The texture is the closest to normal of any gluten free product that my family has had.  My husband can't stand gluten free baked goods and even he enjoys everything that I make from Gluten Free Mama!  Most gluten free baked goods are very grainy but I haven't had that complaint with Gluten Free Mama products.  The pancake mix is probably one of the best pancake mixes I have ever had gluten free or not!  The Almond Flour is great, makes great muffins, and the Coconut Flour is also amazing.  All of the products have great flavor and texture, and if you have ever tried eating gluten free you know how important texture is.  You can also make really good biscuits from the pancake mix as well!"
5.0,Scrump-deli-icious!,"Pros: This is a terrific chocolate-y breakfast cereal.  And only slightly higher in calories than the original flavor.  Lower in calories than similar chocolate-y cereals.  Cons: The factory stopped making it for ""awhile.""  I contacted them and they assured me that they still market the product.  But it's hard to find.  Even when I tried to order it from the factory it is on back-order."
1.0,"Beware...this is not Pancake Syrup, despite the label!","My sister is diabetic and loves pancakes.  Most sugar-free pancake syrups are made with sorbital, which can cause extreme digestive system problems.  I found this product and thought we'd finally found something she could use, as it was made with splenda.  Watch out folks...this is not pancake syrup, despite what it says on the label.  It is a liquid flavoring that is added to coffee drinks.  It is watery, slightly sweet, and doesn't taste like maple syrup.  We were able to get a refund, but it was because the bottles we got were out of date, not because of the false advertising.  The seller, Beverage Gourmet, was absolutely disappointing in their handling of our problem. (The manufacturer, to our surprise, was very helpful but ultimately we had to deal with Beverage Gourmet)."
5.0,gotta love those raisin nuts,we have become addicted to this cereal and fight over the nut covered raisins .. so it makes sense to buy it in bulk so everyone has their own box.
1.0,Expensive,"The shipping weight of this item was listed as 4.8 ounces, and I misread this as the weight of the bars.  The actual weight of the bars, as received, is one ounce each.  This is very expensive, $61.92 a pound, for cocoa butter."
5.0,Outstanding.,"Honestly, these candies could possibly be too good. My patients seem to grab a few extra on their way out the door. And I'm guilty of have a few there and there as well. So, needless to say, my candy dish is always having to be refilled.  These candies are very mild but very tasty. I know you'll enjoy them."
5.0,JERKY,RECEIVED THIS ITEM ON TIME AND IN EXCELLANT CONDITION. THIS IS THE ONLY JERKY THAT I LIKE BECAUSE OF THE TASTE.
1.0,should ship without damaging what I pay for.,"I buy a lot of stuff, and a LOT of vitamins, herbs, homeopathic remedies, and only organic food.  I bought some over priced oil from these people, and it came in a simple envelope with the lid cracked off (the foil kept it from leaking in the mail.  I called and asked them to mail me a cap for the plastic bottle, so I may dispense & use the oil.  No cap came.  With other companies available online, and an opportunity to make a comment, I waited over a month to post a comment.  These people need to  a) ship in a way to protect your purchase  b) replace what they send and is recived broken.  Won't be back.  (you know, first time, shame on you.  second time, shame on me...)  J.T."
1.0,Picture doesn't match product,Picture is of a 10 oz box. Product is a bunch of small plastic bags. The teddy grahams in the smaller plastic bags are not the same as the ones in the box.
1.0,Seriously?,"This may look like a less expensive alternative to Roundup Extended Control, but here's the real deal:  Roundup Extended Control:  One bottle of concentrate (1 qt) makes 5 gallons and covers 1,500 square feet.  It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 4 months.  In my experience, this is more like 4-6 months, even on gravel covered ground during the AZ monsoon season.  Cost at the time of this writing = about $35 (but I've found it for less at a popular big box Home Outlet).  Ortho Ground Clear:  One bottle of the ""concentrate"" (1 qt) makes 1 gallon and covers only 75 square feet. It's advertised to prevent new growth for up to 1 year, but when you open up the label on the bottle you'll find this figure revised to 6-8 months for areas of ""heavy rainfall.""  Cost at the time of this writing = about $10.  If you want it to cover the same 1,500 square feet as $35 worth of Roundup Extended Control, you'll need to spend $200 on 20 bottles of Ortho Ground Clear.  I think I'll stick with the Roundup.  By the way, the instructions on the bottle of Ground Clear tell you to mix 1 quart into 1 gallon, but the bottle is only labeled in oz and mL.  Somebody in the label making department wasn't paying attention."
5.0,This Is Good Stuff!,"Of couse, you have to like creaminess.  If you do, give this creamed rice a try.  Yeah, I know it's not cheap; so use it for a special occasion.  However, don't think you're going to eat maybe half a can and save the rest for tomorrow.  You won't stop until that doggone can is empty.  It's sweet; but a pleasant, soothing sweet.  Very old-fashioned and came in real handy one day when I was feeling just a bit yucky.  You know, you feel like you need to coat your stomach with something rich, but not upsetting. Like maybe a baby food with grownup flavor?  Yeah, open a can.  Make sure it's in the refrigerator waiting or you."
1.0,Bags break at seams,"Just like 'share' reviewed, I have ordered these for a year, and had no problem.  Then the seams split in the bags.  I now bring a store bag to put these bags in, in case they break.  I will not buy these again."
1.0,Tastes like dog food,"Take a big whiff of a dog food bag and smell that gross stench of nasty dog food...keep that in mind because when you chew into this bar you get 2-3 chews of banana and then all of a sudden this WAVE of dog food overcomes and I gagged and had to spit it out...that was so disgusting. Me and my husband love healthy foods, and I'm all about organic and healthy foods...but this....this wasn't food...this was something that should be given as dog treats to your pups. EW."
1.0,My cats were un responsive,"I've had cats my whole life and Catnip is a mysterious thing that I sure don't understand.  They say not all cats are affected (which could be a made up lie someone in the catnip industry created) so you never know if its the cat or the catnip brand or maybe the cat just needs to be in the mood.  All I can tell you is this:  My neighbor bought some catnip and gave me some for my cats.  My cats went crazy! The female rolled in it over and over.  So I ordered some of my own. Only I couldn't remember what my neighbor brought so I ordered this one, the sojos. the Sojos did nothing at all for my cat. Sure, it was fragrant, but the cat wasn't interested.  I have ordered the exact same brand my neighbor brought over (frontier) and when it comes I will update this after the kitties try it.  I will find out if kitties are particular to brand or if they need to be in a catnip mood."
1.0,Tastes like a brown crayon,"The old recipe for 70% Lindt bars was perfect -- it was just the right balance, and my favorite dark chocolate bar at the price point.  The new one is flavorless and waxy, tastes like I'm biting into a brown crayon.  I'd rather eat a Hershey bar.  No idea what Lindt is thinking.  Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a ""smoother"" taste with a ""less intense cocoa flavor.""  Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense?"
5.0,Addictive,"I have, to date, ordered six boxes of these and every one of them has been great.  A box stuffed full of delicious Slim Jim goodness. I actually couldn't ask for anything more in life.  I worry sometimes about buying food online, but there was no difference whatsoever between these and the boxes I pick up at Wal-Mart, except that these come in at a cheaper price per stick. And that phenomenon other reviewers have mentioned, the one where you feel compelled to eat every stick in the box as soon as you can?  It's real.  And also way more dangerous with 100 Slim Jims than 15.  (But worth it.)"
1.0,Not recommended,Really had high expectations of this Kona coffee--so much so that I even gifted a couple of bags for Christmas.  I was not impressed and very much regretted gifting this coffee.
5.0,"NEVER STOP MAKING THIS PRODUCT, UDI'S!!","We could not live without this, period. Lovely texture, not crumbly or dry.  Only complaint is slices are rather small and frequently have large bubble holes."
5.0,Yummy and fresh,"We love to use these in our green smoothies. They provide sweetness and flavor, and help the body to be more alkaline. They are delicious, and we've always been happy with Angelina's Gourmet's service."
1.0,"great, but pricey","Truffle oil is excellent, but this one itself is a BAD deal. 3.5 oz is like a shot glass, a bottle of tabasco, etc.  spend $5 more and get a 9 oz bottle.."
5.0,Bread baked perfectly with barley mix,"Like other hodgson bread mix. I tried this one in zojirushi bread machine and it came out perfectly baked like a regular bread shape. ( not in the shape that is displayed on the packet,). Agree with the distinct flavor and hoping it is healthy as stated."
1.0,why buy this in Kcups!!!,"Soooo kcups are super expensive. Why buy them?? Celestial seasonings comes in individual tea bags - ""pillow"" tea bags...I just set the tea bag in the cup & use the Keurig to heat the water and dispense into the cup. MUCH CHEAPER! I also use the Ekobrew reusable filter so I can add whatever coffee I want. Works great in my Keurig Mini...love love love it. Just don't waste your $$ on Kcups. The earth will love you for it as well.  BTW the Ekobrew filter was only $12 vs the other kcup filter that runs about $20 AND I have never had a mess problem with it like reviewers of the other kcup filter.  Ohhh and to review the tea only takes two words...awesomely delicious (okay a made word and a real one).  The 1star is for the waste of money on Kcups!"
5.0,My dog is crazy for these!,My black lab absolutely loves these dog chew sticks! She will go through one in about ten minutes. They make her breath smell good and don't affect her tummy! I highly recommend them for any puppy owner!
5.0,~ Fantastic product,"We bought these wheat berries for long term food storage. They were packaged (& shipped within a box) well in the large heavy duty brown paper grain bag that is pictured above. There was practically no foreign material; very clean, and no hulls or anything. A great product at a great price. I ate a few of the berries raw, and they seemed good. I cooked some a few nights ago and they tasted great. Currently, I'm sprouting a small batch, and all is going well.  Thank you, Great River Organic Milling!!"
5.0,Excellent Organic Green Tea,"The previous reviewer did not read the description, nor pay attention to the picture on the tin.  The tin clearly shows both green tea leaves, and matcha powder. The product description also clearly states that this product is ""organic green tea powder known as matcha with fine, organic green leaf tea"". In other words, the tea bag contains green tea leaves, along with a bit of matcha powder.  It is an excellent tea if you are the casual tea drinker, or someone looking for a healthy, tasty and organic green tea (with a bit of added benefit of the matcha powder). If you are a true matcha drinker, then this is not the product for you.  I find this to be an excellent organic green tea."
5.0,Organo Gold Coffee from Amazon -  a winner!!,Love this product and enjoy the taste.  I recommend only one per day as it does have a de-toxifying effect. The Latte tastes wonderful and is a personal favorite. The Organo Gold Black Coffee has no bitter after taste at all.  I normally use creamer but could drink this without it if I had to. Will order from the same seller as before and probably buy the Organo Gold Black since it is a little more economical with 30 packets per box. Excellent product and great taste!
1.0,The worst tasting miso soup I have ever had,"Let me start out by saying that I love miso soup, I could and sometimes do eat it every day. And I am not a miso soup snob, either, I  enjoy various brands/ recipes. I, however, found this particular brand to be a dud - lacking any flavor whatsoever and packed with way too much onion. It may have fine quality ingredients, which is the reason I bought it in the first place, but it does not deliver in the taste department. Disclaimer: I do understand tastes differ."
1.0,Manufacturer put WRONG food in can!,"Because of all the good reviews about Blue Buffalo dog food, I've been using this (expensive) dog food for about 6 months. I have 2 large dogs so sometimes I go through 5 cans a day. I've mostly purchased through Amazon. This past order, I opened a can of  Chicken Pot Pie which is supposed to be 'chunk' style with clearly identifiable peas, potatoes, etc. This time, I opened a can and it was mush food. Not knowing how it got messed up in the processing plant, I did not feed it to my dogs (thus losing the $2.30 that I paid for the can). I immediately went to Amazon.com AND Blue Buffalo and wrote to their customer service departments about this. NEITHER company has contacted me back and that was 3 weeks ago! So, I decided to start randomly opening the other cans (they all came in one 12-can carton that was wrapped in plastic) to see if all the cans were wrong.  Fortunately, they were not wrong so somehow the company mislabeled one of the cans during processing. The reason that this could be extremely dangerous for us is if it was beef as one of my dogs has so many bowel issues after eating beef that I only give him poultry and fish products.  Luckily, I did not feed them this can and threw it away.  However, this has tarnished my trust in this company. At the very least, either AMAZON or Blue Buffalo should have responded to my concerns. I've been waiting to get an email asking for my 'review' because I feel this is the only forum that will give any attention to this potential problem that other people could experience. My dogs are precious to me and I go to great lengths to exercise and nourish them which means I have to put trust in other companies to help me do just that. I'm now looking for homemade dog food receipes and have started making some myself this past week. I hope this was helpful to you."
5.0,Great Product,"The product was delivered on time, just as I ordered and reasonably priced!  What more can you ask for?  Thanks!"
1.0,It's not real black sesame,These seeds smell bad and fade in water. It turns pure water into black ink. I highly doubt the safty of this product. Try to avoid these weired seeds.
5.0,Cats love it,"I have 6 feral cats that I trapped, neutered/spayed and released.  They still hang around our property so of course we feed them.  They really like 9 lives and I believe it is good for them.  Being old and my husband handicapped, it is so easy for us to have it delivered right to our door step instead of wrestling with the bags at the store and unloading when we get home.  I am very satisfied with the product and Amazon.  The subscribe and save option is even better as I don't have to remember to order it."
1.0,This stuff was terrible,"For over a year now I've purchased coconut water from Amazon via subscription.  I usually purchase coconut water ""O.N.E"", but my subscription was cancelled due to me being deployed.  Once I returned home I decided to purchase Naked coconut water, and wow I was so disappointed.  The taste of this coconut water is horrible, just horrible.  This was suppose to be Pineapple flavor, and it really sucked.  There was no flavor to it at all, but it tasted like old dish water.  I still have these in my frig, because I can't bring myself to drink them.  They are over a month old, and I will probably just wash them down the drain.  They where not what I had expected, and I had to get back on Amazon to find the other brand of coconut water.  I have now found another subscription of ""O.N.E"", and I'm very happy with them.  No more Naked coconut water, it taste horrible."
5.0,Wine.com California Bounty Gift Basket,Sent to my sister as a gift and she said it was great and with her being a wine drinker that is a good thing:-)
5.0,Good stuff,I am new to these oils but Walnut Oil has its own unique taste that is very refreshing. I like it a lot.
5.0,My favorite milk shake now available at Amazon,"I have enjoyed Alba milk shakes for a very long time, but for many years I have found it difficult or impossible to find in groceries and supermarkets.  This has puzzled me- why has such a great product been hidden from the public?  Fortunately I found it on the internet at Amazon and was able to purchase it, but it would be so much easier if retail stores carried it.  Anyway, I'm glad to be able to get it any way I can, but it's a strange way to do business."
5.0,Better then Cavit,This wine is truly AMAZiNG!!!!! I love Cavit & this taste exactly like it!!!!I'm a fan for life!And it's wonderful price!!8.99 for a big bite!!You gotta try it!!!
5.0,The perfect licorice!,"I'm a black licorice lover and I think I've found the perfect licorice in these money coins.  I like a chewy licorice with lots of flavor, not too sweet and not too salty, and this ticks all the boxes.  K&H have hit a home run in my book."
1.0,NOT what it claims,"howdy y'all,  i bought this before the previous reviewer posted. [*sigh ...*]  this is NOT bacon-y.  the package front lists ""with bacon bits"", the ingredients list ""bacon"", the product name says ""cheesy bacon macaroni"" AND there are what appear to be bacon bits on the front-of-the-package product picture. all four claims appear to be flat out, tee-total, unmitigated _lies_.  there are NO bacon bits in it. i searched the 2nd package after the 1st seemed so un-bacon-y. [*grin*] there is a vague, very faint scent of bacon in the cheese powder. there is NO bacon flavor to the finished product. i suspect there is a small amount of ""powdered, bacon-like substance"" in the package.  the finished product is also a very low quality. i've had better mac-n-cheese with no-name microwave macaroni and cheese products.  i bought an entire CASE of this ""stuff"" and the only way i can make myself eat it is by adding it to a [separately cooked] batch of this ...  Kraft Easy Mac Dinner, Extreme Cheese, 12.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)   the kraft easy mac is really quite good! [*grin*]  take care, lee"
1.0,VET WARNING!!!  DO NOT BUY!,"I bought these for years for my little guys and they loved it.  Unbeknownst to me, it turns out these things will break and crack your dogs teeth!!!  After a routine visit to the vet, he found one of my dogs had infected and broken back molars.  I guess it's a common occurrence judging by other reviewers on here.  And my vet also said he's had 8 dogs come in with the same problem in the last 2 years, all with Nylabone dental chew toys. Had to get dental work done on my baby and her teeth were extracted.  Poor gal was crying all night long after surgery.  The vet says this happens w/ large dogs too!!!  So NYLABONE needs to stop selling this item as a dental chew!  I'm going to report this directly to Amazon corporate."
5.0,Hooray it's back!,"I had Senseo Columbian coffee pods on a subscription for some time, and then suddenly it wasn't available any more...anywhere.  Just recently, I noticed that this brand and type of coffee were again available through Amazon, so I quickly ordered some.  I'm enjoying it now, and just this week placed another order.  I like the flavor of this coffee very much and hope it continues to be available, even though a subscription is not.  During the Senseo hiatus, I tried several other pod brands, but every one was too weak for my taste."
5.0,Love these bars,"Great crunch and taste.  Love the auto ship program with discount!  I can't find these in any stores in my area, was so happy to get them on Amazon."
1.0,Reeks like chemicals,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
1.0,"Yes, it is like chewing on a sponge!","I confirm another review here that perfectly describes the texture and taste of this product as like chewing on a cellulose sponge! OMG! I love tofu, by the way. This is the first tofu I've eaten in decades that I did not like.  I bought this after reading that review and thinking the person was maybe not familiar with the taste of tofu, or perhaps tried to eat this without re-hydrating this first. No, it is like chewing on a sponge (Have we all by accident done this, or is it an early childhood memory of times when we tested everything with our mouths?) At any rate, you will instantly think ""sponge"" if you ignore these warnings and buy this tofu. I do not mean just the texture, it really tastes like a cellulose sponge!  I am also a fan of Eden Foods and enjoy many of their products, they make great tamari, for instance. I was looking for that texture and taste I find in freeze dried tofu pieces that come in soup mixes as in instant miso tofu soup packets or soup cups. This isn't that tofu! It will not be wasted, it has good protein and I can chop it in very small pieces and mix it with Creamy Tomato Soup by Pacific Naturals, that makes it innocuous enough. But I'll never buy this again!  I am looking into buying a food dehydrator to make my own. The cost of tofu is much lower that this item reflects. I will update this if I have success drying my own tofu. Believe the reviews here, this isn't good."
1.0,"GROSS!  This has so much salt it IS ""junk food"" !!!","I love pumpkin seeds.  I love them so much I never thought a company that claims to offer them ""simply"" could ruin them.  ""Go Raw"" is probably a company filled with nice people, but I found this product absolutely disgusting -- that's how salty it was.  I didn't want to finish even the 1st handful of these pumpkin seeds; and after forcing myself to try several handfuls in case the first one was not representative of the whole bag, that was it.  No more for me!  I tried to give them away to other ""healthy eaters"" amongst my friends -- & I didn't tell any of them what I disliked about these pumpkin seeds, either.  Turns out I didn't have to.  Each one discovered the problem on his/her first try, too.  Hence no one wanted them any more than I did.  Any food this salty IS ""junk food"" -- and EXPENSIVE junk food, at that."
5.0,Love it!,"I love how soft this leaves my skin.  I'm using it on all my kids now too, because their skin always used to be so dry.  I also like that it is all natural."
1.0,The most taste-less Earl Grey ever,"I love drinking tea, and Earl Grey has been my choice everywhere I go.  I enjoyed brewing tea from tea leaves, a habit that I have given up for the ease of tea bags.  Twinings tea had always been my pick until this last purchase from Amazon.  Earl Grey totally lost its poignancy.  Even two bags of tea could not brew a decent cup of tea.  At first I thought it was the recent degradation of Earl Grey tea as a result of climate change etc.  Then I tasted other brand's Earl Grey and found acceptable.  I went to the length and bought another pack of Twining Earl Grey tea from a grocery store, and I tasted alright.  So I can only conclude the tastelessness of Twinings Earl Grey is associated with packages I bought from Amazon.  I found this to be true with Amazon's Darjeeling tea as well."
5.0,I wouldn't miss a day.,"I begin my day with one cup of smooth move tea-- everyday.  If I forget I make sure that I take it before I go to bed at night. It taste good. My teenaged grandsons like it.  It depends on how blocked you are which will determine how it works.  You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all."
5.0,Great  for stir fry,This sauce is labeled as a braising sauce but I use it for Chinese stir fry.  It has the best flavor I have found for this purpose.
5.0,"Tastes the most like ""regular"" pasta","We have tried all kinds of pasta -- quinoa, whole wheat, veggie, etc.  This was the first pasta where my husband and I both liked it and could hardly tell the difference with regular pasta.  We have five kids.  Three out of five can't tell the difference.  One hates all pasta and the other will eat it as long as their is sauce on it.  We make a big batch and reheat in the microwave.  It holds up nicely and doesn't dry out like regular pasta.  Highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative to regular noodles."
1.0,not what I expected,"I was very disappointed that it was not clear from the label that this quinoa product is actually corn and quinoa.  I cannot eat corn.  There is enough corn in it that it should be called quinoa-corn pasta. I usually read the labels very closely, but I missed this ingredient.  I guess because I know there quinoa cereal is just quinoa.  So I have a stack of food I can't eat. Lots of people who look for quinoa are gluten intolerant.  Corn sensitivity is also very common.  I hope they'll make their label more clear."
5.0,Crispy Rice Love,"So, you're gluten free and you can't eat oats, and maybe there's a corn allergy and or incipient diabetes and all the gluten-free rice cereals have huge amounts of sugar, and what the heck can you eat for breakfast?  This.  It's truly gluten-free, has no sugar, it's not gross, and it's cheap.  Also, being a non-oat eating celiac without incipient diabetes I was looking for a base for homemade honey peanutbutter breakfast bars because gluten free things like Lara Bars cost $1.50 each.  I think I may have found the missing ingredient.  Very cool."
1.0,Defective seal,"The coffee had a nice bold, flavor, but the foil on the cups were not properly sealed, and I mean all of the cups. Every brewing left grounds in the cup and sometimes made a complete mess because the water wasn't going through the brew tip.  The flavor of the coffee was not enough to warrant a better rating because we get this product for convenience and easy clean up, as much as for the flavor."
5.0,Don't eat these unless you want a new addiction,"I have been buying out the stock of these cookies at every Stop & Shop and King Kullen in my area for quite some time!! They put out 12 boxes-I buy 12 boxes-until they raised the price so much in 2 years that I sought out other methods of satisfying my addiction. Amazon to the rescue!!! The subscription service is a wonderful thing-brings the price down to $2.11/box-when they are now $3.69 in my local supermarket-(if you can find them). And FREE SHIPPING!!  Finding this service was my refuge to keep these cookies in my life without going into ""cookie bankruptcy""-with  my food budget.  LOVE THEM!!"
1.0,MADE IN CHINA,"I was looking for dog treats on Amazon that aren't made in China and Dingo came up.  I've checked this brand before and unless they've changed where they manufacture Dingo's from, they care made in China."
1.0,CELIACS BEWARE !  CONTAINS GLUTEN !,"Despite the fact that the ""nutritional information"" on Amazon states that this product is only herring, water, and salt, the cans state that GLUTEN is part of the deal.  I am feeding my cans to my dogs, who incidentally love the flavor. BTW, what the hell is gluten doing in a can of fish?"
5.0,Wonderful for a Manhattan,Absolutely the best cherry for a Manhattan.  Please note the jar is labeled 'not fit for consumption'. This notice is due to the presence of alcohol in the product. Similar notices can be found on pure vanilla extract. The product is safe to consume.
1.0,OMG--Yuck!,"Oh my goodness... Although I have to give Crystal Lights a thumbs-up for trying to come up with diet water flavorings in more adult flavors (Margarita, Mojito, Appletini or whatever), unfortunately this stuff is just awful!  First of all, why would they package this in a pitcher-sized packet?  Do you really think you are going to have a bunch of girlfriends over and serve them a pitcher of Crystal Light non-alcoholic Mojitos?  Why not package it the same way they package all their other Crystal Light products, in individual-sized packets that you can stir into one bottle or glass of water?  The only market I can see for this product is if you should happen to belong to a Weight Watchers/AA group where you need to serve a pitcher of diet ""mocktails"" to a group of people who are trying to lose weight.  Okay, so they missed on the product packaging (and had a misguided focus group)...but what about the taste?  I have to admit that there are some Crystal Light flavors that I do like and enjoy putting into my water.  I'm especially fond of the Pink Lemonade mix.  But this Mojito mix is just awful--the taste is at the same time bland, metallic, sour (and not in a good way), stale-tasting, and leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and (worst of all) tastes nothing like any Mojito I've ever had.  I cannot imagine what they were thinking!  The recipe must have been formulated by people without tastebuds.  Believe me, this is not a product you will buy more than once, and take my advice and skip it altogether!"
5.0,Colin,"I am not a big popcorn eater (my daughter and wife are), but this is just like the movie popcorn and cheaper!!!"
1.0,not as expected,Didn't taste like I thought it should.  Kinda awful. It went into the garbage.
1.0,Disappointed in Salba,"I purchased 3 bottles of the Salba--the  single bottle's protective seal was not securely attached to the bottle so I threw that bottle away. I should have returned it.  Have used some of the Salba and while it does not change the taste of whatever you mix with it, I have not noticed any results of increased energy, lower blood sugars etc.  Perhaps I was expecting too much."
1.0,Gummy bear pasta at best!!!!!!!!!,"This was the poorest pasta I have ever eaten. If you follow instructions and boil pasta for 4-6 minutes you'll have a snowball of mush. I purchased 6 boxes and experimented with all six (just wanted to get rid of them). I cooked the pasta in separate batches for 3,4,5,6,7 and eight minutes. All were terrible. Dear Hodgson why are there 2 types of pasta in each box? One half linguine and one half curly long pasta. Please go back to the drawing board and try again. The worst whole wheat pasta is ten times better than this product. Never again."
5.0,A quality product,"We are so pleased to be able to buy xylitol made from birch trees right here in the U.S. and not from corn in China.  The price is slightly more but well worth the peace of mind knowing that it is a quality product.  If in doubt, visit Emerald Forest website."
5.0,Yum Yum,Awesome product must try! Sushi tastes like candy heaven and the food is just half the fun! With the experience of making your own candy it is a must do!
1.0,The Change was not for the Better,"Ovaltine has changed its formula, and the change is definitely NOT for the better! True, they now include more vitamins - but at a paltry little 10%, with riboflavin B2, and vitamin B12 at 0%! (Why they even bother to list it on the container is beyond me), and phosporus has been reduced to 4%. The previous formula included higher percentages: vitamin A 45%, vitamin C 45%, calcium 8%, iron 15%, thiamine B1 60%, riboflavin B2 45%, niacin 45%, vitamin B6 45%, and phosphorus 8%. In short, they took something that was fairly healthy, and in the typical manner of American corporations, cheapened it into nothing more than junk-food milk-flavoring! I quoted the above percentages from an Ovaltine container from last year. Ovaltine is worthless now and I refuse to buy it until they return it to its orginial formula. I will be writing the company about this, too. They obviously think we're all stupid, and I boycott any company that acts like it thinks I'm stupid!"
5.0,A real coffee drinker's coffee,"I consider this the best k-cup coffee out there for real coffee drinkers.  At least for those who want a nice bold cup of coffee like Starbucks used to have before they went to the all McDonald's like ""Pike's Place Roast"" all day policy. The boldest and most flavorful of all K-cups. This is great coffee. I brew two K-cups to fill up my cup first at the smallest cup and the second at the middle cup and it is still nice and bold, tastes great. In the afternoon I brew two at the smallest cup size."
1.0,disappointing,The color was off white and the contents cloyingly sweet--it looked spoiled.  It was not at all what I expected and given the opportunity I would return it. It  is a food so I am stuck with it but would never order it again and will likely have difficulty ever using it ---thank goodness it's shelf like is a few years
5.0,Delightful surprise,"I've got a Keurig for my dorm room and I usually just buy a sampler box because I don't really have a preference for any one of the coffees. However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot. I have to say I'm absolutely infatuated with Jet Fuel. I definitely like my coffee strong, as a previous Starbucks Barista, and the undertones of chocolate are wonderful for my sweet tooth. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes bold coffee, people who prefer something like a breakfast blend would probably find Jet Fuel to be too bitter. I also like that there's no excess packaging. I ordered the same size box of breakfast blend for my mother and I swear I could have fit in the box it came in!"
5.0,This will be a real help ...,"Wow - I just tried this this morning. I love both vanilla and caramel, so thought how bad could this be? I am not normally a fan of warm drinks, but I am trying to break my soda habit. This tea will go a long way in helping me break this habit!  I have tried it plain, with sweetener and with sweetener/milk combo. I like just the sweetener the best, but of course, everyone has different tastes.  I don't really taste a whole lot of vanilla, but there is a definite caramel taste, which is why I loved it so much. This one will be on my regular list to buy from here on out!  Great job, Bigelow! You have converted me from Celestial Seasonings!"
1.0,Pretzels,"To be honest, I did not get the Utz pretzels, Special Sourdough I ordered.  I got some type of pretzel that was totally not what I ordered.  I was really, really disappointed because I was going to have these pretzels at work.  I figured it was going to be too expensive to send them back so I kept them.  I am not going to order anything like this again in the future because I was so disppointed."
1.0,DEFECTIVE SEALS - DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT ORDER.  I recently received this order and the K-Cups have a defective seal that blows liquid out of the side all over my counter.  I do not have this issue with more expensive store bought K-Cups, so Amazon has obviously changed to a cheaper manufacturer to make it's prices.  Buyer be ware!"
1.0,Not good,"I picked this up at my local Rite Aid. It was only a dollar for an 8pk, so I decided to try them. The fact that I could not find an exp. date should have been a warning. These are horrible, hard and firm like jujube, and leaves a nasty too-sweet-almost-bitter aftertaste. Global Brands is batting 0 for 2 so far. Their Sweet Obsession Dark Chocolate is also far off the mark."
1.0,Only received one worn packet,"Although the description said 3 large packets, I only received one.  It was wrinkled and worn; I would not feel good about giving it as a gift. I contacted the supplier directly to try and resolve the issue, and never received a response.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this purchase, and would never buy from this supplier again."
5.0,Fast shipping,There are lots of sellers to choose when I am buying the chocolate but I think I make the right choice! I choose regular shipping and it takes only 3 days for me to receive the package! That's so nice and the product looks so great!
5.0,Horseradish ketchup!,"Great service, fast delivery.I have recently discovered the joy of horseradish and this kechup is amazing on chicken and turkey sandwiches. Thanks"
1.0,contains a lot of dirt,"The earthy taste of the tea comes from the dozens of rice size clumps of dirt left behind when the leaves are fully open.  These are partial leaves wraped around dirt. Not only do I not recommend this to fellow tea lovers, I do not recommend this be consumed. The quality control on the their gunpowder process is less than adequate by western standards."
1.0,Much too dry,"On two occasions when I called AMAZON I mentioned that the Shredded Wheat I had received in two separate shipment was extremely dry. Although the product itself is admittedly dry, the condition in which these two shipments were found was way beyond dry. In fact, they were both stale.  I was offered a refund the two times I mentioned the condition of this product but I turned down the offers. I do not think it fair to use a product such as these and then be given back my payment. Instead I just cancelled further deliveries."
5.0,"Great coffee, strong enough for Re-brew","We use this coffee in our Keurig.  My husband likes strong coffee and I like weak.  These pods give us both what we want... he brews his cup then I brew the same pod again and it is still coffee, just weaker.  It saves us money... most of the other pods we've tried aren't strong enough to do a re-brew."
1.0,How do you cut down on fat and calories?  they add water!,I had to laugh when I saw the ingredients in the light version of the Coconut milk. The first ingredient is water!! All the other ingredients are the same. Thats how they reduce the calories. There is no water in the regular version and the price is the same in stores. If you want to reduce calories simply buy the full fat version for the same price and add water! You'll save money!
1.0,VERY LITTLE TASTE. NOT HAPPY.,"I WAS VERY MUCH IN HOPES THAT THESE CRACKERS WOULD HAVE VERY GOOD, UNIQUE TASTE, BUT HOPES WERE DIMINISHED WITH THE FIRST BITE!!! I HAVE PURCHASED THE KEEBLER CHEESE & PEANUT BUTTER CRACKERS SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY HAVE VERY GOOD TASTE AND ARE HEAD AND SHOULDER'S ABOVE THE PB & J TYPE.  BOTTOM LINE.......I WILL NOT EAT ANY MORE OF THESE AND WILL NOT PURCHASE ANY MORE OF THEM. THE OTHER KEEBLER PRODUCTS ARE GOOD, BUT THIS ONE IS VERY SAD IN DEED. I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A REFUND ON THIS ORDER."
5.0,I'll buy this again!,"I discovered this product while reading about the Fat Belly Cure by Jorge Cruise. This soda is sweetened with stevia, a natural sweetener that Jorge endorses. I love cream soda so I thought this was worth a try. Having this on hand helps me avoid drinking sugared colas and diet pops with harmful artificial sweeteners. It is so good that I haven't even missed my Dr. Pepper. If you like A & W Cream Soda, you'll like this. The price is a little more that what I spend on a can of soda, but it's worth it knowing I am taking one step closer to better health."
1.0,wrong item ordered,"I thought I was ordering the large sugar crystals used on top of products like fruit turnovers, as sold in bakeries.   Natural Turbinado Sugar Crystals   I wish the picture of the close up was larger or it had been shown on a bakery item."
1.0,Taste like burnt something or other.,"I'm sorry, but these are horrible!  They taste burnt!  They are so bitter that neither my husband or I were able to eat them.  I tried them three different times because I didn't want to give up so easily, but they really are just awful.  It's not just a 'deep' flavor, they truly do taste burnt.  Won't buy again."
1.0,disappointed in NJ,"The scratcher is very flimsy. Each time my cat would scratch it would move and drag along without allowing  the cat to get a good scratching, even tough it was on top a carpet to reduce sliding. Also makes a big mess as the scratching occurs. The paper toy was even flimsier and destroyed in 5 minutes."
5.0,Gluten Free Dream Flour,"When I first became gluten free I tried to mix different flours (rice, tapioca, sorghum, etc) but cakes were always dense.  This is a close as you can get to real flour.  Still need xanthum gum.  cakes a light.  also their pizza mix is great.  we cook the crust a little to make it crispy and then at the sauce, cheese, and toppings."
5.0,Great Smooth Flavor,"I just started drinking tea other than Lipton Tea bags as I'm trying to cut back on my coffee and I have to say this tea has a wonderful taste. It is not harsh, its light and smooth taste. I also make my own tea and use half Lipton tea bags and two - three of the Grey Earl and it gives it a wonderful taste. If you want something that is light and smooth and smells great too, this is the tea for you!"
1.0,I love this stuff!,"I love this stuff! but, this sellers price is unbelieveable. That equates to well over $7.00 per box! I can get them at my grocery store for $5 a box .. and even that was expensive.  I used to buy them on amazon for about $3 per box, shipped to my house. Unfortunately amazon stopped selling it altogether, let alone under the save + subscribe umbrella. So, I have stopped drinking this great product!  Oh well. ... will find some other caffinated thing to dump in my water.  Dont waste your money supporting this seller, whatever you do"
5.0,"Delicious, this makes a meal!","I've bought this product many times in the supermarket. The Amazon price is much better than what I have ever paid for the same item. It's nice to have on the shelf because my family will always eat tortellini. The fresh tortellini that you buy in the refrigerator case has a different, fresher, taste; however, this is still delicious and great to have on hand. All you need to do is boil it, toss it in some butter, maybe add a little bit of tomato sauce (not much) and some grated cheese (not much). With a salad, that's a good, satisfying dinner!"
1.0,Bitter Regrets,"This chocolate doesn't taste like it's sweetened at all.  If Stevia is supposed to be twice as sweet as real sugar, then why didn't Lucienne put enough sugar in their bars?  It's bitter and tastes like baking chocolate.  Bluuukkkk."
1.0,Seller lies about quantity,"Love Tim Tams, but as with previous buyer, I felt the quantity was extremely misleading, akin to a straight up lie.  I am pretty sure when I purchased the item, it even had an estimated price per package as ~$2 (based on the ll packages number.)  Very disappointed.  Wish I had read the other review first."
5.0,2010 harvest oil is wonderful!,"Have been a fan of Oliotaibi olive oil for a couple years now.  Just got four bottles of the new batch from last summer's harvest, and it is absolutely outstanding.  We use it on salads and when cooking, but it is best for dipping with a good, hearty artisan bread.  Haven't found anything else that compares to this oil, in terms of taste and richness."
5.0,Tasty Snack,Pocky Sticks have been a favorite snack of mine for a long time. It's great that it can be ordered and delivered to me whenever I want.
5.0,Great!!!,"Until my daughter realized there is real food available, I was able to cut down to 2 bottles instead of her normal 4 because of this product."
1.0,overrated,A real disappointment. I normally buy Kirkland Signature dried montmorency cherries from Costco. The Costco cherries have a much brighter flavor and a nice tart sweet snap at the end. These taste dull almost raisin like initially with a hint of cherry at the end.
1.0,"Sadly, IT DID NOT WORK ON SQUIRRELS!","At first, it seemed to work but after a few days the squirrels attacked.  I was forced to spray every two days. Then, one day, just hours after spraying , I saw a squirrel romping through and digging in the sprayed garden,  So I.m back to seeking a real solution!"
5.0,Outstanding coffee,"We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.  Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure. Flavor is full and robust, but not at all bitter. It's hard to describe it's smoothness without hyperbole, but try it once and you'll find yourself at a loss for words also. If you are used to the strength of a French press but want the silky smoothness of a breakfast blend, this coffee is for you.  Vacuum packed into foil bricks for freshness. Do yourself, your spouse, and your office mates a huge favor and give it a try - and be prepared to start writing your own five star review."
1.0,What Happened???,This review is actually written in Sept of 2011. The original was a glowing review but apparently I'm not allowed to review the same product twice. Really Amazon? This jerky used to be so good and now it's the weirdest ever. The packaging that used to be so easy to open is now impossible without scissors. The jerky itself is like squares of hard rubber that are nearly impossible to chew.I bought my usual boxes of original and teriaki and the flavors were almost identical. After years of being a fan (especially my husband who doesn't eat beef)I'm so disappointed in whoever is responsible for destroying a great product. To whoever designed the new packaging....you need to go back to the drawing board. How about the original? It was perfect on all counts as it was. From 5 stars to 1. Barely.
1.0,High fructose corn syrup,"I stumble upon this product at Walmart and bought it without looking at the ingredients, thinking that it uses sugar. I was surprised to find out later on that this product lists high fructose corn syrup on the third in the ingredients list. If you don't care consuming HFCS, then disregard this feedback. For me, HFCS is totally out of consideration."
5.0,The Ultimate Tortilla Chip!,"These T-chips are 'finestkind'...light, fresh, flavorful, and healthy, to boot. Dip these things in some chilled salsa verde and you'll be well on yer way. The only suggestions I would offer are to tone-down the lime a bit, possibly use a key lime, and to lighten-up on the salt. Incidentally, someone wrote in about the problem of a few crushed chips in their shipment...hey, ""no hay problema""...isn't that why The Great Spirit created chili?"
1.0,New and Improved Recipe anything BUT improved.,"I have been eating this stuff since the '70s or shall I say HAD been. They now only have the New and Improved Recipe which is terrible!  I thought it went bad-- then I see on the box, new and improved. Who approved this. Anyone remember New Coke--- well, I see this happening again only with Quaker, Inc.  I will no longer buy this stuff until they go back to the old recipe."
5.0,Best Cookie !,"I got a pack of Byron Bay Chocolate cookie as a Christmas gift. It is the best cookie I ever had. Did not know it was Gluten Free, but I am not allergic. Have some English Tea with this cookie, so good!!!"
5.0,Wow!!,"We have two kittens and have been using The Worlds Best Cat Litter since adopting them.  I only had one problem with the WBCL, it didn't do much in the odor control department.  The whole house knew when a kitty went #2!! I saw the Swheat Scoop on the shelf at our local pet store and decided to try it.  It was almost $10 cheaper too.  After cleaning our litter boxes we refilled them with Swheat Scoop.  There was less dust and otherwise looked and felt the same as the WBCL.  The kittens had no objection to the new litter.  I was excited to see that this litter clumps harder and stays together when scooped.  And it works wonders on the #2 smell!! I will use the Swheat Scoop from now on!!"
1.0,K.O. sardines packed in Poland; Bumble Bee distributor,"No longer does the KO sardine label brag about brislings from the icy Norwegian fjords. This inferior sardine is being sold at the premium price of yesteryear in a KO label. In fact, I have read the labels of every brisling sardine fishery on my grocer's shelf, and found them all wanting. Perhaps the near-arctic waters' brislings have been depleted...or the fisheries don't want to spend the money on the diesel fuel to get them there?"
5.0,Most fantastic fresh tasting marmalade,"If you are going to buy one marmalade or jam in your life, let this be it.  It is absolutely fantastic taste and consistency.  Some marmalade is too thick and too sweet, but not this marmalade.  It is perfect in every way."
1.0,Rip Off,"I bought this product in the plastic tray format, and when I got home and opened the package I was in for a suprise.  Not only was the product no where near as good as I remembered it to be, but it had a 3"" by 4"" label smack dab in the middle of the front.  When I opened it, yup, no candy underneath the label.  Talk about 'false advertising'.  Will never buy these again just on principle.  This company evidently doesn't care about a loyal following.  Fool me once..."
5.0,Helpful and great tasting,"We have been cutting back on caffeine as my husband has a caffeine related heart irregularity. This is perfect, he gets just a little caffeine and I get great tasting coffee with no difficulty and all on 1 cup."
5.0,Teddy Grahams,Very vast delivery of Teddy Grahams Snacks. If you haven't tried them I suggest that you try them and you will be hooked on them as I am. I take a bag to work to share with coworkers. Just GREAT.
1.0,salty," Kraft Blue Box Macaroni & Cheese, 7.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 15)  Too much salt.  Any food with excessive salt in it will react with my medicine and cause my ankles to swell to elephant size. So,  please, cut down on the salt;  maybe just a little means a lot. Remember 'Bones' in Star Trek?  He used too much of something when he could hve used a smaller amount.  Thanks,  Jim S."
1.0,TOO SWEET TOO SMALL GOT THE WRONG THING,"I HAD THIS TUB OF BUBBLE GUM. WHEN I FINISHED IT I ORDERED ANOTHER, I THOUGHT THE GUM WAS CALLED DUBBLE BUBBLE, BUT WHEN I GOT IT, IT WASN'T THE SAME GUM. I WANTED SUPER BUBBLE NOT DUBBLE BUBBLE. THIS GUM  IS SICKENINGLY TOO SWEET AND IT IS TOO SMALL TO MAKE A DECENT BUBBLE"
5.0,Best Cheesecake ever!,Definitely one of the best. I was a little scared alot of people say they are the best but this was really good!
5.0,Fantastic Flavor,A perfect combination of bergamot and tea. Full bergamot flavor. the best Earl Grey tea I have had.
5.0,"My spouse and son use this almost daily, compact and very portable","If the price of this product leaves you gasping, it shouldn't. It is highly concentrated and my spouse uses it to create flavored water when plain water isn't appealing. It goes a long way. With so many Mio flavor choices, even if you don't like the peach you ought to find others you enjoy. But the peach MIO is one of our favorites.  I do think it is important to note that reviewers tend to either love or hate this product so you might want to check out a number of reviews. But for the record, we love it, have purchased more after getting a free sample, and keep a regular supply on hand.  Mostly we use this as an alternative to soft drinks and it fits nicely into our diet plan, making it easier to avoid weight gain, although we also exercise and eat a balanced diet (most of the time) . Sometimes we add this to Kefir, especially when flavored Kefir is unavailable.  Even if you can find flavored Kefirs, they often contains plenty of sugar so the Mio is an excellent way to add taste without boosting sugar levels.  If you have limited space, each container takes up very little room in your cabinets. This also makes it highly portable, adding minimal weight. The container can even be put in a backpack or purse....and no, the top doesn't open easily.  We also keep a few of these in our desks while at work. At his university, our student son uses it to flavor fizzy water. You can even get more than the 24 servings noted on the container, depending on your taste. We do use enough to have a strong taste so it doesn't last as long but sometimes we can stretch it a bit. It really depends on what food or drink you flavor and how much satisfies your taste buds.  About that taste....the peach Mio has a nice, fruity tang, very full-bodied. For those reviewers who complain about the after taste, we get around that issue by using just enough to avoid that problem. It is really that simple.Tweak the amount you use and see if that doesn't prevent any unpleasant after taste.  If you keep in mind how much space the average bottle of water of water or soda needs, this is a far better choice. For small apartments, dorm rooms, and tiny office cubicles, you can't beat this for convenience and a tiny footprint. Even when added to tap water instead of bottled or fizzy water, there is a noticeable improvement if you want some variety in the beverages you drink."
1.0,cats won't eat it,Not sure what it is - but our cats won't touch the stuff. They do tend to like seafood more - so maybe that's what it is. We have to mix it with tuna for them to eat it.
5.0,Delicious Creative Flavors,"As a fan of the ""After Dinner Linda's Lollies"" I thought I'd start a new adventure and try 48 exciting flavors. These are perfect for every occasion and especially if you crave a wide range of flavors, but don't have time to always make Coconut Cr&egrave;me Pie or run to the store for Root Beer.  Some of the flavors in this delicious 48-count box (mine arrived in a plastic bag) include: Watermelon, Buttered Popcorn, Green Apple, Caramel, Spearmint, Fruit Punch, Cotton Candy, English Toffee, Apple Cinnamon, Root Beer, Red Hot Cinnamon, Pink Lemonade, Pineapple, Peppermint (perfect), Blueberry, Wild Cherry, Milk Chocolate, Strawberry, Raspberry, Pink Grapefruit, Vanilla (so creamy), Limeade, Root Beer Float, Lemon Meringue Pie, Orangeade, Tutti-Fruity (cute and fun), Peanut Butter, Banana, Lemon Lime, Cherry Cheesecake, Butterscotch, German Chocolate Cake, Licorice, Chocolate Covered Banana, Concord Grape, Chocolate Marshmallow Sundae, Bubble Gum, Cinnamon (deliciously spicy), Pina Colada and Peach.  Sound delicious? They are all dreamy sweet and smooth and taste delicious. One of the lollipops actually has coconut in it, so that is the only one I've noticed so far that had an interesting texture. I'd love to be able to buy a bag of any specific flavor - because you may notice you have favorites!  A lollipop for every mood and occasion! Also try the Dessert and After Dinner varieties to get the full range of flavors.  ~The Rebecca Review, enjoying Banana Cr&egrave;me Pie"
1.0,What a mistake!,"After trying the Caledonian Kitchen Irish Whiskey Cake, I found it dull and a disappointment to a palate that has been gifted with some of Britons finest Cakes. It is not moist as it should be. It has only a slight hint of Whiskey certainly not obtained from the top shelf. It became pasty as I permitted it to blend in my mouth. The pecans are ground so fine they are lost in the breading and produce only a hint of flavour. If one was to remove the Irish Whiskey from this product you would have a basic run of the mill raisin nut cake that is best eaten with a tall glass of milk to assist in washing it down. In my years I have had numerous authentic Irish Whiskey Cakes including living 3 years in the midlands of England. Tasting a good Irish whiskey cake will initially produce a moist nutty texture on the tongue followed by a moderate but not over powering bath of Irish Whiskey to the palate. It blends with the saliva and becomes similar to a bread pudding texture almost immediately complimented by the raisins. As one swallows, the aroma of the Whiskey remains in the mouth and can be sensed in the nose. It should be moderately sweet, the Whiskey delicate, and the nuts and raisins a compliment to the texture. Even at the low price I would not purchase this product again as it insults the refined integrity of a traditional Irish Whiskey Cake. Most Irish Whiskey cakes will cost you in the neighborhood of $15-20 per pound. I would regard this product to a good Irish Whiskey cake the same as Meatloaf to a Prime Rib."
5.0,The Best I Have Found,"I'm a big fan of dark chocolate, and have tried several kinds of ""dark"" hot chocolate. This is my favorite one. It is even better than Godiva's. There is an interesting review on here about how Ghirardelli changed (and worsened) the recipe. That is unfortunate, but I still think it is the best."
1.0,yuk,I bought this tea for the health benefits but couldn't stand the taste.  I couldn't drink it.  Had to give it away and won't buy it again.
5.0,nerdatheart,"I have been useing this brand and making my yogurt for about 3 mths I guess. We love the fact u can add your own items to suite your taste buds for that day. The #1 favorite is making smothies( out of this world). I do not know the screen name, but there is one reviewer that gives a lot of great tips that work very well. So take your time to read some of the longer reviews and u just might get some great hints. One I did try and worked just fine was using one side of the package for every 2 qts. So if you make 4 qts, just take out one envolope and cut both sides open and mix, u get the same thickness and great taste as if u used 1 per qt like the directions say too. So that means I get 2 times as much yogurt, then I would if I go by the directions. I even have a little yogurt fan, I make him about 2 qts every 2 weeks, and he loves it ( he is 5), him and his mommy enjoy making smothies also. When he started getting low he will come and ask me to make him more. So even kids love it. I use whole milk, heat it to 180F ( hold it at 180 for about 10min), then let it cool to about 105, mix the cultures in and then place in the qt jars. I turn my oven on for a short min or less at 350 ( place my candy temp gage to make sure it is at 105 to 110), turn the oven light on, and set the jars in ( put them more in the back), at one hr I turn the oven back on 350 for less then 40sec,( test your oven to see how fast it heats up, every oven is different, so yours may get a lot hotter faster then mine) check to make sure the temp is still good (105 to 110). I may do it one or two more times if I remember to. I find this makes my yogurt thicker, then if I do not do a quick reheat. But make sure u do not get the temp to high or u will kill your culture. Mine set in about 4 hours, but we like a little more sour taste so I leave it 6 to 8 hours. Then put it in the refrig, and eat up the next morning. There is so many ways u can rest your yogurt, just find one that works for u, the oven just happens to work for me. YouTube is another place to get hints."
1.0,Tastes like c**p,"I bought this salami at Costco, thinking this may be a great way to experience dry salami made in the Italian way. What a major disappointment. Both my wife and I think the taste is terrible, almost spoiled. Now, I love salami. I'm a salami lover. I've eaten a salami sandwich every day for the last three years. Every day!!!!! I buy most of my hard salami at Sam's Club from a vendor called Castle Wood. It 's not as good nor as inexpensive as their previous vendor called Margherita, but it's pretty similar in taste. But, after tasting this product carefully, I'm getting pretty close to simply chucking the remainder of this Columbus dry Italian salame (why do they insist on spelling it this way) in the trash. What a waste. Don't waste your money like I did."
5.0,Best flavor!,I grew up with these as a kid in Germany and I love the flavors! They taste very natural and I think much better than starburst.
1.0,Disappointed,"As a brazilian woman, I was disappointed with this. I first bought this at Whole Foods, was delicious and refresh. I was happy to see this brand at amazon, but the taste is not the same, do not taste coconut water. I have strange taste like smoke flavor. Leaving too far from Brazil I am sad that I can not have my coconut water in the morning."
1.0,More like dessert than coffee,"Never tasted this coffee before, I felt much too sweet even for dessert.  I would not order again. But then that is only my opinion.  My friend's husband loves it. I gave them to him."
5.0,Excellent flavor and texture!,"I add a tablespoon of this to my cold cereal every morning. Perfect blend of flavor and texture. Not too 'bitey', not too gritty. The flavor is not overpowering but you know it's there. Can even be eaten directly out of the bag, although I would not recommend doing it this way :-) Great as a ice-cream topping too. Shop around before purchasing though. I paid almost 50% less per 16oz pack at the supermarket, so this is not a good deal at all, unless you live in an area where it's simply not available at your local store."
1.0,stale and moldybtasting,"Have been buying these without looking  the box. I got one box and the bars were broken, stale and moldy tasting.  I looked for an expiration date, and  I noticed they were madi in CHINA. WTF. Not buying these anymore. Blecht."
5.0,Echinacea tea for Immune support,Nice Tea. Started drinking it for the cold season. I have not been sick at all this winter so maybe it did the trick.
1.0,Horrible product,Comes with no trap set up instructions. I am not dumb and neither are my brothers and neighbors. Nobody could figure out how to set it up
1.0,Oily and Salty,"Positves: All natural (that we know of)  Negatives: fattening, oily, salty, weak/weird cheese flavor, gives me a headache after eating them  I meant to order the other Barabra's Cheese Puffs 5.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12). They are salty and oily too, but they at least taste good. These are too dense to be puffs. I will not purchase these again.  I will not order from Barbara's Bakery anymore. It is owned by a state-owned Chinese company called Bright Foods based in Shanghai. Do your research. Barbara's Bakery is owned by Weetabix Limited which is owned by the Chinese government. No wonder why the quality of Barbara's Bakery has gone down hill."
1.0,Really,"I tried This Stuff Not Once But Twice, And It Was Disgusting Every Time. Actually Most Hamburger Helpers And Tuna Helper Meals Are Disgusting. I actually Cook Asian Food from scratch And Only Tried It Because I Was Curious. I guess If you can't cook this may suit you other wise don't go into the light."
5.0,Still like it and want to buy more!!,"To all of you who complained about this product - thanks a lot!! And I do mean that sarcastically..as I would like to buy more and now it is unavailable to me because of the reviews of some.  Companies have consistently changed or ""improved"" products through the years and this is just another example.  I really find it hard to believe that I can no longer purchase this because Amazon put a stop to it due to immature whining!! I may have to take my business elsewhere because I LIKED it just as well this way and my cans still said 60 calories!!"
1.0,A rubber eraser tastes better...,"High rating left me with high hopes. A case of these things arrived and I was giddy to say the least. Tearing into the package, I took a bite. It was horrible. Tasted like card board. Figured maybe it was a dud, I later tried another. Again, same taste.  While at work, my roommate who is a huge fan of pickled sausages wanted to try it. I told him to try it and give it a 1 - 10 rating. He rated it a zero, and said it tasted like dog food.  My sister wanted to try it, so I let her try it. She spit it out and threw the thing away, saying it tasted god awful.  I had my mother try it. She took a bite, leaned out the window and spit it out. I threw away that one too. She said it tasted like rubber.  Out of four pickled sausages I have had, I rate these the lowest. Its simple horrible. I'm not sure what to do with the remaining case. If no one likes them, I don't see how I can get rid of them without just tossing them, and I hate wasting food like that. Maybe the cats under my house will eat it...  Maybe the whole thing is a dud. Maybe these things are 50 years old and near expiration. I don't know. Maybe its just that our family and friends have our own taste. Whatever it is, its horrible."
1.0,I give up!!!,I was supposed to get 12 boxes of wine gums but only received 1.  I sent an e- mail to Amazon and they said that they would replace the order.  3 days later I received another single box of candy. I called on the phone next and spoke to a customer service representative who assured me that all 12 packs were in the single 8 ounce box.  I finally gave up and ordered my wine gums from E bay. The candy was fine but I never received the full order.  I am happy to say that this the only problem that I have ever had with Amazon.
5.0,The world's best cold remedy.,"The product description calls the Orangettes ""Belgian Vitamin C.""  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.  I don't know if these guys are really going to improve your health, but they will definitely improve your day.  In my opinion, they're worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one-time try.  The packaging is a gold box, wrapped in blue and white Leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box.  For shipping, the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell.  Mine arrived within three days and looked like I'd purchased them at the store to give as a gift."
1.0,It's no 5 Hour Energy,"I found no benefit in taking the Kirkland Energy Shot where the 5 hour Energy has me going in a few of minutes.  In my daily work day, I take half the bottle when I yawn for the first time after I get to work - about 2 hours after I arrive.  I take the remaining about 5 hours later.  The 5 Hour Energy keeps me going all day without any lags.  The Kirkland product did nothing.  I don't drink coffee."
1.0,It just doesn't work!,"I've tried this product several times.  It just doesn't work for me, as for so many others.  I'm an avid baker, and hate moths.  These 'traps' can be up for weeks, and not catch a single moth - while I see moths in my kitchen!  I put in another brand, and the trap fills in a week.  Sorry Safer - maybe you need more product development?"
5.0,Great for a reduced caffine product,"I just want to say that this is a really good product.  I don't know why anyone would say that it tastes like ""dishwater"".  If you are looking for really strong coffee. ie; Starbucks then you probably won't like this.  It is a mild blend but very tasty."
1.0,insane price,$20 for 12 taco shells? you can buy 20 tacos at taco bell for that price (including tax in most locales)
1.0,HOW MUCH!!??,"FIVE DOLLARS A BOTTLE? Thats insane, I don't spend that much for a drink at a nice restaurant! I can buy it in wally World for $1 on sale and $1.19 normal price!"
5.0,"Finally, an Organic Saltine","This is an excellent tasting product.  Hooray for Nabisco for putting out an organic saltine!  The cracker is very similar to regular Saltines, only perhaps even better tasting, and I am happy feeding this to my kids."
5.0,Best gluten-free pizza crust EVER,"The Udi's brand gluten-free pizza crust is the best that there is. Yes, of course, it's inferior to a gluten-based pizzeria-baked crust, but this is the equal of any supermarket-sold pre-baked pizza crust out there. And by that I mean it is the equal of any gluten-based supermarket-sold pre-baked pizza crust. It is far superior to any other gluten-free pizza crust out there, many of which taste like silly putty. This tastes just like a good pizza crust. And when you're on a gluten-free diet, a good pizza crust is as good as it gets."
5.0,Kitty Loves Greenies!,"Best deal on the net or from any pet chain!  My Maine Coon loves these and her teeth are pearly white from them too! Vet says they cause no weight gain and are good teeth cleaners. Can't go wrong when kitty loves them and they are GOOD for her!  Buy with confidence from Entirely pets, great people!"
1.0,Pass on this one,Too sweet with no chocolate taste.  Tried by various family members and did not appeal to any.  Would definately not recommend.
1.0,Where's the nipples?,"Bringing baby home from the hospital we thought we'd get a pack of these so we didn't have to make bottles right away.  The ""nipples not included"" is not obvious on the packaging.  The hospital had pre-sterilized nipples in packages.  I wrongly assumed it was the same as these.  What's the point???"
1.0,"THIN, WATERY, AND BITTER TASTE",DEFINITELY NOT AN IHOP PRODUCT -VERY WATERY AND BITTER TASTE.  EXPECT A BETTER QUALITY FROM AN IHOP PROMOTED PRODUCT.  BETTER QUALITY ON THE STANDARD FOOD MARKETS.
1.0,Original recipe was great - new one is awful,"Really simple - nestle changed the formula of Ovaltine to make it cheaper to produce, and the result is a powder that has 1/4 the vitamins and half the flavor. The marketing spin is that it is somehow healthier because it has less sugar, but that's only because you are putting half the amount in. Alternatives my kids like are carnation instant breakfast which still has all the vitamins and tastes great."
1.0,Strange chemical taste,"These candies arrived looking a bit as if they'd been thrown about, but the sell-by date was still okay. I ate one . . . and it had the nastiest chemical taste! I threw the rest of the box away. I don't know what's in these things, but mine were inedible."
5.0,Carnation Instant breakfast,This is a great product for picky eaters & it's sugar free. Both of my children love it & it's good for them.....
1.0,***DANGER***  DO NOT BUY!!!!,"THERE ARE WARNINGS ALL OVER THE NEWS AND INTERNET!!!  DO NOT FEED THESE TO YOUR DOG!!!!  THEY ARE MADE IN CHINA, AND CHICKEN JERKY MADE IN CHINA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS CASES OF KIDNEY FAILURE!  .....You don't have to take my word for it....Google it.  I purchased some from Costco, although my Aussie loved them, she started having urinary tract problems.  I immediately threw out the open bag and am returning the unopened bag.  I say a prayer every day, and hope she hasn't been hurt by this product.  PLEASE do NOT feed your pet anything that is made outside the USA!!  There are many great products made right here in the USA, yes they may cost a bit more, but Is your pet's health and life really worth saving a few $$$?????  DO NOT GIVE THESE TO YOUR DOG!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,This does not taste at all like Wild Bill's,"It tastes like Jack Links brand, not Wild Bill's.  Even the texture is totally different from Wild Bill's.  Not recommended!"
5.0,Yum!!,I love these peanuts. They are really easy to put into my child's lunch and for me to take to work as a snack. I love that they are packaged because then I won't eat the whole can.
1.0,"Not impressed at all, probably wrong picture","I expected the brown travel mug shown in the image, but instead I received a stainless steel mug with the lettering embossed on the side, no Gevalia logo. The lettering was also plain. I think the image placed on amazon.com is probably for the wrong item. Compare these for yourself at the gevalia website. The associate at amazon was very helpful though."
1.0,very disappointed,"The center was not liquid, but was more like a gel. There was a hole in the bottom of each candy where the liquid leaked out and was stuck to the crate! Chocolate didn't taste good either...outdated??"
5.0,Great catfood with good ingredients,"My kitty is not a picky cat to eat so generally I can't tell what he really likes. This one, of course my kitty loves it. For me, it doesn't gross me out with the smell. In fact, it smells like human food. Also, my kitty doesn't leave a bit on his dish when I pour this can. I check the ingredients whenever I buy something for my cat, and BFF generally offers pretty good ingredients with decent price. I highly recommend this cat food!"
1.0,Flavor is not good at all!,I like most of the Hint waters but this one taste really bad.  Like cucumber but with an after taste..like a urinal..I don't know how else to describe it.
1.0,no longer the best,These were once the best turkish pistachios! NO LONGER. My order this week was awful. Unsalted-even though the bag said salted. Tasted like boring unsalted California pistachios. Last time I order from Superior Nut.
1.0,yuck,"It was nasty,tasted like rubbing alcohol. I'm going to see if I can find something to mix it with if not i'll give it away."
1.0,basil and switch,I thought I was buying plum tomatoes-I recieved plum tomatoes with basil. I can't return it and I am dissappointed with this seller.
1.0,"Cheap yes, healthy maybe not","When I saw how much cheaper these were than Traverse Bay I decided to check them out. They appear to be the same as Craisins found in store which I find to be too sugary in both taste and touch. I like Traverse Bay as they taste to me to have the fruit, not just skin and juice. Eden is not bad but smaller size fruit.  [...]"
1.0,not very good,"I was not satisfied with these walnuts. The first time I ordered them, they were excellent. The second time I ordered them, they tasted very stale, almost burnt. Absolutely disgusting. Normally, if something is not up to par I will at least eat it to prevent wasting, but these were so bad that I threw them out and considered calling amazon for a return, although I never took the time to do that. I just made the decision never to order them again."
5.0,Lovely and comforting,"This is one of my favorite teas.  It's sweet enough that I don't need to add anything to it, it has that wonderful vanilla aroma and taste, plus it's caffeine-free and full of antioxidants on top of it all.  It's light and fresh, completely different from other herbal teas or the white, green and black teas most people usually drink.  Love it."
1.0,Was a Five Star Cereal - They Ruined Something Healthy,"I used to buy Special K Protein Plus all the time, but now that it ""tastes even better"" (read: now that they added sugar as one of the main ingredients), I won't be buying it anymore. More calories, more sugar, less fiber- but alas, now it is supposed to taste better. Maybe it does, but I won't be finding out."
1.0,NOT pure cane syrup,"This is not pure cane syrup.  This is simple syrup (water and sugar with preservatives) made from cane sugar, unlike Lyle's Pure Cane Syrup.  You can make Monin's product at home yourself by mixing equal part sugar and water over light heat (and skip the preservatives).  Calling this product Pure Cane Syrup is like calling sugar water with maple flavoring ""Pure Maple Syrup"".  If you are too lazy to make simple syrup then this product is for you.  At this price, this product is not worth it.  Do not be fooled (as I was)."
1.0,Tasteless Tea,"I am so sorry I purchased a 24-pack of this tea for my new Keurig. It is absolutely tasteless. Celestial Seasoning's Sleepytime Tea is far superior in every way. Before I switched to Keurig, I used STASH Camomile, and it was great. This one is tepid and tasteless. I am never going to order any Bigelow product for my Keurig. It's too expensive to waste. Right now I use the Sleepytime and put an ""Espresso"" shot of the Bigelow Camomile in to use up the 24-pack. If you love Camomile, don't buy this one."
1.0,It almost expire !,I place order on 29 May 12 . But this snack expire on 16 Aug 12. I also order about 200-300 bottle of Gerber Graduate! I got only 48 days to eat all of it include shipping day to eat 4 paxs of this.  How do i eat all of it within that time. Another product also almost expire.  Poor!!!!!! Why you do with your royal costumer like this. I pay you a lot every mounth!  Bad Bad Bad Bad !!!!!! If it almost expire just keep it away or send it to the bin. Don't give it to me. Waste of money!
1.0,Yuk!,"I hated this K-cup and couldn't wait to be done with the box.  (We hate wasting unless toxic.)  So while not toxic, the best I can say for this variety is that it tastes like bitter, yet weak ""sock water"".  Now, after reading the many good reviews this blend has received, I'm apprehensive to trust the reviews of the other K-cup varieties."
1.0,God awful smell when the dogs were chewing!,"I'm not sure what they put in these chews, but our family almost had to leave the room when our dogs were chewing. The dogs liked them, actually ate them probably too fast but wow, add some dog saliva and run for your life! Won't be getting these again. Alas, my dog still has lousy breath despite the claims of oral hygiene benefits."
5.0,Soup fit for a king," Bob's Red Mill Soup Mix, 13 Bean, 29-Ounce Units (Pack of 4) . A complete meal in itself. In these tough times here is a real delicious money saving and nutritious delight."
5.0,Tastes just like the store,I bought this at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf store to try to replicate the Iced White Chocolate Latte they make at the store. With my $60 espresso machine and this powder it is pretty close to what I usually pay $4.79 for a large. I think my limitations are the beans I'm using and the quality of my espresso machine but otherwise I am 90% there. I actually prefer the taste of Coffee Bean's White Chocolate powder over the Starbucks White Chocolate sauce. Starbucks White Chocolate sauce is way too sweet while Coffee Bean's White Chocolate has a more mellow taste. I'll be buying more on Amazon because I think it costs like $15 per can in the store.
5.0,Simply The Best,"These chocolates are much better than 5 stars!  We found a Leonidas' Shop during a visit to Brussels, Belgium earlier this year and brought home 4 of the ""kilo"" Assortment Ballotins.  I was ready to call directly to Brussels to place an order for more, but found them in New York City, so.........no need to search further.  The quality is outstanding and as other have already stated, far superior to other brands and MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE.  The shipment arrives overnight and each ballotin is protected in it's own styrofoam case.  Try an assortment (the dark is unbelievably decadent) and you will not be disappointed!  Enjoy"
5.0,Use milk instead of water -  tastes better,"I have low blood sugar, so I am always excited about trying a new product that is high in protein to keep my blood sugar levels stable.  I have been using Muscle Milk shakes for several years and have enjoyed good results, so I was very excited about trying Muscle Milk oatmeal.  I was soooooo disappointed by the awful taste.  Didn't want to waste the 6-pack, so I gave some to my Mother.  She said she loved the taste, but she used hot milk instead of hot water to mix.  Then I tried heating milk for 60 seconds in the microwave and then pouring it into the cup.  Wow!  What a difference.  The taste is so much better that I plan to add this product to my list of food staples.  Before I purchased, I read a few reviews that gave poor ratings due to the taste.  Try it with hot milk, and you might like it. Since I have low blood sugar, I need to eat a lot of protein which can increase cholesterol; this product only has 5mg of cholesterol per serving, so it is a great way to increase protein.  Also, I found the one cup serving to be a little too much.  So, I just eat 1/2 at breakfast and put the container in a gladware container and reheat the next day."
5.0,Tasty and Nutritious.,"We bought a four-pack of 10-ounce Milton's Multi-Grain Crackers for a Christmas party. Everyone who tried them liked them. However, we ended up with three of the four packs left over. Tough break! I love these things! I use them as a late night snack while watching TV. I add them to my noon lunch at work. I use them for improvised lunches when I don't feel like cooking anything. They're delicious. Very tasty. And I love the crunchy, somewhat gritty texture which goes along with the excellent flavor. Plus, they're mostly whole grain. What more could you ask?  Gary Peterson"
1.0,NOT PURE Cranberry Juice.,"This is not PURE Cranberry Juice.  It is sweetened with inexpensive APPLE JUICE.  I returned the three bottle and was promptly refunded my money, but I had to pay the $14 shipping cost.  I ended up going back to ordering from Dynamic Health.  Their 100% Pure Cranberry Juice Concentrate has NO additives.  It is not sweetened.  You can sweeten it with what ever you want and to your own liking. I wish that Nature Source was more honest about describing this product."
5.0,Surprisingly good,"Excellent low carb snack.  Great cheese flavor, good thing that they package in a 0.5oz snack pack because I'd go through these in no time and they're not cheap, but worth it."
5.0,Best Goat Cheese!,"There's a reason this cheese is so expensive - it is considered one of the best blue cheeses in the world.  I work in the restaurant industry, and it is widely known that Humboldt blue cheese is a delicacy.  It is very smooth, very creamy, doesn't have the tanginess that goat cheeses often have - I could eat this all day every day and be the happiest person in the world - and weigh about 800 pounds.  Buy some, you won't regret it!"
1.0,Unexpectedly flat taste (in a dented can),"Usually, organic food tastes sweeter and is more tender than food with preservatives and bug spray in them.  This lot of Westbrae organic corn I bought from Amazon tasted oddly flat:  very little flavor.  It may have had something to do with the cans having arrived dented, I don't know, or it was just a bad crop, or, who knows if it even was organic?  Disturbingly, the cans were lined with that white plastic that is so controversial.  Does the plastic contain endocrine disruptors that are in the news so much lately?  I don't know.  I probably wouldn't have even noticed if it hadn't been for the off-flavor.  I'm still open to buying organic canned produce, but I won't be ordering this one again."
1.0,Spoiled milk,"Just opened my box of 192 Mini-Moos today, the expiration date shows September, however the whole box is trash.  Leaking moo cups inside, stuck to the inside of the box.  The ones that are not leaking are curdled.  Nasty."
1.0,Lots of side effects,"Bought this for my wife. She tried half a bottle to start, still had trouble falling asleep and woke up in the middle of the night sweat with her heart racing and very uncomfortable. Product is NOT returnable. If you try this and you don't like it or have problems you are out of luck."
5.0,needed more,I had bought some of this locally and liked it so much that i had to lookk for a better price.  I have found the better price here on amazon.
5.0,"Kippered, Schmippered - they're tasty by Golly","I was introduced to eating Kippered Herring by a house guest from England. He ate them with eggs for breakfast. I tried eating this breakfast combo just out of curiosity - and now I am hooked (no pun intended). Believe me, I never thought eating fish for breakfast was very appealing before coming across these salty snacks. I still don't know what ""Kippered"" means, but I don't worry about it."
5.0,Greenies Dental Chews -Teenies,"Oh my gosh, we cannot be without Greenies at our house or I will have a very unhappy doggie.  She seems to know the exact time of day that she will get her greenie, and just wags and begs for it right after dinner.  I order from Amazon because the price is the best I have found and the delivery is fast and convenient. I am a huge fan of Amazon, they treat their customers right and makes all purchases/returns very easy."
5.0,Best tea.  Ever.,"I first had this at McMenamin's Kennedy School in Portland, Oregon at breakfast.  I fell in love with this tea instantly.  It's not heavily floral at all.  It has enough rose flavor that it keeps you coming back for more.  I can't find it in our stores in central Ohio, so I'm thrilled I can find this online.  Enjoy!"
5.0,If You LOVE Velveeta Cheese...,"I was raised up in a family with no other cheese than Velveeta! I'm 63 years 'young' now...and have been enjoying this for years. When I found it in here, and free shipping!...I immediately bought it, and have been a repeat customer. If you love Velveeta Cheese, then this is something you're going to love! It's so much better than the powdered mixes that you need to add butter and milk to. This has the thick, creamy mixture right in a sealed foil pouch. You cook the sheels, drain, and then stir in the pouch of cheese. Nothing could be simpler! I actually don't drain off all the water, because the cheese sauce is so nice and thick ;-) I'm on here today to buy another 12 boxes. A wonderful product for those of you that love Velveeta cheese!"
5.0,Yum!,"These crackers are tasty, a little sweet but not obnoxiously so.  They're about as sweet as standard US white bread.  They have a very neutral quality which makes them a good accompaniment to almost anything, not just wine as the packaging suggests."
5.0,Great treat/training food,"We slice the log, then cut into smaller pieces to be used for training rewards, filling Kongs or special treats once in a while.  Our dogs love all of the flavors."
1.0,Baby food product made in Mainland China? No thanks.,"If I had known this baby food product was made in Mainland China, I would not have ordered it. We refuse to give our baby this product due to the negative publicity plastered all over the news associated with tainted infant formula and other food products made in Mainland China. I own other items made in China but food products are something that I refuse to consume.  I went back and re-read the description on the Amazon.com website and did not see a product origin. Isn't there a disclosure requirement for retailers to disclose from where products they sell are made? (silly me!)  We both ate packs of the rice crackers while I did whatever research I could on the factory in Guangzhou, China that made this rice cracker. Not much came out of my simple desktop research - 1) a letter from the FDA regarding claims on the box: [...]; 2) import refusal letter from FDA: [...]  Funny thing, the rice crackers actually taste good. And, I am still around to write this review. However, in my kitchen, I have six boxes of Baby crackers that I will probably not eat.  In the mean time, I will search for and purchase a baby teething cracker made some where other than Mainland China. Maybe I'll walk to a local Wholefoods rather than buy baby products from Amazon.com."
5.0,Delicious organic lollipops!,"We're always trying to find healthier alternatives for our kids, ages 3 and 19 months.  When I saw that Amazon was running a special on them, I decided to snag several bags & am glad I did!  WOW!  These are excellent.  The flavors are incredible and both kids are sold on them as am I.  None of that crap that you find in most suckers ... high fructose corn syrup, all of the dyes and colorings.  Just all natural ingredients with an incredible flavor!  As another reviewer stated, there is no rhyme or reason as to how many you get of each flavor, but that's okay by me.  I would have to say one of my favorites is the mango tango.  Yum!  My son has taste tested all of them and there isn't one that he doesn't like.  :-)  And he's a picky kid!  Try them while they are offering free shipping & 45% off the 2nd bag.  It's like getting 2 bags for one and you can put them back for their b-day party grab bags, send some to preschool for party day and pack some in your purse for a quick treat to give the kids while out & about.  Enjoy!  Mmmmmm!"
1.0,Packed in the wrong oil.,"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best."
5.0,My little Pom loves it,"Small dogs are prone to weight issues.  My little pomeranian was overweight, and I had to do something.  I purchased this bag of food, and fed her according to my vets recommendation.  My pom has lost the weight, and loves the food.  For a small dog, this bag will last a long time."
1.0,should have a expiration date,"That was some hard old taffy..I wanted newer taffy thats chewing, not crunchy. I am still gonna eat it but not real pleased."
1.0,Rotten when I received,"I ordered this second time. First time it came perfect. However this time, the package was smelling and rotten. There is no policy at amazon to return the food items. I wrote to returns department and got nothing! Dont order items you cant return to Amazon specially food or perishable items."
1.0,bad news,"a worse-than-poor substitute for the overpriced similar General Foods product that Amazon abruptly stopped carrying (so has Shoprite, but -- persistence! -- Target still carries it. )"
5.0,Very good brand of macaroni.,"This is the first time ordering Anna's pasta products.  It's made in Italy.  It's pure Semolina.  This shape is wonderful.  It's close to a pappardelle, not quite as wide, with wavy edges, a lot less money, too.  I love the shape.  It's substantial with a meaty Bolognase.  It does make it fun to eat as you use your fork to try to get the long, wide noodle into your mouth...it's not slurp-able.  I used the Fasta Pasta maker, cooked for about 14 minutes on high.  This is a one pound package so I used half for just a few of us. We all really liked this shape and this brand.  I will order this shape again."
1.0,BAD PACKAGING,"I dont even know if the product taste any good but I need to give only 1 star for them. I opened the box,they were packed very poorly, 2 of the 3 can which were made of cardboard papers broke in half which created flour all over the box. The only good can was all covered and got pretty dirty, too much work . I am very disappointed and I need to say I never gave 1 star to anything , and this product deserves it.I actually want to return them."
5.0,Chinese Curry Powder,This curry powder may not be available in grocery stores now.  At least I haven't found it yet.  I used to use S & B all the time.  It makes a great curry flavor for chicken or shrimp.
5.0,Unflavored Gelatin in bulk,"Works perfectly, just like the little Knox gelatin packs (only less expensive) for nails and to add protein to diet."
5.0,A different but nice flavor of tea,"Tetley Cardamom Tea is a great tasting tea with a hint of cardamom flavor.  Elaichi or Cardamom flavor is a new addition (introduced in India in 2005)  to Tetley's line of flavored teas and is perhaps the first bagged version of Cardamom Tea from a well known Tea company.  There are other brands of tea like ""Tea India"" available in US with  their own Cardamon flavored tea, but so far I have found Tetley's cardamom tea to be the best tasting one.  Amazon.com price of $17.91 for a pack of three 72 count boxes (as of July, 2009) is just right and is cheaper than the price in most Indian grocery stores in Texas and Oklahoma."
1.0,Just awful,"I bought a bag of these to give to my kids at Easter, but when I tasted them I had to go out and buy some Jelly Belly's. Literally every flavor was just awful, I mean awful. Each one I tried was stranger and more disgusting tasting than the last. I have no idea what flavor any of them were supposed to be. This is not a joke review, they were really that bad. I threw the entire bag in the garbage. Avoid these things at all cost."
1.0,the worst espresso beans I've ever had,"as soon as I opened the bag, I immediately  knew the beans were already oxidized and there was a pretty strong sour smell in a bad way and  beans were  ridiculously oily like other reviewer said but I still tried pulling some espresso shots, but it tasted nothing but bitter with no flavors and then I had to clean up my rancilio rocky grinder thoroughly after that...yuck! I trusted reviews this time..but I wasn't lucky...I would never buy this product again"
1.0,Just as bad as moxie,"I tried some of this after my gf made me some. My god, taste ok for 2secs then the after taste hits you, kinda like moxies after taste hits you.  Couldn't even finish 1/4 of a packet, hope I don't vomit later. O.0"
1.0,HORRIBLE!,"I have a one-word summary for Terro Ant Killer Dust:  Horrible.  But to be more specific, Dust is horrible because it looks like your basic carpet freshener (and is spread from the can in the same manner)except that the ugly white ""dust"" NEVER GOES AWAY!  I guess I just assumed that this crap would dissolve but it just doesn't.  It just sits on top of your window sills and around your doors as an ugly white powder.  The wind blew some of the dust from around my front door onto my door mat, which then ruined my doormat.  I don't care if this crap works or not if it creates more problems than it solves!"
5.0,Terrific and healthy nutrition,"Besides being just plain tasty, a small addition of Nutiva coconut oil to my daily diet lowered my triglycerides and ""bad"" cholesterol. It also ended nightly coughing from what my doctor diagnosed as gastric reflux. Better coconut oil than prescription proton inhibitors that leach calcium from your bones!"
5.0,So flavorful it can easily be stretched to flavor more meat,"Normally, when I review a product, I'm careful to use it as specified. This time, I made an exception. The reason is because I love curries, especially Indonesian curries, but I'm currently following a low-carbohydrate regimen, and most premade curries are a little too carb-heavy -- including this one. It's got a fair amount of sugar in the ingredients, so the whole box contains 75 grams of carbs, which is a lot for 28 oz of meat, the amount of meat specified on the box.  But I just *had* to try this curry. So my solution was to make a lot more meat, thus stretching the sauce so each serving had less sauce.  This one box flavored 4-1/4 pounds of stew meat and 2-1/4 pounds of lamb. That's about three times the serving suggested on the box. You'd think the result might be thin flavors, but I have to say each bite was delicious and highly flavored. Absolutely restaurant-quality, as others have said. And I love the bits of pandan leaf that populate the sauce. It's just a great, pleasurable, satisfying meal.  I did notice that the coconut doesn't break up easily, but if you wait until the mixture is just about boiling, it breaks up eventually. I wish I had used coconut milk instead of water, and sauteed the meat in coconut oil, as another reviewer has cleverly suggested -- I think those options should be mentioned on the box.  What I did do was fry the stew meat in batches in a large frying pan. When all the meat was fried till nearly done. I put it back in the pan and poured in the curry mixture, which deglazed the pan, and cooked the whole thing for another 15 minutes or so. For the lamb, I did something different; after sauteeing the lamb, I put it in a pressure cooker with about 2/3 cup of the sauce and cooked it for 12 minutes. Unbelievable flavor and tenderness. I think I'm going to use the sautee-till-brown/pressure-cook-with-sauce method every time I make this kind of curry from now on.  I really highly recommend this kit to anyone who doesn't mind a little sugar in their curry (and I admit it wouldn't have that ""restaurant flavor"" without the sugar). Now that I know one box can flavor 6 pounds of meat, easy, I regard this is both an economical purchase and a relatively low-carb treat."
1.0,"Not really ""white chocolate"" at all","This product was disappointing.  It's basically regular cocoa mix with a large amount of coffee creamer added (in such that it becomes the primary ingredient).  There is no cocoa BUTTER in it, which is the element that makes ""white chocolate"" what it is.  Very deceptive and not like white chocolate mix.  If you like milk chocolate cocoa with lots of coffee creamer, you'll probably like this product.  :("
5.0,Tangle your tongue,"Marmite doesn't hold a huge section of shelving at the local supermarket.  It's definitely a niche item in the states.  Our Brit friends, though, speak highly of it, so I had to try.  Good stuff!  If you want a departure from the morning toast with butter and jam, skip the butter and jam and smear on some Marmite!  Your coffee will taste brighter!  This stuff it definitely a different way to hammer on your taste buds in a vigorous fassion!"
1.0,Poorly made and bad quality control,"The two problems other users have complained about are the same ones I experienced, which shows that this product is badly made and should be recalled. Two weeks into using this product the base of the plastic cup where the drive shaft is inserted broke into pieces. I returned the product and they sent me a new one. The new one had the other problems, it would steam but when it was time for it to blend, it'd just make a really loud noise and the blades would not move at all. The drive shaft is so tight that I find it impossible to take out of the cup and was afraid to force it in case it broke again. I would NOT RECOMMEND this product at all. It's very poorly made and I wish I had read the bad reviews before I got it."
5.0,Love this pan,"I love brownies but hardly ever made them because cutting them into nice 2"" squares was near impossible.  No matter how many times I soaked  the knife in ice water after each cut I always had the same result, a lot of the brownie stuck to the knife.  With this pan my brownies always come out looking like those they sell at a bakery.  The only drawbacks are 1.  You do have to grease the entire pan between every square or they will stick to the pan.  I spray Baker's Joy baking spray between all the squares,  And 2. ... Cleanup is also not fun as you have to wipe between every square with your sponge and soap.  I make brownies many times a year to share with my coworkers and I'm proud to bring them in looking so nice and perfectly square. This pan is a definite keeper."
1.0,Chemical Taste,I would never describe these as berry burst. They are sickenly sweet (and I have a huge sweet tooth) with a weird chemical-like after taste. These sat around the house for a month until we finally threw them out.
1.0,Wheat thins,"I use to love these things, tasted so great and went great with any kind of dip.  I just ate some the other day and they tasted terrible.  They had a horrible aftertaste and tasted artificial to begin with.  What has happened to these crackers?  Is it just that my tastes have changed or has the product gotten crappy?  I just know that I am not going to purchase these crackers again, yuck!!!"
5.0,So good I wanted to write a review,"I bought these after finding them in the health food section. SOOO tasty and unbelievably flavorful... I've been buying them plenty of times.  Pros: Delicious!!!  Cons: The instructions are wrong on the cup, and correct on the outer paper. My fianc&eacute; burnt his by cooking the extra minute which is how we discovered this error.  Cooking in the microwave for 1.5 minutes after stirring, and 4 more minutes makes it perfect! So good - I'm eating one right now!"
1.0,"Never recieved it, company ignoring my emails","This item was a part of an order that had two other items, each from different sender. I received the first two within a few days, this one never showed up. When it was already a few days late I had an order number so I checked where it was to see why I haven't still gotten it. It was delivered. To San Diego, California. I live in SLC Utah! OK. Just a mistake, no problem. I emailed the company and they gave the shipping number to check where it is because they sent it. First of all, they gave me a wrong number, luckily I had mine saved from when I made the order. When I copy pasted the delivery to Sand Diego info and asked them what is up with that, I never got the reply back. I tried again a few days later asking do they intend to resend this item or will they give me a refung....still no replay. This is not a lot of money, but it pisses me of that I ordered something through Amazon and the company is doing this. I will most definitely never order anything from them again, and today I am contacting Amazon to see what they can do about it. it isn't the money, it's the principal!"
5.0,Great Deal,"I have so many dogs that I have to have ALOT of treats and this was a great deal for 6 boxes. We got the Blue Dog Bakery Natural Soft Dog Treats, Peanut Butter Flavor Softies, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) each box is big enough for each dog (we have 20 right now)to get a couple treats at bedtime which is perfect. Will order again for sure!"
5.0,Amazon Green Mountain Pumpking Spice Keurig K cups,Soooo delicious it is hard to have just one cup ~~ the taste is superb and yes I would certainly recommend this to a friend
1.0,WORST MIX EVER,"Took a bottle along on a camping trip, looking forward to a drink with dinner after being out on a trail all day. YUK. Its generic. The best Bloody Mary mix I have ever had out of bottle came from a Bass Pro Shop in Indiana."
1.0,Love the Product! HATE the Price!,"I purchased a box of these from my local grocery store for about $4.50 ... which I thought was a bit pricy so I came home and looked on Amazon to see if anyone was selling them cheaper.  Imagine my glee when I saw this price ... 24 for $49.99.  24 boxes for $49.99 comes to about $2.08 each .... except there was a problem.  I didn't get 24 boxes.  I got 4 boxes w/ 6 cookie bars which equals 24.  If you do the math, that comes to $12.50 per box. Girl Scout cookies don't cost that much! (YET ANYWAY!) I quickly called Amazon, I was told this was the price.  I told them I wanted to return them and get a full refund.  No problem, we'll do you one better: keep the cookies and we'll refund you the full price.  I LOVE Amazon.  But, someone definitely dropped the ball on this one.  To charge $12.50 for a box of 6 cookie bars is highway robbery.  BEWARE Amazon Customers!"
1.0,"Never Arrived, Couldnt Get In Touch",I ordered a bonsai tree three weeks before Christmas so it would arrive for my husband before we left to go out of town. Lou told me I would be receiving a tracking number the day I ordered it. I did not receive the tracking number so I called back every day for a week and left one message but was unable to leave anymore because his mailbox was full. The tree did not come and when I called to ask for a refund (after two weeks of calling someone picked up the day before Christmas) they said they would but then they did not refund me the full amount. They were apologetic but trying to get in touch with them and was a NIGHTMARE and i had no gift for my husband on Christmas. VERY UNRELIABLE
1.0,My finicky cat will barely eat this,"Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat. She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day. So, I ordered a bag of this and she hardly touches it. If I offer it her in the morning and then fresh servings at lunch and dinner, she barely nibbles at it and sits by her bowl and mews.  Usually it's not until close to dinner time when she;ll actually start nibbling on this. I was very disappointed because I really liked the health benefits for he but if she won't eat it then that really dos her no goof.  I will have to try the wilderness variety next."
5.0,very good tasting,"i have not had other panda flavors, but i do really like the blueberry licorice.  good ingredients such as molasses, wheat flour, blueberry puree to name a few.  like a good licorice, it's soft and chewy.  there's roughly about 40 pieces in a 6 oz bag.  although i usually don't like black licorice because of it's strong taste, the licorice flavor here is more subtle.  i highly enjoy and recommend this licorice treat for a quick snack.  it's good!"
5.0,Love primal strips!,"These are absolutely the best snacks around!  Easy to carry, low-calorie, delicious, full of protein.  I go through them so fast it's unbelievable, and they're vegan!"
1.0,Not so much.....,"I like strong flavored coffee, and only occasionally roast coffees.  I brew in the little Bodum 17 oz (makes 250 cc) French Press using boiling water and a 4-minute cycle time. I use about 5 level scoops of fresh ground coffee per batch.   I found this brew to be weak on flavor, and very often bitter. With a halved cycle time, the bitterness doesn't disappear.   I love the smell of fresh coffee brewing in any time of day. I seldom find any aroma during brewing or tasting this coffee, and only occasionally when the beans were ground.   One more observation - the ground beans hold considerable amounts of air. When wet with boiling water, most of the air is liberated - producing a three-phase foam: air, liquid, and solid ground coffee. If allowed to stand, half of the contents of the filled French Press container will be this foam. Slowly it will lose air and evaporated water, becoming a solid matrix! So I continually stir the contents of the container for at least half of the brew time until nearly all the air has been liberated and the foam has been ""beaten down."" Then I can add the other half of the water - filling the container. The result appears as does Guinness Stout - dark liquor with a little aerated foam on top. OK!. Without the stirring, the water-soluble oils in nearly all the ground beans are extracted into maybe half of the liquid - not the uniform and consistent brewing environment I was hoping to obtain. THEN, when the brew cycle is complete, I find that the grounds are so swollen with liquid that they don't easily liberate brewed coffee liquor as the filter element is depressed. You have to force the thing downward and hot coffee spouts from the top of the French Press container. Odd..... as I don't find this in any other bean coffee product.   Just to check my senses, I bought a  pound of hazelnut from my local supermarket. It has both taste and aroma, but isn't cheap...."
1.0,Order from E-Pets Galore,"Shortly after I wrote my first review I received a phone call from D.J. at E-Pets Galore.  We had, what I thought, was a very pleasant conversation.  She apologized that I did not receive the correct items I had ordered.  D.J. told me that I would receive the items I had originally ordered at the latest by the end of the following week after our conversation.  She explained to me that it would not be worth it to send back the items I received in error.  I told her I would donate them to a local Animal Rescue compliments of E-Pets Galore.  Which I did.  I was very happy that D.J. had taken the time to contact me.  Our conversation had gone so well that I had decided I would do business with E Pets Galore in the future. I trusted her words.  I told D.J. that I would edit my orignal review at amazon once I received the correct items.  It is now 2 1/2 weeks later and I still have not received the items that I had originally ordered and that D.J said I would receive by at the latest the end of last week, April 3, 2009.  I have left two messages for her and have not received a return call.  Since I have already donated the 25 items to a local Animal Rescue, based on trusting and believing what D.J. said, I have financially lost $91.49.  The one positive from this awful experience with E-Pets Galore, is that some Animals in need will have some treats that otherwise they would not have had.  I am very sad that this experience has turned out this way, Fran B."
1.0,gummy pasta,Very gummy pasta.  Now I am stuck with a whole case. What a waste of money.  Nothing like trader joes pasta.
1.0,Grease!,"Let's start by looking at the list of ingredients: Petrolatum (petroleum jelly), mineral oil, paraffin, lanolin wax, fragrance... So, there's more perfume in here than any magical ""nourishment"" ingredient, and far more grease than anything else. Even the nourishment ingredients are nearly all oils.  This stuff would be great if you want to spike up your hair. Myself, I hate greasy hair and that's what you get when you use it. It is also nearly impossible to wash out, even using Clear's own shampoos.  No sir, I don't like it."
5.0,"Delicious, Nutritious","Very tasty and a nice balance of protein, calories, and sugar.  Most of the Clif brands now have way too much sugar for my taste or diet. Earnest hits it right on the spot."
1.0,Sugar! Nothing more! Not tea whatsoever!,"Ingredient list: Sugar, Acidity Regulator (including miscellaneous chemicals). No tea whatsoever. $22 for 18 oz. (500g) of sugar with apple flavor. Most expensive sugar in the market!! Health benefit? None! It comes in a square tin with plastic bag inside containing granulated sugar. That's all. Nothing more."
1.0,My cat hates it now.,"This used to be my cat's favorite treat (it wasn't daily fare).  It used to have a great texture.  Now it is dry and unpalatable.  I agree with Mars' review here. I thought it was maybe just a bad batch but over time it has proven to be either a new formulation or maybe just a less fatty part of the tuna being used.  It is also clear that Natural Value is fraudulently claiming  AAFCO compliance in their formulation.  Under pressure from  misguided pet owners and Internet cranks this manufacturer removed menadione from their fish based formulations. AFFCO requires the use of vitamin K3 (menadione) in any cat food product containing greater than 25% fish on a dry matter basis, and for good reason. I have labels from previous and new cans and the new ones clearly do not list the required vitamin K supplementation.  So, Natural Value is either lying about the actual ingredients or about the AAFCO label statement.  In either case, I can't trust this company anymore.  I used to buy their cat food by the case at Whole Foods.  If your cat happens to like this product, I think it would be OK only as a treat (since it does have a great basic ingredients list), definitely not as a regular entire meal. Even if this were a trustworthy product, it is probably best to limit exposure for cats to apex predators (that accumulate toxins) like tuna anyway."
1.0,Not Kosher,"On the Amazon page where these items, the Corn Husks and Masa Harina,  are shown it is stated that they are Kosher. When these items arrived they didn't have the Kosher symbol on the package. I contacted the Kosher agency that supervises this name brand, they informed me that for products from this company to be Kosher, they MUST have the Hechsher, the kosher symbol, of this agency. Because of this I was unable to use these products."
1.0,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!,"As other reviewers said about the Red Velvet version of this product, let me be the first to say I wish i read the reviews BEFORE ordering this. I had never even been to Griddle Cafe when i was in LA--which is the reason for me buying this product; and i must say to those who are curious: SAVE YOUR MONEY!! You are better off going to your local grocery store and buying some Bisquick or Aunt Jemima pancake mixes for all of just $4, instead of the whopping $14 product. Oh and the extra for shipping & handling.  This mix, whether with water or milk is just god-awful. My pancakes turned out to be tasteless, bitter, dry and the aftertaste is just horrible. I thought I was going to get something on the level of IHOP since a restaurant was going to sell their mix, but what I got pales in comparison. Excuse me, not to be compared.  Again, read before ordering. Trust me when I say this. I had to trash this in the garbage."
1.0,Really bad...unless you like drinking perfume or cologne....,"I ordered this product last year and it was very good. This year when I received, it tasted different in a BAD way. Da Vinci must have changed their recipe since last year. Now it has an artificial after taste...like when you spray perfume or cologne and it gets in your mouth. Has a perfume taste and even a perfume like smell. Revised recipe must contain too much of the aromatic spices and/or artificial spices. To Marketing and Research people at Da Vinci....If it ain't broken, don't fix it....a lesson Starbucks needs to learn. I will NEVER buy this product again. I have more than 3/4 of a container left which will be thrown out....."
1.0,Not for dogs who chew their food,"My veterinarian recommended these because I was having a hard time getting my 17-year old beagle to take her pain medication. I had tried all the usual ways (sticking the pill into cheese or dog treats, putting it on the back of her tongue and holding her mouth shut, etc.), so I was willing to try anything.  There's nothing unusual about these treats that makes a dog eat them any differently than anything else. So, I stick the pill in, my dog starts chewing the pill pocket, and soon she's foaming at the mouth because she bit into the pill.  If your dog wolfs down food without chewing, this product will work, but is probably unnecessary. If your dog chews food, it just won't work."
5.0,Good value,My husband uses this in his coffee and we go through quite a bit of it.  This 400-count package is a very good value for the money.
5.0,Drew the Elvis fan for XMas,"It's one of the few Elvis itmes I know she doesn't have, would be overpriced if she were going to eat them."
1.0,Horrible looking guac dip. Horrible tasting guac dip.,"Title says it all folks, this is the worst guacamole mix I have ever run across. Waste of otherwise fantastic ripe avocados. Basically, each dip tastes like a 1000 rancid tacos from Taco Bell.  Does not deserve one star. I really wonder what the taste engineers at Casa Fiesta were smoking when they created this mix."
5.0,LOVE IT!,I LOVE this flavor of Crystal Lite and have no clue why on earth they have discontinued it.  I am doing my best to get all I can find. This is truly the only one of their flavors that I like.  My 3 year old granddaughter loves it too.  Will be SO SAD when we can no longer find it.
5.0,Better tasting,"I used this as white, so I dont know how it takes to color, but it is far easier to use then other fondants, and it tastes WAY better. I would purchase it again."
1.0,"it is blended low quality, it is not barooti ahmad tea at all","I have been drinking tea for at least 30 years. I never use tea bags and always make tea using traditional method. I know all different kinds of tea like barooti, etc better than everyone else. I received the package in time but the quality is really bad. I am 100% sure than this is not barooti. Do not buy this kind of tea if you really want good quality. I had to blend it with other kinds but it did not help at all. You can easily see that it is rubbish."
5.0,Holey smokes,"Let me just tell you what a great decision 5 hour energy drink made at the corporate level.  As soon as I received my first case I popped open the first bottle and chugged it down. Then I relized they are like pringals, once you pop you can't stop!! I had to contain my self to drink only one every hour.  By the twelfth hour/bottle, I had walked from my house to the UPS facility to grab the second shipment (this one arrived exactly one week later). However, my legs hurt from standing for so long. I am very happy. Thank you corporate at 5 hour energy!"
1.0,"Too dry,not snack quality","Sorry to have to write a negative review, but these are terrible.  Much too dry, almost tastes like little rolled up pieces of paper. I tried mixing them in my yogurt, but they were still much too dry.  Don't waste your money on these.  Buy Heaven Mountain brand, as they are the absolute best! You won't believe the diffence, until you try them."
1.0,yuck,"Maybe some people will enjoy these but I could not eat any of it.  The texture is slimy and it looks like worms.  Even the spices are not appealing to me.  Oh well, I enjoy Costco's gf pasta."
1.0,Stay Away!!!,"This is one of the WORST k-cup coffee varieties I have tried. I have been enjoying Tully's Italian Roast, but something is messsed up with the pricing on Amazon (like: it is twice the price I paid for it last time!) So, I figured I would try the Timothy's instead. What a mistake!!!  It is bitter, weak and truly disgusting. I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this one."
1.0,"For us, not worth the money","I was excited to receive our Miracle Noodle as both my husband and I are limiting carbohydrates.  When I opened the first bag (noodles ship in some kind of liquid), the odor was very off-putting but I washed, blanched and dried the noodles as instructed on the package and proceeded to prepare one of our favorites, Singapore Noodles.  I figured that even if the flavor was not the same as rice noodles that the strong curry, shrimp, onion, garlic and ginger flavors would help disguise it.  We found that NOT to be the case.  The noodles do not absorb the other flavors as rice noodles do and the mouth feel was not tough and spongy.  Neither of us liked for the noodles.  Especially at the high cost."
5.0,Proflowers made good on their offer of restitution,ProFlowers offered to send a replacement bouquet to make amends for a mistake on my first order.  I took them up on their offer and they came through with flying colors.  I will give them my business again.
5.0,Worth the price for people with weak digestion,"Every type of rice cooks perfectly in my rice cooker, which makes reviewing taste irrelevant. I choose sprouted brown rice because it's easier to digest. People with weak digestion, Crohn's disease or colitis who  have to stick with white rice only, can tolerate this one, and it adds more nutrition values to their food."
1.0,Unuseable,"The flour in the shipment I received smelled like mildew. Since I was trying Amaranth flour for the first time I wasn't sure if the strong odor was normal. I tried baking a loaf of bread with the flour. Even after baking, the strong odor was still present - the bread smelled and tasted like mildew. I had to throw both the flour and the bread away..."
1.0,Buyer Beware!,"I was in a hurry and looking to re-order the gallon bottle of O'Dells which was out of stock. I noticed this, which appears to be the same as O'Dells and didn't read closely that it was 16 ounces not 128 ounces due to the price being relatively close. Was shocked when it got here to discover it was only 16 ounces. Price comparison...O'Dells 128 ounces $17.99 (.14 per ounce) Paragon 16 ounce $12.63 (.78 per ounce). Run away from this item quickly. If O'Dells is unavailable, get the Wabash Valley Farms instead!"
1.0,"""Seedless"" Claim Is Inaccurate","I purchased two packages of this product, but have only opened one of them. Not only did this package contain seeds, but the seeds have been sliced and broken up into small sharp pieces that may harm one's esophagus and/or intestinal tract if swallowed. The only way to eat the tamarind is to hold a small amount in your mouth without swallowing, and allow your saliva to loosen the tamarind while your tongue locates the pieces of seeds so you can remove them with your fingers. Only when you're sure all pieces of seed have been removed should you begin chewing the tamarind. I gave this product a ""1"" rating but only because I wasn't allowed to give it a ""0""."
5.0,"If you like whole olives, I recommend these.","These olives are a blend of Kalamata, Ionian Green and other types.  The quality is fine and they taste great.  The blend is typical of those found in olive bars in supermarkets like Wegmans in the NE but at about 2/3rds the cost. If you are looking for mixed whole Greek olives and can use 5 lbs within 1 months time from opening,this is the best deal you are likely to find."
5.0,Caramel Tootsie Pops,Got this for my sister.  She said there were delicious even though she preferred Chocolate.  Have ordered a couple of her.
5.0,"CRISPY, CRUNCHY, AND CHOCOLATEY","Who doesn't love Oreo cookies?  Many of us well remember after school snacks of Oreo cookies and milk.  However, also for many of us those school days when we could eat all we wished and not gain an ounce are in the past.  So, it's a special treat that brings back all kinds of good memories to find Oreo Thin Crisps.   No, I was not one who pulled the cookie apart to lap the frosting, I just loved the chocolatey taste and that is all in these cookies less the unwanted cals. They're crispy, crunchy, chocolate wafers - a wonderful comfort snack.   A high five for Oreo Thin Crisps!    - Gail Cooke"
5.0,"Yummy, same as always!","We fell in love with this great spicy tea (pumpkin-pie type spices) when we first tried it on a whim. It's delicious both hot and iced. When our local Trader Joe's stopped carrying it a couple years ago, I was happy to find amazon carries it."
5.0,Classic Hazlenut,This is one of my very favorite and most often go-to K-cup. The price is usually decent on Amazon but I've found it cheaper at Kohl's.
1.0,FDA Warns Chicken Jerky From China May Harm or Kill Your Dog.,"STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search ""chicken jerky treats china"" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am ""fortunate""... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal of 2007 that killed 1000's of our four legged friends...TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY.  I read that Dogswell was going to stop manufacturing in China tho dont know current status."
5.0,Helps with sore joints and muscles,"I am a long-distance runner and a belly dancer.  My back objects to the dancing and my knees object to the running.  I was having a lot of trouble managing my pain and still doing my activities with ibuprofen alone.  I read about tart cherry juice in my running magazine, and I decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews here on Amazon.  I am simply blown away by the difference!  My body really reacts to this stuff.  My knee pain has disappeared, and my back only hurts during really deep back bends.  I had same-day relief, too.  I can definitely tell the difference on days where I forget to take this!  As an added bonus, I have noted a marked decrease in how sore my muscles are, as well.  I wish I had heard about this sooner!  I follow what it says on the bottle, 1 once twice daily.  At first, I was just using a tablespoon and licking it out of the tablespoon (2TBS=1 oz.), which I still do in the mornings, but good lord this stuff is tart!  The first one isn't too bad, I think mostly because your taste buds are in shock.  The second one really gets me, though!  Lately, I've been mixing my ounce into a cup of orange juice at dinner, which looks disgusting but tastes, surprisingly, really good.  I really hope this product comes back in stock soon, I don't think I could go without it and I'm hesitant to switch to a different brand."
1.0,Terrible Product,"I will leave the ""tea dust"" discussion to the other reviews. My concern is the overbearing chemical taste that this product has. I drink a large amount if English breakfast tea and have never tasted anything this bad."
5.0,Love love love this drink!!,"I love Click! I don't know what I'd do without it. I drink one every morning on my way to work, using a Blender Bottle. It has as much caffeine as two coffee drinks with 15 grams of protein. It tastes like iced coffee straight from the coffee shop. I love this stuff!"
5.0,Walden Farms Mayo,"I was skeptical about the Walden Farms products. No Sugar, No Carbs, No Fat?? I couldn't have imagined any good taste from from all the ""No's"" listed.  After using several of their products I have to admit they are well worth the price without sacrificing the taste. I really enjoy the mayo on a lettuce wrap for a snack or lunch. Wow! It's healthy for you."
5.0,"Tastes great, not sure how much it works","I am a very active person and I got this tea because it was hyped up to be a muscle recovery tea and is loaded with antioxidants.  While I haven't been drinking it consistently enough to see if it has helped my recovery periods I do know that it tastes great and has a lot of green tea in it.  They are still finding benefits to drinking green tea so I figure it can't hurt.  The taste is great, it's green tea, with a very subtle lemon taste.  I enjoy it a lot and would reccommend to anyone considering buying it."
1.0,Was Not Impressed,"This cheese is best described as solidified sour cream with a faint hint of blu.  I tried to like it and feel around for the flavor, but the sour cream taste overpowers whatever the unique flavor of the mold might have.  After separating the vein alone and trying that it tastes musty but not in a good way to me.  Those that say this is the best cheese they tried should give gorgonzola a shot for the title."
5.0,One Of The Better Flavors,"If you've never used these mixes before, they're easy enough even for a lazy oldtimer who doesn't like to spend time in the kitchen.  I'll sit in front of the TV and spend two minutes whisking it up on the coffee table, right in the measuring cup itself, which makes it easy to pour into a bowl or bowls.  I usually fix two packages at a time, so use my four-cup Pyrex, available on Amazon (geesh, that sounded like a commercial).  The result is... well, much more than worth that two minutes.  Flavor is a matter of taste; but, for me, this pistachio is one of their better flavors.  You won't find big chunks of nut floating around; but there are enough little granules to remind you that this is pistachio.  Unless you don't feel like a nut, I'll recommend this flavor and this easy dessert."
5.0,Great Coffee,I really like a good strong cup of coffee in the mornings.  I have finally found it.  Great robust flavor.
1.0,Amazing?! More like worst GF bread ever!,"After reading raving reviews ordered this thru subscribe and save, boy, i was wrong! Followed directions very carefully, (basic white mode in bread maker) it didn't rise, came out very hard and dense like a brick and burnt. Didn't care for the taste, smells weird too. Second time used KA mixer, again, followed directions, baked in the oven, (according to directions: bake for 70 minutes, 350F) , bread was already dark in 40 minutes, after 30 more minutes it would be burnt for sure. Didn't rise, again,  like a brick hard and dense. I used the same yeast to make regular French bread just to check if yeast was fresh enough. Wheat flour bread baked beautifully and was very delicious. I just don't understand all the positive reviews out there, nothing is amazing, it's the worst bread mix ever and I can't even return unopened packages :( I want to try other brand bread mixes."
5.0,perfect for the office and school,"these are great little coffee packets.  I have one box at home for those days where I do not want to make a full pot of coffee, and one at school for those days when I need another cup of coffee.  tasty and worth it."
1.0,Are they suppose to be gross?,"Now I'm not sure if I should have gone with a different brand, or what but these were horrible. I used the microwave because I will not deep fry food, I followed the direction exactly. They made my microwave stink, along with the kitchen. Took awhile to get the taste out of my mouth too."
5.0,Easy to make and tasty,"Just a little hot water from an electric kettle and some chopped onions, maybe peppers or some salsa to spice it up, and you've got a delicious and easy batch of re-fried beans.  I sometimes put left over rice in the mix as well for a little more nutrition."
1.0,Terrible,"This coffee is absolutely the worst, do not even think about wasting your money on this. On the bright side it made me realise how good the nespressso coffee is."
1.0,Not what it appears to be,"The package shows fresh berries so you might assmume these are made from dried berries and chocolate.  The ingredients say something very different.... fruit juice concentrate boiled up w corn syrup and cane sugar, thickened and covered w choc.  Sugar - sugar and more sugar.  Buyer beware."
1.0,"Um, why so much $$ when the product is worth $12.99 from the store?",I'm not sure why somone would sell this for $30+ dollars on amazon.com when you can get it at the actual store fo 12.99 and get it online for the same price.  Am I missing something here??
5.0,YUM!,"I have had many different kinds of coffee. I have also become excited about many different coffees I have purchased because they smelled like they would taste like chocolate, caramel, vanilla, etc. They NEVER have! So, when we found this at our local Big Lots (I know! Score!) I wasn't expecting much. Oh my gosh! I was pleasantly surprised! BEST TASTING coffee, period! It actually tasted like chocolate and caramel and my house smelled AMAZING for hours after I brewed just one cup! Excited to see that Amazon carries it and that almost all the reviewers think it is as great as I think it is. I will be purchasing this through Amazon now, as I don't think I will find it elsewhere in our small town."
5.0,One of thee best tasting Coffee's I've ever had...You can believe in me Mr. Bean,"Atten: All you Foldgers coffee drinkers out there this coffee is not for you it is way way out of your league..This coffee is best drank black to get the full flavor of this rich tasting coffee, in my opinion cream and sugar will ruin the taste a real coffee contasure is looking for out of a great cup of coffee...This is one of the best tasting coffee's I've ever had...This is definitely a Blue Ribbon First Place Coffee, bottom line a must try..( You will love it )... You can count on this coffee to put a smile on your face..  From Mr. Bean"
5.0,Smokehouse 130 Count Puffed Lambs Ears,"This is the best buy I have found and my dog just goes crazy happy when I give the treat. I do hope you will get this back in stock in the future,"
1.0,Unfresh product,"I am very disappointed in this product.  The first box was 75% hard, not a soft powder in each envelope.  When I called to complain, I got fast results in getting a new box.  The new box was 25% hard.  I do not blame Saco, but whoever stored it incorrectly or for too long.  The fresher envelopes did make great buttermilk biscuits."
5.0,Always delicious.,You can count on Valbreso to be always creamy and a bit less salty than other fetas.  Reliably wonderful!  Good for when one has guests who dislike very strong flavors.  And the goat is a very cute goat!
1.0,This product used to be GREAT,"I loved cheesy hashbrowns until sometime last year, when they redid the recipe...now the potatoes never seem to get fully cooked, the sauce tastes disgusting, and the whole thing sucks.  I miss the old stuff to the point that I have actually looked to trade or buy packages of the older style, to no avail :-("
1.0,Mom says it is yucky,"My family eats and likes 100% whole wheat pasta, crackers and bread, so I thought we'd like this mac n cheese, too. This product tastes awful. What a bummer to own 12 boxes of yucky mac n cheese! I tried mixing it with other mac n cheese to make it tastier, but nothing can overcome the bad taste of this pasta. I finally threw the remaining Hodgson Whole Wheat Macaroni in the trash and kept the cheese packets to sprinkle on popcorn."
1.0,LOL @ JIFF'S MISLEADING USE OF NATURAL,"WARNING: This peanut butter is NOT natural.  It has ADDED sugar.  If you don't believe me, check the manufacturer's website.  It's probably just a ""coincidence"" that Amazon fails to provide the Nutritional Facts for this item.  [...]"
5.0,Delicious!,I remember these from when I was a kid...I'm 58!!  They are still wonderful. And the prices at Amazon are unbeatable!
5.0,Great taster and gluten free!,Great price and tasty gluten free!  My whole family LOVES this thin pasta.
5.0,"PG Tips, warms the heart of any ex-Brit","There really isn't much I can say.  If you've had PG Tips you know the difference.  If you haven't you don't know what your missing.  I'm from the UK originally and for years in the States I drank Lipton as it was the only brand I could readily find.  But along came Amazon and restored my access to my favorite tea.  If you're used to drinking Lipton, PG TIps has a stronger flavor and if you brew it real strong it can get bitter on you.  However I used to use 2 Lipton bags to get the strength I like and just one PG Tips bag does the job nicely.  If you're not sold, wait until it goes on sale or special and at least try one box.  Its particularly good if you brew it in a proper ceramic or china teapot rather than making it directly in a cup.  Actually that is one thing to note.  These tea bags don't have little strings so make sure you've got something handy to fish them out with.  From an Eco-friendly perspective I also like the fact that you only have the tea bags and the main box they come in.  Only the plastic shrink wrap is not recyclable.  If you drink a lot of tea using individually wrapped tea bags you are going to be generating a lot of unnecessary waste.  Particularly for those teas in plastic envelopes.  At least in Lipton's favor they do use paper wrappers you can recycle."
5.0,Outstanding tea,"I am a tea lover, and for once I am delighted with this tea. Elaichi means cardamom in Urdu.  With just the right amount of cardamom this tea has delicious taste with outstanding aroma. Loved it."
1.0,Moldy Shells,"I've been buying the generic Jewel Foods brand peanuts the past 9 months to get my daughter to have more protein in her diet. When Hampton came out with the baseball labels, I bought the Cubs since I lived on the North side of Chicago almost 20 years near Wrigley Field, not really a baseball fan but a peanut fan that lived on the North side of Chicago. Anyway, so many of the peanuts were moldy on the outside shell (threw them out), or shriveled and black on the inside(threw them out), or not roasted enough and had that moist bite you don't want in a salted roasted peanut. Very disappointing I will continue to buy the store generic brand which was much better in consistency, taste, roasted and salted quality. Being a Chicagoan my whole life I did wonder if the Cubs bag got the rejects. Only added to the fact that I won't buy these again."
5.0,Wonderful for breakfast AND snacks!,"I almost can't stop eating this cereal...I eat it for breakfast and then in the evening, when I think I want something to eat and am really not hungry, I snack on these.  After all, it's healthy, so long as I remembeer it's not healthy to eat a cup or more.  Enjoy!"
1.0,Awful!,I love chocolate cereal and I love Cap'N'Crunch so I was excited to try this. Gag me. It's awful. I don't know who taste tested this before it came out but they apparently arent familiar with the taste of chocolate. I dont know what this taste is?! I would like to give no stars.
1.0,Waxy and flavorless,The numerous 5 star ratings on here sound like they come from ghiaradelli marketing dept. This peppermint bark is the worst I've ever had. Waxy and tastes like cheap chocolate that skimps on quality. Peppermint oil not even listed as ingredient and instead Filled with preservatives and artificial coloring and flavorings.  Save your money and buy some quality chocolate instead.
5.0,A really good buy and great quality,"I make a lot of waffles, pancakes and French toast.  There is nothing like real maple syrup.  This brand is excellent.  I don't care a whit about what ""grade"" it is.  It tastes fabulous, very rich, you don't need very much on a piece of French toast.  I could buy pure maple syrup at home, but it costs over a third more, and since I have Prime (and use it all the time) it makes it even better."
5.0,YES!,"Customers who rate this product five star are absolutely right.  If there's such a thing as a gourmet sardine, this is it.  I opened a can just after delivery and knew after first taste I'll order more."
1.0,"truth in adver, please","At $11 I took a chance, expecting a 16oz or at least 12ox...  This is a 8.5oz and they do not disclose size in the produc description and conveniently obscure the size on the label."
1.0,Wrong sampler pack,"My wife just resolved an argument about whether we received the hot chocolate sampler I ordered a week or two ago. We both recall receiving the package - I opened it, quickly looked at the printed language in the corners of the box which had the names of different hot chocolates (I didn't actually look at the K-cups themselves) and left it for my spouse to put away. A few days later I was looking for the hot chocolate - and we couldn't find it.  Turns out that despite the packaging the K-cups were NOT hot chocolate but a variety of coffees.  Too late to return it - but beware."
5.0,I am nuts for corn nuts,"If you've never had corn nuts the best way I can describe them is by stating that they are hard, crunchy, salty and definetly require that you eat them with a beverage. The best snack I can compare it to are the crunchy japanase peas but more dense and with a corn taste ;)  However, if this your first experience with corn nuts, I recommend the Rach flavor or original unless your into spicy. They aren't super spicy but they are tangy. I love to eat them with lime and additional chile sauce (like tapatio)."
5.0,My dogs love it!,I have two pit mixes and they both chow down when i give it to them. They even get super excited when i get the can out to get ready to feed them.
1.0,Very disappointed,Too bad I didn't notice the ingredient until after purchase.  It has too much sugar and uses sulfur dioxide for color retention.
1.0,Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia,If you buy these you run the risk of getting rancid nut cookies. They looked a bit odd and tasted even odder. One cookie was bitter. I guess it was the tiny macadamia nut bits that were the problem. Don't buy them!
5.0,Best cereal ever,"I fell in love with Weetabix on a recent vacation to Ireland. This North American version tastes and looks the same as what I was eating over there. My favorite aspect of Weetabix is that the cereal box is completely full of food, you are not buying a box half full of air. This is more earth friendly than most cereals. Also the large biscuits make portion control easy. I eat three every morning, usually with sliced up banana. You have to keep the milk carton close by to keep everything moist as you eat your breakfast. Weetabix... it's good stuff. Now I just need to find a place to buy one of those cool tins like they had in my bed and breakfast over in Ireland."
1.0,OK!,"The sprayer is to wide, if eating around others and they don't want HOT SAUCE they get it any way. I like the taste & its good and HOT."
1.0,Price per pound is great.  Shipping is the killer.,"I see a lot of gripes about the price of this item.  At approximately $2.00 per pound, this can't be beat.  So, I put two in my cart.  The over $16.00 in shipping (cheapest ground available) turned me off!  That negates the great price per pound.  This seller needs to reevaluate their shipping costs. Like others have said, this review is no reflection on the candy itself, only on the seller."
5.0,100% Mangosteen Juice,"I personally know several people who recently tried this new 100 percent mangosteen juice. The juice is ""Mangosteen Queen"" sold at the mangosteenjuice.ws that is similar to the Dynamic Health Gold mangosteen.  These individuals report higher energy levels probably due to sleeping better and disappearance of pains they have had prior to drinking these type of mangosteen juices.  One even received comments of looking ten years younger without soliciting for it.  I for one lost my suceptibility to allergy due to pollen in the fall; something I have had for many decades. I must admit that I only drank this pure mangosteen for maybe at most 3 days at a time for perhaps 4 times since August due to cost. Drinking it even inconsistently at 1/2 to 2/3 cup a day has its rewards apparently."
1.0,Sent wrong product,"I ordered the Ice Breakers Frost Mint Wintercool and ended up with plain Ice Breakers Wintergreen.  Too much of a hassle to return, so I will give them away.  Very unhappy!"
5.0,Third Time's The Charm,"I had an ""El Cheapo"" espresso/coffee combo from Krups that worked well for many years until the pump gave out. I scoured the Internet for a worthy machine that I could depend on and purchased one of the Breville espresso makers. I returned it the next day. It made terrible weak coffee. Then I happened to be wandering through Wal Mart and saw a $70.00 Hamilton Beach machine. It made great coffee with crema and it was strong enough to froth milk. The next morning, I went to make a cup and the machine had leaked all over my countertop! I was lucky to have unplugged it the night before or else there could have been an electrical fire. Back to Wal Mart it went.  Neither of these machines were automatic and I had to grind my own coffee beans (which I prefer, even with my regular coffee). I saw the Saeco, read the reviews and said, ""If this doesn't perform, I'm not making espresso ever again."" When it arrived, I followed the ""Quick Start"" instructions and filled the hopper with my French roast beans. I crossed my fingers and pressed the ""On"" button. When all the lights were ready, I pressed the ""Coffee"" button. In about 15 seconds I had one of the most beautiful cups of espresso complete with a heady froth of crema!  I was so impressed, I made another cup. Ahhh, heavenly. Of course, I couldn't sleep that night - the caffeine replaced the blood in my veins.  The milk steamer wand is also mighty powerful. It froths milk just like a commercial machine. Something my Krups didn't do very well.  In summation, this is a wonderful machine in its price range. I highly recommend it. Oh, and by the way, the clown who gave it a 1-star review? That's a hoax. There is no such wording on the box or in the manual."
1.0,Horrible - why'd they change it?,"I agree with the other reviewer - the new lower sugar formulation is awful ... it tastes like aspartame.  We're never buying this again, and I'm faced with a similar dilemma: this has been my favorite for years.  Note: Since writing this review, I have tried McCann's Maple & Brown Sugar oatmeal (available on Amazon), and it's great.  I highly recommend it as a substitute if you're equally unhappy with Quaker's reformulation (or don't want to waste your money trying it)."
5.0,taste great..crunchy and nutritious,"Nothing added and flavorful for freeze dried. They do stick to your teeth after they get chewy in your mouth. Surprisingly there minimal vitamin content...no C. Great snack for travel, sports, kid treat cuz it' s just mango and nothing more."
5.0,never got it,"Due to a failure in the packing of this item, it was returned before even getting here. I strongly recommend that the packing department does a better job, because i ordered it again and this time one of the boxes was damaged. Apart from all that, the product is great."
1.0,ordered sugar free decaf.. and got something different,"I was a bit upset at the fact that i had ordered sugar-free decaf international coffee's and got decaf with sugar..however, I was away on vacation and did not get back for a month, when other members of my family opened items and used some of it, so I could not return the full package. So, as it stands, I won't be drinking the 6 cans I bought, guest and family members will enjoy them. ( disappointed )"
1.0,Too Much Inorganic Arsenic,"Consumer Reports rated these crackers the highest in inorganic arsenic of all the rice crackers on the market. I like these crackers, but will no longer eat them until the arsenic issue in brown rice is resolved."
1.0,Was Favorite Before the Vanilla Version,"I loved this tea before the vanilla was added, when it was just plain honeybush tea.  It was delicious.  The addition of vanilla really changed the flavor, and I do not like it at all now.  It seems bitter."
5.0,Excellent coffee.,Yuban has been a family favorite for years. Buying by the case is convenient and cost effective.
5.0,Great taste of white truffle oil,We were unable to get to mushroom festival in kennett square this year soo we decided to order stuff on line !!! Very pleased....
5.0,so good it's pornographic,"I eat it right out of the jar but slowly because it's expensive. The other reviewer is right, it does taste like a sweet icing, but it doesn't have that cloyingly gross after eating a few bites feeling I get from icing. A very mild honey that doesn't change the flavor of the tea. In fact, I think it's actually wasted in tea. It tastes too good to dilute."
1.0,Yuck yuck and yuck!,"This stuff tastes awful.  It has a horrible after taste whether you mix it in drinks or not.  It's just as bad if not worse than the other fake sweeteners like Splenda, Sweet n Low, etc.  NOT recommended!"
5.0,Apple Cinnamon Tea is great,"I don't drink American teas so I special order them about once a year. I never tasted this brand before unlike teas made in the US you can actually smell the apple aroma, it's a rich great tasting tea and I intend to buy it again.The price was very reasonable and it helps that it qualified for no shipping.   Stash Premium Apple Cinnamon Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) "
5.0,Great hot chocolate!,"My kids love this and I do too. My son, who is a chocoholic, describes this as a ""liquid Hershey bar!"". He likes it with marshmallows. We are not big fans of the powdered hot cocoa."
1.0,Terrible Taste !!,this is the so far the most terrible taste of drie frut i had ever tryed it in my life !!!  it does not even close taste like a papaya !! nada !!  the others review they lie !!
5.0,Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate with Marzipan,"Delicious, high quality dark chocolate with moist marzipan filling. Excellent, as only the European products can be; best chocolate in the world."
1.0,MexGrocer corn husks,"I read all the reviews before I bought the corn husks and it was all good reviews so I went ahead and orderd 3 packages. Big mistake the first package was all dirty with bugs, corn silk, and mold. I expect the package to have some corn silk and some (2 or 3 ) molded husks, but when I have to throw all 3 bags,  away that makes me mad and I'm not going to return husks I already opend and tried to wash. So it was a big waste of my money and thoses of you who gave them a good review were either working for them, lieing or are lucky they got good husks."
5.0,Tea,"Very light in taste, but very giood, ty! Also, very fast service! I really enjoyed this prodect! I would order this again! Ty!"
5.0,"Great coffee, great value","We drink a lot of coffee in our house, and this is about the best value for great coffee you will find. It is very mellow, rich and flavorful. And at the subscribe and save price, it's cheaper than grocery store coffee-plus, I'll never run out!"
1.0,My son hates this,"I am not sure what the problem is with this one , maybe it's the ginger, he loves all the othe sprout foods. This one he spits out"
1.0,Hmm,"Diet Coke is delicious, and I drink it pretty much all day. Cross your fingers I don't get kidney stones or something. My experience drinking Diet Coke has lead me to get plenty of caffeine in my system without getting fat from the sugar, which I happen to like.  However.  Buying 24 cans of Diet Coke at ~$40 shipped works out to $1.62 per can. This is well above the accepted price for Diet Coke, in fact... like 6x more. If this vendor could get their price down to something reasonable I'd be happy to order a bunch. If they expect me to pay 2x what it costs in an expensive vending machine, I'll just stick with that, thanks."
1.0,This is a lie!,"This ad is a lie! This order came today and the steaks are not any bigger than two store bought pork chops. There is no way these steaks weigh anywhere close to 30 ounces, much less a total of 60 ounces as the ad states! $72 for not even a pound of steak! RIP OFF!"
5.0,Great coffee !!,"This was purchased for my husband, a huge coffee fan.  He was impressed with the robust flavor of Starbucks  Sumatra."
1.0,Not a great taste and sugar is the first ingredient,"I was really looking forward to this product. I love all berries. I bought it to flavor Kefir (yogurt drink). I've tried it that way and also with crushed ice as the bottle reccomends. Niether I nor my two kids liked either one. Also, I should have read the ingredients closely before I purchased it. It's more sugar than berries. Amazon as always did a great job with the shipping of the order."
1.0,Tasted so bad couldn't even use it,I purchased this color along with the gold and silver and all that i can say is that it doesn't taste like it should edible. I threw all of it out and I was very dispointed that I wasted my money and time with this product.
5.0,The best!,"I really love these lollipops. Because they are all natural, the flavor is much 'cleaner' and they taste great. This is a great example that 'unjuncked' treats can be preferred by kids over artificial stuff. I can also give them out to other kids without having to worry about allergy concerns. For this reason it is great for birthday party bags or Halloween."
1.0,NOT HAPPY !,I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CAT WHO ADORES GRASS AFTER HIS DINNER EVERY NIGHT.  IT ONLY PARTLY CAME UP AND DID NOT REMAIN FOR MORE THAN 3 DAYS.  I HAVE ORDERED MANY KINDS OF GRASS AND THIS ONE IS ONE OF THE WORST.
1.0,DID NOT GET WHAT I ORDERED,"I ORDERED THE BLACK LABLED BOTTLE THEY ADVERTIZED,  SWEETEND WITH KANE SUGAR. AND THEY SENT ME THE BLUE LABLED BOTTLE SWEETEND WITH CORN SYRUP. I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH AMAZON BECAUSE I HAVE ORDERED OTHER THINGS AND GOT WHAT I BOUGHT"
1.0,Old cereal,"I recieved my order for Honey Nut Cheerios today, 03-09-2011. The best by date for the boxes I recieved was 03/2011. Really? thats the best U can do."
1.0,Skip the Guava and eat the box!,"This was really one of the worst purchases I have made online. The fruit would not ripen and finally had to be discarded. The photos are lovely and the description ""Guavas have a subtle and floral flavor with sweet and sour undertones. Soft and creamy when ripe, Guavas have a fully edible rind and small seeds that are edible too. No one can resist its rare and irresistible floral aroma. One bite will transport you to a tropical paradise. "" was really enticing.  Sadly, not only was I not transported to the tropical paradise, no floral aroma and certainly not creamy they never ripened.  Of course, had the fruit ripened I would have enjoyed the delightful fragrance that only Guava can give and would have relished every bite."
1.0,"Fraud, overpriced for nothing","Another reviewer got it right,you pay double for nothing. This guy just uses science backed by his own foundation to make ridiculous claims...don't fall into this sort of trap and don't waste your time with this product/seller..."
5.0,chuckles candy,Great purchase!  My husband loves chuckles candies so this was a great father's day gift for him!  Everything about this transaction was smooth and problem free!
5.0,BUY ELSEWHERE,You can find this 6-pack for $40 dollars less at diapers.com.  No reason they should be charging this much.
1.0,FDA Warns Chicken Jerky From China May Harm or Kill Your Dog.,"STOP USING THIS PRICEY JUNK NOW!! search ""chicken jerky treats china"" on google for more info and SPREAD THE WORD (some media coverage but way too little...) I am ""fortunate""... my dog only suffered small amount of kidney damage-- others are not so lucky. Remember the Chinese pet food scandal in 2007 that killed 1000's of our best friends. TELL AMAZON  NOT TO SELL CHINESE CHICKEN JERKY until it is proven safe (and even then I'd avoid it)"
1.0,Green Mountain Half-Caff,"A real dissapointment.  With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years.  When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't.  This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater.  Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery.  Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf.  All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf.  I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great.  The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees.  Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste.  Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and decaff coffees and deep six this product."
5.0,For a healthy sugar free diet this is the best,"For those of us who are both sugar conscious and health conscious this is an excellent choice. The taste is great and it avoids the problems you can have with too much stevia.  A great product that avoids chemical (asparatame, nutrasweet, splenda, etc.) sweeteners that are known neuro-toxins.  In one word - Excellent."
5.0,best chocolates available,"These country-specific Cachet chocolates are, in my opinion, the best available anywhere. Costa Rica and Uganda tie, for me, as the best darks. Each has its own personality (Uganda's has a bit more of a fruity bite to it), and when you let it melt slowly in your mouth... outstanding!"
5.0,Love it,"I'm not sure about the weight loss aspect of this, I have lost weight but I have no idea if it has anything to do with this stuff, either way that's not why I bought it. I bought this for the supposed antioxidants and I've continued to use it because I love the taste and I suspect it's also been giving me an energy boost... another aspect which I can only guess on but can't really quallify. I mostly use this in smoothies, but it's also really good just mixed in greek yogurt and I've added it to iced tea several times. The packaging for all Navitas Naturals products is easilly ripped, especially at the top where it seals, this is something that bothers me but since I love their products I've just decided to overlook that and invest in some bag clips."
1.0,Not noticeable,"I used this sparkle for my daughter's birthday cake, but the sparlkes did not show at all so its just a waste of time unless you are putting it on a dark color cake."
1.0,Didn't get what was pictured,"The assortment being sold here is not what is pictured.  This is a pack of 12, 4.5-ounce bags of the Runts assortment with the pineapple and mango.  You don't get the cherry, lime, or blue raspberry.  Amazon needs to update their photos, because when the assortment changed this drastically, it created a completely different (and much worse) candy.  It's sad that Runts felt they had to destroy the product that made them popular. I've read a comment stating that the new assortments are better than not having Runts at all.  I disagree.  I'd rather have nothing than have this new assortment, if I have to pay for it.  If you're looking for the old assortment that sold so well for decades, don't buy these!  If you find that old assortment with the lime and cherry somewhere, let me know.  I'll go to great lengths to get more of those, but I wouldn't pay anything for the new assortments."
5.0,My husband loves these!!,"I bought these fat free wheat free fig bars for my son, and both he and my husband love them.  I was impressed by the flavor and these fig bars are moist.  These were better than my expectations!"
5.0,My dogs and sister love these things.,"My dogs love these things.  Alas, so does my sister.  I had four of them on the kitchen cabinet when she made one of her unannounced and unwanted visits.  With out asking, she grabbed one, ate it and loved it.  I was tempted to stop her, but let her finish off the other three.  The dogs looked at her rather oddly as they are a bit brighter than she is.  Hmmm, perhaps I could use them to house break her....you know, treats for doing right and all that!  Just a thought.  Anyway, even if you do not have an obnoxious sister, the dogs will live these things anyway.  I think I will wait for the next family gathering to break the news to her."
1.0,Terrible allergic type response to the cookies,"I am on a gluten free diet and hoped these would be  a welcome addition.  The taste is nothing special, a little too chewy and dry, but for me the huge down-side was an awful skin reaction; hive-like itchy outbreak within 30-45 minutes of eating these.  I do have some food allergies, but saw nothing on the label that concerned me.  I will be working with my allergist to try to determine the problem.  Meantime, I am not planning to touch these cookies again."
5.0,"All natural ingredients, great taste","We have a 12 year old Akita dog that has developed food-related allergies and intolerance as she has gotten older. Akitas as a breed are also more sensitive to chemicals. For this reason, we're very selective about what dog food and dog treats we buy. Wet Noses is one of the few dog treat lines which meets all our requirements, and our dog LOVES these treats! Wet Noses uses all organic ingredients and stays away from ingredients such as corn, wheat and soy to which dogs are more likely to be allergic. Every ingredient appears to have been selected to give exceptional nutrition for the money and for the calories it provides. We bought the sweet potato treat, a flavor dogs seem to love but which is rarely found in commercial dog food. (Before we found this line of dog treats, we used to add pieces of sweet potato to our dog's regular commercial dog food.) We were also impressed that Wet Noses uses quality ingredients such as rye flour, turmeric, sesame paste, cumin and cinnamon. All of these ingredients appear to have been included not only to make these treats taste good, but also for their health benefits. I would highly recommend this product. The treats are a little over an inch in diameter."
1.0,Cake does not look like it is shown in picture,"Shipping for cake was fine. We got the cake on day we requested for. Packing of cake was not so great. When we opened cake there was not ""Happy birthday"" note on the cake. No design of flowers as shown in picture. The cake was just plain. It was so disappointing. Also the cake is too small for the price these guys are charging."
5.0,amazingly delicious!,"While in Dublin, I stopped by Butlers and picked up a few different types of chocolate. While they are all good, this one is simply amazing. Everyone in my family (and extended family) raved about it (we had to ration pieces so all could try it). Just let it melt in your mouth and savor the flavor. We must get more!"
1.0,How is this a Savings?,"I really like this product, however in doing the math, i can't figure out how this is a savings, in fact it's a rip off on this site! I can go to my local target (which i have been doing), and buy this exact product (32oz) for $5.99 a can, on here it's roughly $10.00 a can.................Again, where is the savings and why is so expensive on amazon?????"
1.0,Yuck!,This is the third time I ordered cheese from this company. It came extremely fast when ordered thru Amazon however you'll receive a 10% off discount card and be urged to order direct from the company in your box. When you do however it will take much longer to receive that shipment. The cheese that I received today and used in my recipe tasted like nothing...powder. It's tasteless almost like they forgot to add something. I'll be throwing the remainder of the cheese away. It'll be a crapshoot whether you'll get something like I got this time or maybe if you're lucky you'll get a good one. I wouldn't waste another dime with them.
1.0,stale,"i purchased a mixed pack and was pleased with the product,until i opened one of the banana w acai packets.i smelled something pretty strong and discovered the odor was from the product in the bag.it was,spoiled,something was going on. i e-mailed funky monkey,to try and find out if their was a problem with this combo- flavor,never even heard back from them.they can keep their product as far as i'm concerned,because they certainly dont care. Funky Monkey Snacks Variety Pack, Freeze-Dried Fruit, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) "
5.0,Me eat cookie!,"The other reviewers have accurately described the Carr's Ginger Lemon Creme Cookies - they will delight your tastebuds. I treat my co-workers or visitors - and I treat myself when I feel I need a slight boost. They go well with coffee, tea, soda, milk, in fact, they go well with no drink at all. Yes, they bring out the cookie monster. It is very hard to eat just one of these cookies."
5.0,Training Treats for everyone,I am a professional dog trainer. I recommend these to all my clients.  They are small enough to use on big dogs and can be broken up for puppies and smaller dogs.  The puppies and dogs love them.  I buy them by the case and they are re-sealable for later on.
5.0,Lovely way to start the day,I look forward every morning to my first cup of this lovely Numi tea. This delightful blend of all my favorite black teas holds up well to my embelishment of a little stevia. It's the perfect ritual to start my day.  It's a bit spendy but cheaper here at Amazon than at my local health food store and worth every penny.  Numi represents a truly excellent organic product.
5.0,Pricey but worth it,"My 2 month old began having screaming and constipation problems while I was using the orange similac powder.  We decided to switch him to the blue similac powder, nothing changed.  We even had abd x-ray done since the constipation continued to last for 7 days at a time each time, all normal.  After reading I found alot of the reviews were saying powder was different from the ready to feed.  We switched to this and within 12 hours had a pooping nonscreaming baby.  He was happy and not crying or pulling legs up constantly.  The ingredients in powder are different then the ready to feed.  Definetly worth the extra money to make our baby feel well."
1.0,Don't waste your money,"I was looking forward to trying this soup based on the excellent reviews posted about this product. Imagine my surprise when I opened one and discovered that 80% of the bowl was chicken broth--and not a very tasty one at that. The remainder of the soup consisted of a few small pieces of chicken along with a little rice, celery and such.  There is no way this product is worth over $3 a bowl. This is one of the biggest ripoffs I ever seen. If you like chicken and rice, try Hormel Compleats."
1.0,Anyone want something lacking flavor???,"I was disgusted by this ""hot chocolate"". You MUST use it with milk - using water is by far the most disgusting thing I have ever tried to drink. Even with the warm milk - you need several extra scoops of this to make it taste even okay. It was a TOTAL waste of money. I dontaed the other 3 cans to the food pantry. There is no flavor to it - just makes the milk kind of greasy until you add about 5 or 6 scoops - then you get at least a chocolate flavor. Being that I LOVE Ghirardelli chocolate bars I expected soemthing MUCH better than this garbage."
5.0,yummm,for being sold in lbs for 3 or 4 dollars this was such a steal I couldnt leave this in stock! Delievery was less than 3 days came exactly as described no melted bears and just yummy. I wish it came in a resealable bag! I purchased this at 10 dollars and the next day it was at 24 dollars so I am glad I picked up the steal when I did!
1.0,"Expensive brown rice, cheaper elsewhere","This is expensive for a 50 lb bag.  I looked around for a long time, found that it was the most economical at cos*co, one of the membership stores.  It isn't available at the regular warehouses, but at 'cos*co business' store.  You don't need to have a business membership card to go there.  Price - $ 14.21 for a 25 lb bag, I live in Phoenix, AZ and there is one such store near I-17 and Indian School road. J"
1.0,Rip Off,"Are you kidding me?  At least in my area, Fairfax County, Virginia, there are plenty of places you can go to buy Mexican Coke for a dollar a bottle.  Try places like Shoppers Food Warehouse, any number of ethnic grocers, even some gas stations.  Just beware- Coke is bottling the ""'merican"" coke in small bottles, so make sure it is Mexican coke you're buying.  IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD!  Oh by the way, this seller is a huge rip-off."
1.0,disappointed and overprices,I have been so anxious to try other flavors for my Keurig coffee maker. I want to find something like a cappucino. I bought the Cafe Mocha Cafe Escapes and it tastes just like the hot chocolate and with shipping it was almost $20.00. I was very disappointed.
1.0,Not What I Ordered,"Truly Indian Kashmiri Palak Paneer, 15.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)  This is a non-review of ""Truly Indian Kashmiri Palak Paneer"" as I did not receive that item. Instead, I was sent ""Truly Indian Delhi Dal Makhani,"" which turned out to be excellent; if I get the time, I'll write a review for that.  As of this writing, there are two reviews for Palak Paneer, and neither of us received the item ordered--way to go, shippers!  So, check out the link below for a tasty dish, but be forewarned; if you chow down a whole can of this stuff, you will have consumed a whole day's ration of salt!   Truly Indian Delhi Dal Makhani, 15.8 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) "
5.0,Best Barbque Sauce,"This is the absolute best Barbque sauce and the only one I buy and use.  The big problem, it is very very difficult to find.  I live in the Phila area, a huge metropolis and no stores, NONE, carry it.  Thank goodness , I can buy it on Amazon.  I used to drive down to Claymont Delaware to buy it at Food Lion, but now they don't even carry it.  People , wake up, buy it and use it, it's the BEST!"
5.0,Good value - Our Labrador pup loves likes them,"These pork chomps mini knotz are of very good value. For the 21 count, I purchased it for $10. Other products with similar size and weight was in the $20 range.  Our Labrador pup likes these bones and definitely keeps her occupied. Give it as a treat or hide it, either way it keeps them busy.  The knotz are about 2 - 3 inches in length and about half an inch wide. The size varies, but that's the rough size of the bones.  Overall, I'm satisfied with the product. If my dog could, she would say so too."
1.0,Well.. it's not coffee...,"First, it's not coffee. It's an instant powdered mix, which is completely disappointing. I was expecting flavored coffee, not instant mix in a small container. Kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?  I guess it's my fault for not having read the package? But no where in the product description does it indicate this is ""Instant Coffee"".  I would never buy this product again.  It smells wonderful, but tastes like what it is, and that's simply not good for someone looking for a cup of coffee."
1.0,Buy Something Else,"I bought this food for my already sick cat and he hated it so much he lost 2 more pounds and refused to eat it. This is coming from a cat who'll eat almost anything including spaghetti, yogurt, oatmeal and lettuce. Stay away from this; it really was a bad choice for my cat."
1.0,Good taste. Bad side effects,"Tasted great. Gave me terrible gas. Too many trips to the bathroom. Even after I diluted the product, half water half juice it still cause problems. It has to be diluted so much that there is just a bitter taste left."
1.0,Crushed Too!,"My bag of Stonewall Kitchens Yellow Tortilla Chips was also crushed.  I'm glad I was still able to use them to top Tortilla Soup.  The flavor was good.  I like the sea salt.  Packing needs to be better.  Don't pack with heavy items in the same box, Amazon!!"
5.0,Same as TJs,"My husband eats these sardines, usually a can a day.  He had wanted better Omega 3s to help his blood pressure, but had generally found sardines to be ""fishy"".  He wanted something he could tolerate eating regularly and did a lot of research online.  He found that Trader Joe's Moroccon sardines got rave reviews.  So we started to buy out our local TJs of their stock every couple of weeks.  He commented once that he thinks his mind is clearer these days.  Don't know if it's helping with his blood pressure though.  I did taste them, and the taste reminds me of tuna.  My 2 year old daughter loves helping her daddy eat these.  I looked here on Amazon and found this listing, and read the reviews.  They were similar to the reviews for TJs.  I ordered a box, because we seem to run out of TJs before we can get more.  Hubby tried them and says there seems to be no difference in taste.  These are slightly more expensive than TJs if you just order just one box, but the price is better than TJs if you do the subscription.  Update 9/29/10:  My husband just went in for his bloodwork, and everything looks good - triglycerides, cholesterol, etc.  He's even no longer pre-diabetic.  Not sure how much of this is from eating a can of these a day, but I'm sure it's helping.  He even says his mind works better since he started eating these."
5.0,Very good bedtime tea or tea for car or motion sickness!,"I have been purchasing and drinking this tea for years.In fact since Mo Siegel used to advertise it on TV..now that is a long time ago. It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed. But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sickness.  Our oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time. We carried an endless supply of ""baggies"" for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to school.  We discovered that this tea, given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely. The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves."
5.0,"Perfect cereal: Tastes good, interesting, high fiber, not too sweet","I'm generally not a big cereal eater. I eat this cereal dry as a snack, which has been great for my waistline. Instead of eating junk, I can eat something healthy, high in fiber, and filling. I don't get hungry for hours. Sometimes there are big clusters and other times a lot of crumbs, depending on settling, but it always tastes good. A slight cinnamon flavor with a satisfying crunch. It's hard to watch TV while eating due to all of the crunching. :-) It's definitely worth a try (I have never commented on a food before, so you know this has got to be good...)"
5.0,zingy,"I ordered these for my nephews who are now at college and cooking for themselves. They asked me if I'd send some from home, but ordered them some instead. The order arrived in a very timely manner and the guys are cooking up a storm."
1.0,What A Price,"It Is $13.98 At Sams, And Amazon Is Selling It For $24.82  The Dogs Do Like Them, But $24.82 I Think I Will Pass"
1.0,Did not like it,"I was looking forward to trying this beverage mix. I mixed it as directed with 250ml (8 oz) of hot water. It dissolved quickly.  And just FYI, the color of the drink was darker than that pictured on the box. It was a murky brown color. As far as flavor goes, the ginger was just too strong and nasty. I didn't like it at all."
5.0,Bella loves them.,My year old Lasa loves these treats and they don't upset her delicate tummy.  They arrived quickly and I plan to order more soon.
1.0,Size Matters,"VERY DISAPPOINTING! Wow... talk about SMALL!!  this is in a 9"" x 9"" box sub divided by four smaller containers.  Very small portions for the large price!  I can get my fruit and nuts in states other than Cali. if this is what everything costs.  Save your money, go to your grocery and make your own fruit/nut tray.  You'll get 3 x's the amount and will look much better."
1.0,Ugh!,Stale Coffee. Foil lid does not stay intact and gets grounds all over...apparently they did not have this issue fixed like they stated.
5.0,"awesome, as long as you adjust the recipe","helped my family go gluten free with me. I have celiac and am extremely sensitive. My family loves it after I tinkered with the recipe. I was way to mushy. The main thing, is take out 1 egg yolk, add a 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and sugar, 1 teaspoon vinegar cider, I also had to add a few degrees to the oven and a few minutes. The neighbors now ask for my bread!"
1.0,50.99?!?!?!?,"I wouldn't pay $50.99 for 12 of these if my mother was on fire and had to douse out the flames, that is a ridiculous price."
1.0,Lentils,"Not a good product, impossible to cook well! I will not buy this product again. Label recipe is useless. Try something esle!"
1.0,Bait And Switch,"I've purchased this water for a year now for the high alkaline content and the great taste.  Recently, I've been getting shipments that are NOT the New Zealand spring water but rather distilled water from Walnut Creek, California.  The taste difference IS night and day.  You can only tell the difference between the original New Zealand Spring water and the distilled water from Walnut Creek by looking at the label.  Therefore, I won't be buying any more Eternal Water on the internet; you must actually see the label to know you're getting what you paid for. This is dishonest on Eternal's part -- I hope they literally clean up their act."
5.0,Ahhh - a lovely cuppa!,A nice robust but soft on the palate taste - works really well with milk. Nothing better than a pot of tea brewed from PG tips.
5.0,AMAZING WATER!,"I drink a bottle a day! It taste just like water with no funny after taste or funny taste during drinking. I find it keeps me well energized, cuts out my cravings to overeat and it is full of so many minerals that my body is a well ran machine! I highly recommend this for any and everyone, especially people who get sick easily and have poor immune systems."
5.0,Great snack!,Good crunchy snack that is lightly salted. The pouches were big enough for several snacks throughout the day. Nice to have something that is healthy to snack on.
1.0,Very different taste,I bought this product hoping it would taste good.  Our family did not like the taste and subsequently we threw the packages out.  Maybe just our taste.  We do each Japanese and Chinese often and we have lived in China.
5.0,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"I HAD ORDERED BACK TO NATURE GLUTEN FREE CRACKERS EARLIER, I WRONGLY ASSUMED THE CHEESE CRACKERS WERE ALSO GLUTEN FREE. I WAS HAPPILY ENJOYING MY FIRST BITE WHEN I NOTICED THEY WERE NOT GLUTEN FREE! I WAS GLAD I DID NOT GO FURTHER INTO THE BOX BUT SAD WHEN I REALIZED THAT I COULD NOT EAT THE REST! THE TASTE WAS GREAT HOWEVER!"
1.0,Still have not received this product.  Ordered almost one month ago.,I am very disappointed that I have not recived this product as of this time.  My cats are awaiting their treats!
1.0,Not this brand.  They made me sick.,"Two times, a week apart, for no apparent reason other than snacking on this product, I became violently ill.  I researched the potential side effects and becoming violently ill is not supposed to be one of them.  I cannot return the bag for a refund (thanks, Amazon) so I have to throw it out.  I will be trying another brand soon."
1.0,Inedible Due to High Salt Content,"I wanted so badly to love these peanuts.  The texture is absolutely perfect.  However, the salt quickly sneaks up on your.  They are over salted to the point eating them becomes physically painful.  Huge failure that could easily be turned into a success."
1.0,Worse than regular beer!,"I have been searching for a good ginger beer, trying to find something that might compare to Bundaberg Ginger Beer, and was EXTREMELY disappointed with Reed's.  I was looking for that sweet gingery flavor, with a nice strong bite, and found Reed's to be nothing more than a bland drink with a lingering burn, NOT a bite, that resembled heartburn more than the gingery spice blast of a decent ginger beer.  Reed's was rubbery tasting, and tastes similar to a cheap non-alcoholic beer.  I literally couldn't finish my first bottle.  I pride myself on being able to eat and drink just about anything... so to be unable to finish this drink says a lot.  Oh Bundaberg, why aren't you sold in US grocery stores???"
1.0,Healthy but tastes pretty bad,"I bought some to try cause of the health benefits, I've heard that this is one of the healthier kinds of tea.  I dunno, guess I'm just not a Pu-Erh person.  It tasted awful to me.  Smelled funky too.  I would not reccomend it unless you're a very serious tea drinker."
5.0,"Good food for baby, without a lot of additives","Earth's Best gives the babies what they need - nutrition, without giving them what they don't need - sugar, colors, and other additives."
1.0,An abomination unto the lord. . .,"It is appalling to me that anyone would produce this product and sell it as food. What's more appalling is that people eat it and not only support the misguided notion that this is something that could be considered food, but even go so far as to say that they ENJOY eating it, AND DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS. If this product were made of meat, I would be faced with no other viable conclusion than to think that it was made from the meat products rejected by a dog-food factory. But since it is not meat of any kind, what am I to think. . . ? Is this some kind of weird joke. . . ? What IS this THING in this can? And WHAT IS THAT SMELL? And this gravy of which they spake on the label, do they mean this slime? The slime that is more gross than spam slime? SO MANY QUESTIONS. . ."
5.0,Emeril's K-cups,"This is an item that I purchase at least every two months, it's a great tasting coffee and would recommend to everyone."
1.0,Worst taste. Bring back the old.,Kraft changed the bottle and taste. My kids and I don't like it and now I am searching for the last remaining bottles to buy before looking for another Catalina dressing. And it won't be this one. Why change a good thing?
5.0,Love em,"These Oral chews help keep my pets teeth clean between vet cleanings,even my vet noticed a difference in my pets teeth, once or twice a week."
1.0,WARNING ARSENIC,brown rice and rice in general has a lot of arsenic! any rice or brown rice syrup from texas and other southern states is dangerous! avoid this!!! when eating rice products buy rice from asia.
5.0,Silky smooth taste???,"I had to laugh at the product description. Those are the words to describe certain chocolates, not a water! Still, as a bit of a water taste snob, this is indeed great tasting water. We have well water that is absolutely vile to drink. I've found that there are great taste differences in bottled water, be it spring or filtered. I usually choose spring waters, but this product brings up the point that it can be produced anywhere, thus leaving a smaller carbon footprint. PH levels in the body are a hot issue right now...the new 'mangosteen', if you will. There are products to raise the pH of your own water, which is normally in the 7 range. If you've been following the pH trend in health, this water is a terrific beverage option."
1.0,Japanese Crap Do not buy this product,Wow this vinaigrette is probably the most disgusting thing i ever ate!  I just came back from Japan after staying there for more than a year i saw this a the local supermarket and bought it at 5$ which i pretty expensive for the quantity.  I thought that for 5$ i was betting on quality...  Wow was i wrong when i open the bottle an awful smell came out of it!  I currently live in canada and japanese steakhouse and real japanese salad dressing are two different thing. Wafu is not even in between!  My review?  Do not buy this product it is not worth it.
1.0,Misleading Advertisement,"This package of six boxes of forty eight bags per box is listed in the area of large tea bags suitable for making a gallon at a time of tea.  In fact it is just small single use bags.  The box and web page says ""family size"" bags.  There is nothing family sized about single use bags. This is a bad advertisement and you should not buy them.  Read these misleading ads carefully. I hope this company will go out of business."
5.0,Excellent snack bars!,"When I tasted my first Fiber One bar, the only thought running through my head was, ""why on earth didn't I buy more of these?""  These bars taste better than any high fiber bar out there.  I had to read and re-read the nutritional information.  There are 9 grams of fiber in each bar.  Imagine eating something REALLY good and good for you.  I can't say that about too many food items.  But, I gladly recommend this product.  Every flavor has an outstanding taste.  Even my three year old loves them.  Need I say anything more?"
5.0,"I just love it, and it saves me money","I can find this in any grocery store around where I live, but at 5-6 dollars for a 15 oz jar. This is 12, 15 oz cans for $2 each plus shipping. As far as hot goes it's just right for me and most people. I'm in, I'm there, this is the best deal I have found on Amamzon in a long time, and I have found a lot of them."
1.0,these are just gross,just plain GROSS!  They taste a little chewy and had a weird smell.
1.0,Lies,"Should not be labeled ""Key Lime Juice"" because it doesn't have Key Limes in it.  The actual labeling on the product is correct:  ""Key West Lime Juice"", meaning lime juice from Key West.  But if you are looking for juice that comes from Key Limes, this is not it.  Change the description!"
5.0,Tasty (Apparently) and a Good Value," Blue Buffalo Canned Dog Food, Beef Sirloin  is good stuff! We mix in a quarter of the can with some dry dog food (Blue Buffalo Adult Dog Dry Food, Chicken and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag and our dog loves it. Because we get four meals out of a can, this is a pretty good value. The chicken flavored wet food is pretty good too."
1.0,Odd Taste,"Very thin consistency. About the same as corn syrup. But the REALLY bad thing is the shocking chemical taste! It's like sweet shampoo. I kid you not. It is THAT awful. I'd write it off as a bad experience if it was a 16 oz. bottle, but this is a half gallon of stuff you couldn't pay me to eat again."
1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTING!  Will NEVER order again,"I ordered this product - Lowry's Pork Rind - and received it promptly - within two days.  I have not been able to pop one bag!  They all stay flat - nothing works.  My microwave is not the problem as I cook lots of other things in it.  Looks to me that the product is not longer any good, by the comments.  They may have started out great, but it NO LONGER IS WORTH BUYING!"
5.0,Great Taste,Found this to be an excellent product for making cherry limeades to flavoring yogurt!  Have made this one of my pantry staples!
5.0,Great tasting natural sweetener with slow uptake for those who watch sugar levels.,"Since this product is from the agave plant, it is a safer choice for those who need to be careful with sugar levels in their blood. The taste is wonderful, I really don't know if we could distinguish the difference between a spoonful of this and a spoonful of regular sugar dissolved in water. The consistency is nice to use as a pancake syrup, or on toast if you have a sweet tooth. We use this exclusively as our sweetener of choice - not because we have to, but because we like to. All those fake sweeteners taste terrible. This stuff tastes great. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,My Favorite Sugar Alternative!,"I first used Smart Sugar about three or four years ago. I bought it at Raley's, which, unfortunately, has stopped carrying it, This is the only low-calorie sweetener that I can bear to use. It doesn't have a funny ""aftertaste"" that I usually sense in low-calorie alternatives. One of my FAVORITE things is that there is NO ASPARTAME! That stuff makes me physically ill. I have actually lost some weight using Smart Sugar instead of regular sugar. I hope it becomes available everywhere soon! I have only been able to get it from Amazon.com for quite a while, and, as of this post, they don't have it. I hope they haven't stopped stocking it as well!"
5.0,"Wow, great cheese and price",I use a lot of this Kraft cheese. Put it on almost anything. At the store you get half the cheese at almost the same price as Amazon. Great cheese and deal.
5.0,Amazingly good GF spaghetti,"This is the best gluten-free pasta I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot of them.  The spaghetti is pretty much the same as regular spaghetti.  It is not mushy, it doesn't stick together or fall apart, and it tastes great!!!  It's made in Italy where they know their pasta!  It's hard to believe it isn't the ""real"" thing."
1.0,WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY IN THE WORLD!!!,"THESE ARE THE WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!! THESE HAVE NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.....LIKE EATING PASTE.I DON'T KNOW WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANUFACTURING THIS HIGHLY INFERIOR CANDY PRODUCT,BUT I HOPE THEY GO OUT OF BUSINESS VERY SOON!!! THE BOSTON BRAND FRUIT SLICES YOU SEE ON AMAZON ARE FANTASTIC AND TASTE JUST THE WAY FRUIT SLICES CANDYB ARE SUPPOSED TO TASTE."
5.0,Getting our 20 month old to eat fruits and veggies,"Our 20 month old loves these pouches.  He will eat fruits and vegetables on his own, but we use this as a snack on the go, or for when he's grumpy and needs a healty treat.  We tell him its ""juice"" and he loves it.  Perfect size and amount.  Highly recommended."
5.0,"Looks nice, sturdy, works great!","I bought this item over the keurig brand carousel because it was taller and more narrow.  For such a great price I worried that it wouldn't be sturdy but it is.  It is well-made, spins smoothly, and is sturdy.  On top of that it looks very nice on the countertop.  A cute way to have a variety of k-cups at hand."
5.0,"Great Taste,Great Price,","Tried a box at BJ's Wholesale outlet. I wasn't sure about the product and you can return anything you don't like there. A $10 difference lower in price for the 80 count box as compared to Newmans or Green Mountain bold 80 count coffee. What a pleasant surprise. Great taste, rich flavor at small & medium setting. Who cares what the container looks like??? It tastes good and its much less expensive that comparitive brands. Most medium to full flavor coffee in the K cup or pod version are weaker when pushed to the Large setting.. This one is as well. Obviously the more water processed through a medium blend of coffee in a premeasured container the weaker it will be...Make two cups at medium setting and you should be happy."
5.0,Tried first bottle of OKF at Trader Joe's,"I've had a lot of stomach issues for about the last 10 years.  Last 5 considerably worsening each year. Daily nausea, excessive gas and constipation.  Overall generally not feeling well at all.  Our first trip to Trader Joe's (Health food grocery store) I saw this product and thought I'd try it.  Had exceptional relief for several  days.  It tastes awesome and I'm extremely picky about tastes.  So have been trying to see if I could find it less expensive and closer to me.  Hurray. Success!!!"
5.0,Really Good ...,One of the things I really appreciate about these (good sized) three ounce bags of veggie sticks is the following: Servings per container: 3 Calories per serving: 140  They taste great and a one ounce serving is generous. They really are a good snack and a good value.
5.0,Great tasting but confusing cost/size ratio...,"These are great tasting meat substitutes !! What isn't great is that a 20-ounce can costs $18.58.  A 50-ounce can costs 11.55 !!!  Something is really messed up in the comparative pricing.  Other than that, these are great.  I hate that we have to buy a 50-ounce can (which is way more than we need) in order to be financially prudent."
1.0,highway robbery,This vendor charges over double the market price.  Vote with your dollars/euros/whatever and kick people like this out of the market.
5.0,MY FAVORITE ACAI JUICE!,"I don't know what the bad review is talking about.... I am a big fan of Acai Roots and I just LOVE all of their products! I know what a good Acai juice tastes like and comparing theirs with the other brands, they definitely have the best taste and there is no other juice added like he said. They are the real thing!! I used to buy them at Costco and I'm happy I found it here at Amazon! BEST ACAI JUICE IN THE MARKET!!!"
5.0,Blue Agave,"Very pleased, taste great & like that it doesn't spike your blood sugar as other sugars do.  We use in our coffee everyday, but many other uses for it besides that.  Also very good price."
5.0,delicious treat to eat,"I love oatmeal raisen cookies so when i heard that Quaker was selling a new soft baked cookie i was ready to try it. I was a little skeptical that it wouldn't live up to my expectations ,but Im glad i was wrong. It's so soft and yummy . it literally could have been a homemade cookie. its a great treat and i will definitely be buying more."
1.0,RECEIVED ONLY ONE BOTTLE -- TWICE,"BEWARE - I WAS SENT ONLY ONE BOTTLE FOR THE $14. I CONTACTED AMAZON, THEY SAID THEY WOULD CORRECT AND RE-SEND THE ORDER -- ONLY TO SEND ME A SINGLE BOTTLE AGAIN. ORDER NOW CANCELLED. NICE PRODUCT -- BUT WATCH OUT."
1.0,Purina should be ashamed for even putting this product on the market,"Just because a dog will eat something, doesn't mean it should.  I think Purina should be ashamed for putting this product out there, but I think they obviously only care about making a buck, not the health of animals and what their product might do to them. Looking at this bag and the ingredients made me angry.  The bag shows big chunks of beef, carrots, peas, etc.  What are the first three ingredients though?  In order they are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. Followed by whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved, rice flour, beef, soy flour, and it goes on with more digusting ingredients that don't belong in dog food including sugar and artifical colors.  I won't feed this filler/junk food to my dogs, they deserve better."
5.0,Awesome,This is a family and friends favorite. We have tried almost all of the different flavors and this one is great. the price of it here will make it easier to keep in stock in the home!
1.0,I really wanted to like these,"Bought these for dd for daycare without seeing it had peanut butter ( my mistake and not impacting review). I tried these. The taste is a bit off. Jelly tastes a bit off and there I really no nutrition. I am tired of seeing organic snacks with sugar as highest number in nutrition description. Going to have to make time and cook myself more. Too bad, as continence of something nutritious would be nice..."
5.0,Healthy Convenience,"I took these on our recent vacation and they were so handy while we were stuck in the airport.  It is nice to have something healthful to eat while surrounded by processed food options.  They are super filling and delicious.  If you haven't tried them yet, it is called granola but it is really shaped into bars which I think makes it easier to eat."
5.0,TASTE EXACTLY LIKE MCDONALD'S COOKIES!!!,These Newton Fruit Thins in Cranberry Citrus Oat flavor taste just like the McDonaldland cookies I used to eat in the 70's! I love these!!!
1.0,Marzipan Tastes Bland and Contains Sorbitol,"Normally I buy almond paste, not prepared marzipan, but thought that just this once I could save a little time. There is no one to blame but myself for not reading the ingedient list before buying. This is what happens when you rush. By now I should know that when it comes to even old stand-by products, nothing can be taken for granted.  The ingredient list begins as expected, sugar, blanched almonds, water but then it veers off into new frontier - sorbitol -- then corn syrup and potassium sorbate finish the list. Potassium sorbate is used as a preservative to extend shelf-life, and perhaps is necessary, but why is sorbitol added to something as straightforward as marzipan? If this wasn't enough, the marzipan does not have a good almond flavor -- it is incredibly bland.  Ironically, and a bit off the subject, I just read a book about dental health that discussed how damaging sorbitol is to the teeth and gums even though it is a popular sweetener in sugar-free gums and mints. The dentist who wrote the book stated that the bad bacteria in the mouth actually adapt to sorbitol quickly and begins to feed on it with greater frenzy than pure sugar.  Whether the dental issue is of concern, sorbitol is widely known to cause intestinal distress in some people, and people with irritable bowel syndrome limit or completely avoid the product. Bottom line is that sorbitol isn't usually found in marzipan and unless this ingredient is specifically desired by the purchaser, I'd steer clear for that reason alone.  I cook and bake in order to avoid additives, so this marzipan is particularly unacceptable for my use. Tallying up the plusses and minuses we have on the plus side, it is the correct texture for shaping and rolling out. On the minus side -- it is incredibly bland and is chemically enhanced with an artificial sweetener. Never again."
5.0,Love these rubs!!!!,"I was fortunate to have received a free sample of these rubs and we love them! They're great for grilling with chicken, burgers, steak and anything else you like to add flavor to. The containers are large enough to last you for a while and I will definitely be ordering more once we run out. Thank you BBQ Bros Rubs for my free samples and I recommend your product to everyone!"
5.0,boooyah,"These sardines are fantastic - probably why they stopped offering them. Actually, they spoiled me from regular sardines; after you eat these, the skin and tails and bones of regular sardines tend to make you quesy.  These have a mild flavor, so even if you don't like sardines, you may changer your opinion after these...  I eat them, one tin per day, at work - much to the dismay of my co workers.  Then I crumble some whole wheat crackers and spices into the fish oil and olive oil left over, let it absorb, and chug it down! Omega-3 fatty oils, protien, and olive oil! You cannot go wrong, and here in Butler (30 miles N. of Pittsburgh) Giant Eagle charges 2.99 per tin...so you save as well.  Eat. Get Healthy. Annoy your weak-stomache co-workers (smak your lips, smile, sigh as you eat). Can you go wrong? I think not."
5.0,Really great for baking,"For me, the only use for this is baking or making chocolate sauces out of it.  It's just too bitter to eat plain and it doesn't really taste much until your mouth melts it.  That is, if you chew it up, it's pretty much tasteless until it melts in your mouth.  At that point, however, it's just too bitter for me.  I made a chocolate sauce with cream and a little sugar and it was wonderful over ice cream, and even just plain (the little bit of sugar cuts the bitterness a lot).  By the way, be prepared to chop the pieces.  As is, they are a little large for anything, unless you're just going to melt them in a double boiler."
5.0,Tastes Great,I add this to sugarfree cappuchino and it tastes great.  It tastes just like the brands in the gas stations when I get a cappuccino there.
5.0,yummo,great product - absolutely delicious- tastes so much like desert but mostly protein! how great is that!
5.0,Good quality cat food at budget friendly price,"I can't say enough about Felidae. It's my favorite budget friendly quality cat food. There are better brands, that's for sure, but they will also help break the bank. Good quality ingredients- no by products, corn, or wheat. High protien. Cranberries for urinary health. The targeted urinary ph for this food is 6.0 which is perfect. These people care about their product and the animals that eat it. This is a good food and you can feel good about feeding it to your cat. :)Good health starts with quality food, and prevents expensive vet bills!"
1.0,BAD STUFF,This chili gives vegetarian a bad name and its not because it has no salt added.  This stuff just taste bad.
1.0,so disappointed,"its first time write a review,ordered 5 boxes of them (120 packages), expiration till Jan.7 2012 only,and its not returnable. so disappointed."
1.0,What happened to the taste?,"I was a fan of Senseo coffee for many many years. It is a fourth coffee machine in my house, many of my friends bought senseo coffee machine on my recommendation. I loved senseo medium roast coffee for the taste, which was very similar with Starbucks latte, my favorite. What happened? I bought 6 packs of Senseo Medium Roast, and it tastes very strange. Like old, cheap and poorly preserved coffee. Unfortunately, I already scheduled next delivery of 6 packs (I drink a lot of coffee). What is I am going to do, is to cancel next schedule and go to internet to find another good coffee company."
1.0,"DON""T BUY NATURA PRODUCTS FOR DOGS AND CATS***CAUSING HEATH PROBLEMS***","I put my cat on Evo for 2 years, she got a urinary tract infection.I had to change her food. Right after I changed her food. I found out Evo is terrible for animals, the food is causing alot of health problems and death.I got a letter in the mail stating there is a lawsuit against Innova Evo plus all Natura products.I'm currently in the lawsuit myself.. Evo lied about the ingredients in all their products...DO NOT BUY EVO AND NATURA PRODUCTS!!! (such as Innova Evo, California Natural, Healthwise, Mother Nature, and Karma Dog)Google it, it's called PetproductsSettlement.com.. It's for a $2,150,000 settlement"
1.0,so sad about this one,"We loved the Hodgson Mill 9 grain and honey wheat breads but I hope I just got a bad box in the case of the Jalapeno Cornbread I ordered.  There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap.  No Jalapeno flavor.  I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked.  I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake."
5.0,Strong stuff!,Arrived in a sealed bag and when used it was clearly a stronger variety than one gets in pet stores.  Cats have been stoned since.
5.0,Delicious!,"My boyfriend and I recently moved to the US and were very disappointed by the American style chorizo (yuck!). We decided to try ordering some stuff online and wow this product is probably one my best purchases ever! At first we bought three sausages - then once they were gone we bought five that we are currently working our way through. This product is the real stuff: it has wonderful taste (smoked paprika yuuum...) and just the right firm texture. Do buy the hot version though - don't worry, it's not very hot :-)"
5.0,Addicting,"I bought these thinking that two pounds would last us a month.  Try 3 days.  They pack some punch but won't rip your nose off with evey bite, and the peaqnut/wasabi flavor mix is great."
5.0,Great candy!,"I ordered these for my husband as part of his Christmas gift. He's always complaining that he can't find sugar-free black licorice. He absolutely loves them, says they taste like the ""real thing"". Very fast shipping."
5.0,Great Shortbread Cookies,"If you like the flavor of lime, you'll love these cookies. Not too sweet and the scent of lime makes your mouth water. It is hard to limit myself to consume only one package a day."
5.0,Love this mix - great price too,"This is a great mix and very convenient.  Makes great cookies in a hurry, especially when I am out of the base ingredients.  Buying 6 boxes on Amazon is much cheaper than buying in the grocery store.  The only downside is that I eat more cookies when I always have the mix on-hand."
1.0,Ants don't seem to like it,"The ants I got in my apartment don't seem to be interested in the bait, I've not seen a single one entering the trap and I watched them for a while & multiple times."
1.0,Dog likes it but after reading the label I don't,"My bad - I got sucked in by the Chef Michael name. I know he is a famous chef so I thought he would have the integrity to only sell his name to a high quality product line. After reading the ingredient list I'm not so sure. Too much soy, not enough protein. Plus all the low quality by-products in it, I'm not going to let my dog eat anymore. Sure my dog loved it but I love him too much to feed him garbage."
1.0,Skip it!,"Ordered these because I was super excited for new flavor. HUGE disappointment! Absolutely no candy corn flavor. The price is outrageous, I thought I was ordering at least a box with four packages of cookies. Save your money, or if you really want to try them, go to Target, they are available, exclusively, there."
5.0,Great any time of year!,"The taste of Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa is so good, it's hard to resist. But, since it's such a good source of calcium, we have the perfect excuse to enjoy it, anyway! Not only is it good mixed as per the package directions, it's fabulous added to a mug of hot coffee -- every bit as good as the expensive coffe beverages at Star*****!!  The 60-pack box is a bargain, and I promise you it's never gone stale in my house. Take it to work or school -- yummm!!"

5.0,Best K-Cup coffee I have had so far,Caribou coffee is the next best thing to roasting the coffee beans yourself.  I highly recommend caribou coffee when using the keurig machine.
5.0,Inka Corn...food of the GODS!,"If you like CORN NUTS you'll LOVE INKA CORN! And once you tried it, you won't want to settle of Corn Nuts again. I wish this snack was easier to find in grocery and convenience stores. But at least you can buy it on line now."
1.0,Worst coffee ever,This is the worst coffee I have ever smelled and tasted.  It doesn't have a good aroma.  It smells and tastes like it has a strange chemical in it.  It doesn't smell anything like most gourmet coffees.  It definitely didn't have the butter rum smell or flavor that would be expected given that it was labeled as Butter Rum Creme.  Save your money.  Buy a different brand.
1.0,So so,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese.  It is just so so in taste.  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese.  The cost does not justify the ordering.  I will not be ordering from Amazon again.  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain.
5.0,5 Stars...but read on...,"I gave this product 5 Stars because well...it's awesome. The value was incredible, and the variety was superb.  My only gripe...if you even want to call it that...is that this is advertised as Crazy Cups 70-Pack that comes in those pretty display boxes. I know the difference between these, because I ordered this 70-Pack not to long ago for about $10 more!  That's pretty much why I gave it 5 Stars. I got 70 awesome K-Cups as advertised, they just happen to be thrown into a USPS flat-rate box of sorts. I can assure you though there was not ONE K-Cup damaged, and I'm enjoying the hell out of these. So again, 5-Stars all around, just be aware you probably won't get them in those 2 display boxes, and that could really piss you off if you happen to be gifting these to somebody, MAYBE?  Personally? I'll be buying again for sure."
1.0,False advertising.,"This is not zero calorie nor actually sweetened with stevia! This is sweetened with a sugar alcohol, with a little stevia added. Each can has 50 calories and for a diabetic this stuff raises your blood sugar almost as bad as any regular sweetened with sugar soda. And the sugar alcohol gives you horrible gas. A big thumbs down to their false advertising."
1.0,Not too good,Was looking forward to this item. Like chickpeas but found these to be kind of spongy and not very good tasting. Will not purchase it again.
5.0,Great product,"I agree with the 5-star reviews for this product.  These noodles are excellent tasting, have a good texture and cook up very quickly (4 to 5 min in boiling water).  I have not really bought many soba noodles in the past, so I'm not sure how these US-made noodles compare to authentic Asian soba.  It is easy to saute some veggies and make a quick sauce (or use a purchased sauce), for a weeknight meal.  I often cook the whole box then divide in half, making 1/2 as a hot stir-fry dinner and then save the other 1/2 (plain noodles) to use the next day.  I put the left-over noodles in the microwave for a brief time (just to bring them to room temp) then assemble the salad.  Amazingly, the noodles taste fresh and good the next day, possibly better tasting than freshly cooked.  I'm sure they would make a great noodle soup, although I have not tried yet.  Ingredients are unbleached enriched wheat flour, buckwheat flour, water, egg whites, salt.  They seem pretty healthy and have a decent amount of fiber, although they are probably not as healthy as a 100% whole wheat pasta, for example.  For the 12 oz box, 6 servings/box, amounts per serving: 200 cal (10 from fat), 3g fiber, 390mg sodium, 8g protein, 10% iron.  Also, great price from Amazon."
5.0,I love this gum!,"My local stores no longer carry this flavor gum. Sad. It is one of the few pleasant-tasting sugarless chewing gums you can still find. Americans have developed such a taste for obnoxious, exploding, over-flavored, ultra-sour or painfully hot gum flavors. Gum that makes a person's eyes water and their breath fill a room. Trident Wild Blueberry Twist is simply and pleasantly fruity, with a wonderful blueberry-pomegranate flavor that lasts a very long time. Nothing fancy or extreme about it."
5.0,Love it!,"This product is so much better than honey. Love it's light flavor, easy use, and perfect size."
1.0,Don't buy,"This is false advertising. It is one overpriced bottle, not a case as described in the listing. Don't buy it"
5.0,Not Just For Babies,"I first discovered this product while stocking the baby food aisle of my local Wal-Mart where I work. I'm always on the look-out for low fat, low carb products and this fits the bill. There are 12 foil wrapped Mum-Mums containing 2 crispy wafers each measuring 4 1/2 by 1 1/2 inches.A serving is two of these easy to open packets,just zip them open from top to bottom along the side. They dissolve easily in your mouth and are still sturdy enough to spread peanut butter between for a sandwich that even a toddler would love, or top with tuna or egg salad without getting soggy. Great as a salsa dipper.They are bland taste wise but they're made of rice and they're a healthy alternative."
1.0,the nadir of this company's products,"Ugh!  I sure had high hopes and I was bitterly disappointed.  These things were just nasty.  I LOVE their other products (""just the cheese"") but not these things.    I even heated them up as suggested but they didn't get better."
5.0,Great Organic Pasta,"This is a wonderful product ,  Naturally low in fat no saturated and a multible use product.  Can be used just with butter or sauce or used as a add in for soup and other product. These work well with some knorr products."
5.0,Herb-Ox Vegetable Bouillon Cubes,"Excellent! I use it in soups, mashed potatoes, lentils, beans, etc.  It makes everything taste so good and it provides just the right amount of salt.  I don't have to add anything else."
5.0,Fantastic little things!,I use them for decorating cookies. They are wonderful. I can't say enough about the ease of use and perfect results. The fine tip makes decorating very small pieces easier than using icing.
1.0,UGH!!!!,"After recently finding out I have a wheat (or gluten)intolerance, I am having to give up everything I like to eat and/or finding gluten-free substitues.  In my journey I have run across these granola bars and I must say, ""Wow!  Those really SUCK!"".  I mean, come on.  If you can't make something taste good with peanut butter than don't even try.  They are truly terrible and the person who titled their review ""inedible"" had it pretty much correct.  If you are already on a gluten free diet and are use to tasteless food items that seem to be made out of sawdust then you might agree with the people who liked them.  There has to be better out there."
1.0,I GOT A WILD HARE,"...and bought these as an add on item for an inexpensive price. Unless you take into account that I bought three bags, opened one and tried it, then threw them all out. Not recommended."
1.0,19 Grams of sugar!!! Wash it down with a coke why don't you,"Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar. While oatmeal is healthy for you, Quaker dumps a ton of sugar in to these things to make them palatable. 19g of sugar to be exact. A can of coke has 39g of sugar! Yuck, if you are looking for a high nutrition, healthy, low calorie food, look elsewhere. Over half of the calories in this come from added sugar."
1.0,Stride uber YUCK gum!,"I ordered this gum after typing in stride ORIGINAL uber bubble gum, and the picture shows the original packaging, but when i received the order i was unexepectedly stuck with 30 packs of the NEW uber bubble which is DISGUSTING! So now i wasted my money and im stuck with all this junk!"
5.0,FABULOUS!!!!,"My Mini Dachshund has food allergies and I fed her Natural Choice, Lamb Meal and Rice, Dry, for the first 4 years of her life until I read [...].  Since then, I have tried my Mini Dachshund and Jack Russell Terrier on Canidae, Lamb Meal and Rice, Dry.  They weren't thrilled with the taste so I mixed it with some of the remaining Natural Choice.  That bag is empty so I am trying Newman's Own Adult Dog Chicken Formula, Dry.  I purchased the 4 lb. bag to see if my dogs liked it.  They were trying to get into the bag before I opened it.  They are crazy about the taste and I have never seen them gobble up the food so quickly.  I will purchase the 25 lb. bag next time.  It may be more expensive than other brands but it is good for their health and yummy, too!!!!"
5.0,Great! But the price?,These these are soooo YUMMY! I first had them on a JetBlue flight and ordered a case when I got home. But why are the Kettle Corn ones more than the others? Its just not fair! I haven't had the other flavors but I'm pretty sure this is the best.
1.0,One star because it doesn't tell you it is for Ethnic hair.,"When I got the product I didn't see any instructions, there is a pull up tab and it says massage into hair and scalp..huh? Well for how long do I leave it and how much do I use.  My hair is rather a disaster right now. I get bronchitis bad about 2 times a year and end up in the hospital on high steroids, then I loose about 1/4 of my over hair a few months later. This just started a few years ago, first It went totally curly and I have straight hair, had that for a year, then some fell out...the curls and straight came back my normal. This time is really bad, it is frizzy and slight wave to it. Nothing helps it, I have fine thin hair all my life now it looks like a ton of hair but horrid.  So I cannot give a true review on a product not for me. I called the number on the bottle which is wrong you get MCI tele network. So I found the website and no number there but video's and sure enough this is for Ethnic hair not caucasian hair like mine. There should be clear information on who the product is for."
1.0,NEVER AGAIN,"I thought that I would try the noodles to help me on my HCG Diet. Not only do they stink, they are hard to swallow. The texture is disgusting. It seemed as though no matter what I but on the noodles to try and make them better, nothing worked. And if you try to contact someone about the noodles, NO ONE GETS BACK WITH YOU. So by that, I feel the seller has horrible customer service."
5.0,Great convenience product!,"Well, was this ever a nice surprise! A bitty squirt, and I DO mean bitty, into a glass of water and voila!  Instant peach iced tea!  The flavor is quite nice, sweetened but not so much so that it gags you, and the peach flavor is quite present but not overpowering.  It is very refreshing, just awesome actually. One of those products you literally stumble upon and see yourself using it the rest of your life.  Kids love it too so that's the ultimate test in my book!  It's best with ice cubes though - the flavor kinda grabs you otherwise.  You don't need much - just a bit of a squirt into an 8-ounce glass of water and you're done.  The package will last for about 10-12 glasses of good tea, which isn't too bad and it doesn't need refrigerated after opening.  You need to use it within 30 days, however, after opening.  Great product, a great idea and a very fast pick-me-up at work.  Highly, highly recommend!"
5.0,good product for energy,It helped me to curb my appetite and lose weight while I am having full energy.
1.0,A box of broken bag cereal,"I ordered the pack of 10 from Amazon because we love this cereal.  It is organic and tastes good.  However, we found a box of cereal with broken bag.  I did not think much because I thought the box was sealed.  However, it was not only dry but had very strange chemical taste.  I immediately stop eating.  I contacted Cascadian Farm manufacture and they said they will send another box to me about 21 business days....I will not buy their product again...it is very not safe and very bad customer service."
1.0,Misrepresentation of product,"The one-star rating is for the company, not the product.  As was a previous reviewer, I too was misled in thinking I was going to receive the meal replacement, but instead received the meal supplement.  These are two totally different products.  I should've listen to person who reviewed this previously, but I was thinking that maybe that was a one-time mistake as no one else seemed to have the problem...WRONG!  This misrepresentation really needs to be corrected!  If you are looking for the meal REPLACEMENT, order elsewhere."
1.0,"Agree with ""basted not wrapped""","Like others, I ordered this product after Petsmart stopped carrying it. I ordered 3 packages a month or so ago and the treats were fine, my dog LOVED them like always! When I went to re-order, I read the review about the treats now being ""basted"" with duck flavor instead of being wrapped with dried duck pieces and thought it was weird, because my order was the same. That is, until I received this last order of 4 packs this week. All of them were basted or really more like stained in duck flavor -- my dog, who was usually so excited to get one of these treats, left it on the floor untouched. We are both VERY disappointed -- not at Amazon, but at the manufacturer for changing their product"
5.0,The best ESE coffee pod from the sample,Excellent coffee. This was my absolute favorite ESE espresso coffee pod from the sample of about 30 different providers and blends.
1.0,Folgers Does It Better!,"I thought that this new invention was genius...a brew that can be made using coffee in something that looks like a tea bag. I had tried Folgers Coffee Singles and all I needed was one bag instead of two, like I do with this product. The flavor was also actually really good for being Folgers. I saw Maxwell House Coffee Singles at Big Lots and bought two boxes...at $2.50 it was a bargain because Folgers goes for $6.00 at CVS.  Boy was I disappointed! This brew actually tastes woody and old. The coffee is also weak and possibly requires three bags to make a decent strong cup. Can't wait to go through these two boxes and never buy it again. Nescafe Clasico actually does a better job at a cup of joe. If you like a cup of brownish water then this product is for you."
1.0,Be Very Careful,"After I tasted a bottle of Ocean Spray Cranbery product that was labeled ""100% juice' in big letters and the word ""cranberry"" underneath I realized that it was way too sweet to be 100% cranberry juice.  When I finally looked at the tiny dark red strip at the bottom of the label, I found that it was combined with grape, apple, and other juices.  I called the 1-800 customer info line and asked if I could order the 100% cranberry juice from the website, the customer service representative told me that Ocean Spray doesn't make that product.  When I asked for the percentage of cranberry juicr in the product, she said that she did not have that information.  When I asked where I could find out, she said she didn't know.  Truth in advertising?  Their commercials show funny men standing in cranberry bogs.  Give me a break.  And if you are needing the cranberry juice for your health, be VERY careful."
1.0,Oo-long or Oo-short,"I usually do not bother to write any reviews as I think there are enough reviews already that one more makes little difference. Not in this case. I do not know what the people who wrote about this tea before me drunk or smoked (e.g. Kasia S., et al). I wasted hard earned $16 on something that even does not taste like a regular cheap washed out tea bags one can buy at any no-frills grocery store. If you never had a real Oolong Tea (like Pete's Phoenix Mountain Oolong) you may be fooled into believing that Oolong Tea tastes like this product. I think it sucks big time and I think potential victims should know the truth about it. This is how I use reviews for other products on Amazon to get an honest assessment of something I am thinking of buying. I am giving away all 5 boxes of this tea to people I do not know as shipping it back would waste additional time I do not want to donate."
1.0,"Maybe I got a bad batch, but this is terrible.","I've seen reviews where people compare it to Crystal Pepsi. In that it has a recognizable taste of Pepsi.  I don't get that at all. Every bottle I try and have friends try, it tastes like how toilet cleaner smells. It seriously tastes like ""green"" scented cleaning chemicals. I really hope I got a bad batch. For about $2 a bottle, this was absolutely terrible. I wish I could get a refund, or a reshipment if this is not what its supposed to taste like."
5.0,Stacy's Simply Naked Chips...Simply Sensational!,"We have ordered Stacy's Pita Chips many times before for our plane owners, who have very exacting taste in their favorite snacks.  They love Stacy's, so we order it often.  We can always count on the product to arrive exactly on the date specified, and in perfect condition."
5.0,"Kentucky Kernal, Flour Seasoned, 10-Ounce (12 Pack)","Kentucky Kernal, Flour Seasoned, 10-Ounce (12 Pack)  Fried chicken turned out really good. Will buy again."
1.0,dented can,"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 corns were dented"
1.0,Please Improve!,"I have been savoring Tony Packo's since 1968.  The Hungarian Hot Dog they serve is phenomenal! And the Chicken Paprikash (Csirke Paprikas) is excellent!  Unfortunately, this 7.5 ounce canned sauce is thin and contains a whopping  56 grams of fat (2 tablespoons is the serving size)!  I used a strainer spoon to separate out some beef. Only buy the canned stuff if you're desperate.  I had to scoop out a thick layer of fat before heating. Unfortunately, the frozen sauce is no longer available.  The dogs served at the restaurant (2 per order with a side of Pickles & Peppers) are easily edible without a fork and have the perfect combination of  mustard, thick rich sauce and onion. The place is a well maintained institution since 1932 with friendly staff and should be on your list of places to go while in the Toledo Ohio area. See their website for details. http://www.tonypackos.com"
1.0,Quality Control Problems - Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline Included,"As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident. Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks. I was dead wrong.  After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.  About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets. This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below. Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill. I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.  The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.  Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning  Event..........Date..........Time Order from Amazon..............................2/11/2011 Package Arrived ..................................2/16/2011 Discard of inflated (decomposed)sticks...~3/12/2011 Ate three Ostrich sticks.........................3/19/2011...7:00 PM Initial heart burn.................................3/19/2011...9:15 PM Illness begins......................................3/19/2011...11:00 PM Full blown food poisoning symptoms......3/20/2011...1:00 AM Full recovery.......................................3/22/2011"
1.0,Rancid oil smell,"Avoderm has always been near the top of quality dog foods, but what a smell that came out of that bag of dog food...had to throw it away..do not buy until seller chimes in that they have a new batch"
1.0,Streit's chicken soup mix,I did not not like Streit's chicken soup mix.....It did not have the good taste of Carmel Chicken soup mix......
1.0,Pricing,"I was shocked to see that these are selling for over $15 on Amazon.  My local grocery store carries this exact same product for $8.99!  The product itself gets 20 stars because my Beagles literally dance for them... but the pricing gets a big BOO!  I always shop Amazon because I know I can get terrific prices, that's why I was surprised."
1.0,NO Criiter Ridder !!!,I found this product to be totally INEFFECTIVE in regards to my woodchuck/groundhog problem.  The woodchuck walked right through the barrier ( which I had spread thick and wide ) with no hesitation.  I was very disappointed in this Havahart product.
1.0,Seriously???,"Sorry, but I really don't get all the great reviews.  I have been drinking green tea for more than 20 years and this tastes nothing like good quality green tea to me.  I admit, the smell is quite nice right when you open up the packet.  But once you steep it, all the taste and aroma goes away.  I had to force myself to drink this on three separate occasions just to make sure my taste buds didn't just have an off day or something.  I seriously can't drink this flavorless ""tea"" anymore and am throwing the rest away.  Good thing it wasn't very expensive.  If there's a Asian grocery store in your area, try out as many brands as you can to get a good sense of good and bad green tea.  I like My Green Tea a lot.  But I don't think they're readily available in most places."
5.0,just like grandmas,"I just love the oatmeal raisein cookie it was super soft and delicious, i was amazed by the amount of raisens in it because there usually isnt enough in other brands. Not only did i love this cookie but my daughter loved it so much i had to go out and buy a box of them. Id def. reccomend these to any cookie lover, im a fan for life."
1.0,NOT AS PICTURED BEWARE,You get two small bones in a package NOT the large one show I have 2 15 lb dogs who ate them like candy in 5 minutes expected a LARGE single bone to be chewed on for a while NOT a 8 dollar snack to eat BEWARE
1.0,Not so much,"I am a creole from New Orleans, I have eaten Pralines my entire life.  Im so very sorry to tell you that these sucked.  I only ordered them because I was given an amazon gift certificate.  They were not creamy and they tasted strange also they were way to nutty.  OK so this is my option, but I offered some to my coworkers and they hated them too.  Im sorry i think they are BAD.  i would like to have my money back."
1.0,NOT REALEMON BRAND!,"this is NOT ReaLemon brand. this is a generic product from Portion Pac Inc of Mason,OH. PPI does not sell RealLemon brand at all (PPI seems to be affiliated with H. J. Heinz)"
1.0,Does a cup of coffee have to be this difficult?,"I had high hopes for these coffee pods.  I typically use Senseo Columbian Coffee Pods in my Melitta single brewer and those were fine, but my grocery store stopped selling them, so I thought I would try these thinking there's more coffee and better beans in each pod so it must be better.  I popped one in my single pod holder and out came some hot light brown water.  Totally confused, I came and read some more Amazon reviews, and read that I should be wetting one side of the pod, placing it in the double pod holder, and pressing firmly in place to get it to brew properly.  I tried this method, and it did help, but it still tastes like water, so something must still not be right.  I'm open to suggestions."
5.0,more of a granola bar than a candy bar,"Of all the granola bars out there, I think this is probably the healthiest one I've tried. I keep one of these in my pack for a snack. It fills me up more than a candy bar and keeps me going longer. It's also my goto when I need a midnight snack. These are very crunchy, you really feel like you've had something to eat."
5.0,would like to eat it myself,"I got the blueberry and one other; the puppies love it. Both I and my wife love the smell of it. Wonderful ingredients. Not hard, but does not fall apart or even generate crumbs as the puppies chew it. Makes a gentle but very satisfying crunching noise (I like listening to my puppies crunch things). Easily one of the best puppy biscuits available."
5.0,"Love this, goodbye coffee",This is delicious and contains just the right amount of caffeine.  So easy to use and portable.  Best of all it doesn't bother my stomach like coffee - sems to be less acidic to me.  Can't wait to try the new flavors!
5.0,Actually does have some caffeine... but delicious just the same,"Just wanted to correct the earlier comment, as Green Jasmine Teas' Tea actually does have caffeine - 45 mg per 16.9-oz bottle.  I love this product - fresh tasting with a delicious aroma.  We need more unsweetened, tasty teas out there, but despite what innovation is to come, I expect this one will remain the pinnacle of its category.  Yum."
5.0,Found on Amazon!,Have not been able to find this in our grocery stores for about two years--so pleased to find here on Amazon!
1.0,coffee,"This illy issimo caffee coffee came from Amazon and I was certainly disappointed in the taste.  With all the coffes available on the market now this is the very last one I would choose if buying. illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) "
1.0,Not as pictured~!!,"What the picture shows is the Fun Dip triple pack that comes with 3 flavors and two sticks. This is NOT what was sent - I got single packs (one flavor, one stick). Too late to return as I need these for Halloween. CHANGE THE PICTURE AMAZON!"
5.0,Something Fishy,"well, this was mailed to Pretoria S Africa because they can not buy there and when last heard they were being rationed! With gusto and smiles! Wish this were available there. great flavor and fun in the mouth if one is lacking in pleasures, this is sure to please!"
5.0,YUM,I love this stuff!!!!!!!!!!  Share with all your friends !!!!!! watch the calories !!!!
5.0,My Favorite!!,This is an excellent crema coffee.  It is perfect for a great cuppa every morning and is my personal favorite.  Highly recommended!!
1.0,TASTE LIKE CRAP,"THIS LOLLIPOP DID NOT TASTE LIKE BACON.It was trash, Do not buy this.I bought this for a grandson he said it gaged him the taste was so bad"
5.0,TOP OF THE LINE,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND AN EASY WAY TO PURCHASE IT. MY DOG LOVES THIS TREAT AND IT'S GOOD FOR HER.
5.0,Organic meat,"We understand the need for orgainc foods. So, I was glad to try this brand of meat. We ordered these steaks for a holiday dinner and you can imagine how disappointed we were when they arrived at room temperature with no kind of coolant intact at all!!! What cooling agent there was, was long since spent. We are afraid to eat the meat.  I immediately called the organic meat company, and asked for a refund; left a message on voicemail.  I have not yet called Amazon cutomer service, but, will of the meat company does not make good on our order. Very annoying. If a company is going to send perishables, it should take care in doing it.  Follow up on this order. The owner returned my call and another order of properly shipped meat was deilvered to us. We cooked some of these steaks and they are superb. If you are a meat lover you owe it to yourself to try these steaks. DF"
1.0,Cheap eggs are cheap.,"These plastic eggs are terrible quality.  I bought them to use as centers for my classroom.  I don't expect they will last much wear and tear with students because the plastic is thin, the hinges are weak, and there are even holes in some of the eggs.  I would NOT buy this product again.  I would DEFINITELY not buy these eggs for Easter to put inside it--the eggs feel dirty and filmy and it would creep me out to put candy inside them.  There's a reason these are some of the most inexpensive--the quality is sub-par and disappointing."
5.0,my favorite coffee,"This stuff is awesome, perfect flavor and strength. gives you a wonderful foam on top, and is never bitter, actually gives you a nice size cup of coffee, unlike the lorenzo brand. I can't live without this T disc, on autodelivery!"
1.0,Poor Quality Dog Food!,"I was excited about feeding my Golden Retriever and Bichon this food since it is touted as being so healthy, but after reading the ingredients I realize that it is NOT so healthy.  Ground yellow corn is the first ingredient!  What about all the veggies on the front?  I prefer to feed my dogs food that has  meat as the first ingredient...real meat!  Dogs are carnivores and need some meat in their diet and not just ground corn , chicken by-product meal (whatever that is) and corn gluten meal.  Not for my dogs!  A very poor quality dog food."
1.0,not as discribed,these are not as described. These are not the cherry filled gum. This product taste terrible and are have no taste. Old and taste like cardboard.
5.0,So convenient,Arrived well packaged and just as described.  Also expiration date was not for another 6 months.  Can't beat the price either a lot cheaper than the grocery store.
5.0,Great sugar substitute!,"This is a great sugar substitute.  It has a slight molasses taste full strength, but you do not taste that when used as a sweetner.  It is much sweeter than sugar, so you do not have to use very much at a time.  It doesn't give you that sugar high or jitters and is absorbed into your system at a very slow rate.  I love it!"
5.0,Best Granola Around,"This is my third time purchasing Udi's Original.  It remains my favorite, with a wonderful balance of healthy ingredients.  I mix it in Stoneyfield no-fat unsweetened yogurt, and have it for breakfast.  It is sweet enough that it compensates for the blank yogurt, and makes a great meal.  I especially like th banana chips, and nuts.  Nothing in it is too hard for my sensitive teeth.  I've tried Udi's other flavors, which are good, but this is by far the best.  A great value too, when you purchase 6 bags."
1.0,Am I doing something wrong?,"I had to give this cat litter 1 star because of the HORRIBLE OVERPOWERING ammonia smell!  OMG!  I can barely clean it without wearing a face mask.  My whole condo smells of the strong cat urine it's horrible!  My eyes were watering and my nose was burning.  I cleaned out the box almost every single day.  Didn't have too many issues with the litter sticking to the box.  It does stick, but I got it all up pretty easily.  However, after just a few days the smell started.  In less than a week it was so bad I had to dump out the whole box.  This has happened 3 times now and I've tried adding other products such as baking soda and other cat deodorizers.  I haven't had problems with bugs, mice or anything like that.  Haven't noticed any dust.  The cats do track it everywhere all over the house.  I even found some in my bedroom down the hall this morning.  I have to vacuum pretty much every day.  If anyone has any advice for the horrible smell I would appreciate it!  I am just desperately trying to make it through the bag right now so I can move on to something else!  I am loving that I don't smell the poo at all, just the horrible urine which is now officially 100X worse!  I'd rather smell the poo again!  UGH!"
5.0,Great way to give medicine!,I have two dogs that require daily medicine.  This is such a great way to give them the medicine.  They love these pill pockets so much - they remind me when it is time for medicine!
1.0,Where did the REAL stuff go???,"If you like a hint of the past then this stuff is for you. All I can say is what a disappointment... The problem with these, Archer Farms and Kettle Valley are that all Fruit Leathers have become APPLE leathers with a smattering of the desired flavor in puree form. There used to be real pure fruit leathers made from the actual fruit (Apricot, Strawberry, etc) but for some reason they disappeared from the market about 10 years ago (last company I recall was 'Nature ...' something). I guess like everything else these days the emphesis is 'make it on the cheap' and forget the real quality.  It's a shame if it's merely a cost decision, there's a bonafide market out there for the real thing even if it's a little more expensive."
1.0,The pods is too large.,"Firstly, I can't use this coffee pods for my Francis Francis X1 espresso machine, because the pods are too large. Secondly, this item is not eligible for return. So, I have no idea how good this coffee would be, but ""No returns"" policy is just ridiculous.  My prior experience with ordering coffee on-line shows that the limitation on usage of coffee machine is always indicated. This is the first time it was not indicated, there were no product description saying ""unsuitable for Francis Francis XI espresso machine"" (or any other machine for that matter),   I am simply stuck with the coffee I can't  use,  and therefore this would be my first and last time ordering from Baronet Coffee."
1.0,Twinings - poor choice,"I'm a big fan of Lapsang Souchong tea; have been drinking it since LBJ was in office. That said, Twinings version is dreadful. The tea itself seems to be of low quality, and as one other reviewer suggested, the ""smoke"" seems to be out of a chemistry set, very artificial, burnt, and harsh tasting rather than a rich, smoky taste. Maybe they smoke it over discarded tires.   My favorite Lapsangs to date have been Wagner's loose (now out of business, apparently), and Numi's tea bags. Unfortunately, Numi discontinued their bags a while back, and for some reason, their loose tea doesn't seem the equal, which is pretty weird. Still, Numi is quite good, and far better than Twining's pathetic effort."
1.0,Way too strong,Even if you only leave the bag in for a few seconds the flavor is overpowering.  I like cup of herbal tea at night enjoying everything from Chamomeille to Peach.  I gave it away.
1.0,Spectacular Flavor - Watch for side-effects,"I really loved the Mio line.  Tried most of the flavors, liked most of them.  REALLY loved the Blueberry Lemonade.  Was great in water, but also in mixed drinks at Happy Hour.  Unfortunately, after about 5 months of regular use, I finally noticed a correlation between fits of explosive diarrhea and Mio usage.  I searched online, and I'm not alone. It seems to affect lots of folks this way.  Most seem to believe it's due to the Propylene Glycol in it... basically the same stuff that's in anti-freeze.  The body can't absorb it, and it's a slick oily-feeling liquid, so it triggers a very negative reaction in most.  Since many things in modern diets cause a similar reaction, it might go unnoticed for quite a while.  But when I stopped, the difference was amazing.  so... sorry Mio.  So good, but not worth the emergencies."
5.0,"Yummy, crunchy - and healthy too!","I love the Kay's Naturals Protein Chips - what a healthy way to satifsy cravings for crunchy snacks!  The Lemon-Herb are my favorite (and most crunchy), but the other flavors are excellent as well.  With 10g Protein per serving and reduced carbohydrates, you simply cannot go wrong..."
5.0,"Amazing, and easier to prepare than the above instructions...","There is nothing better than Ibarra hot chocolate! But all you really have to do is put two wedges of the chocolate, roughly chopped, into the blender with a cup of hot milk and frappe it. No simmering needed! (I nuke the milk.) Mmm, foamy and delicious!"
1.0,Rancid Batch,"We have loved this product until the last few days.  As I was playing w/my daughter who is 20 months, she said ""mommy tummy hurts"" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  ""...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans"".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now."
1.0,Worst meat snack I ever tried,"They taste more like chemicals than meat.  I like a lot of jerky and meat sticks, but would not eat these.  The dogs liked them though."
1.0,"Honestly, plain water does the trick","It's not terrible, but personally, I could not get past the color, and it did have a bit of a metallic aftertaste. I am going to stick to plain water. It is cheaper, refreshing and has all the nutrients my body needs."
5.0,Great for Lego Party,"I ordered these Lego-like candy from Amazon.com for my son's 9th Lego birthday party. What a treat. My son was so excited to have these because he could finally eat his creations.  He even helped decorate his own cake by putting these lovely blocks on it.  I ordered the 3lb bag and it was more than enough for the ""guess how many candy in the jar"" guessing game, as well as for the take home treat bags. The guests all loved being able to eat their towers.  I would certainly buy these again and I highly recommend them."
1.0,Not as advertised.,Ordered for Christmas dinner. Meat quality was not USDA prime.  I have bought select prime rib for half the price.  This was select quality not USDA prime.
5.0,A healthier pasta that also tastes good!,"Ronzoni Garden Delight Radiatore may be a more expensive pasta than others, but I think it's worth it.  Having a full serving of vegetables per 4 ounces of pasta makes it a healthier option than plain pasta.  Plus, the veggies add a bit of flavor to the pasta that changes things up a bit, in a good way.  I like the radiatore shape for macarroni and cheese.  It makes a good base, with lots of crevaces to fill with cheese.  It feels heartier, too.  You can taste the veggie powders used in this pasta.  To me, there is a flavor of mild tomato soup and mild vegetable broth, as though you've cooked the pasta in a concentrated vegetable broth.  I tastes pretty good, and actually makes the mac and cheese taste great!  Even my hubby liked it!  Along with the vegetables, you also get fiber and protein with the pasta.  There's a good amount of Vitamin A, which usually isn't in pasta.  Overall, I'd recommend at least trying Ronzoni Garden Delight in place of regular pasta in most any dish.  It adds a different flavor, but it isn't overpowering and blends into your meal.  Whether it's a hot or cold dish, using this radiatore in it makes it healthier and tasty.  OVERVIEW:  PROS: - good flavor, can taste mild vegetable flavors - cooks up well and easily - provides extra nutrition regular pasta doesn't  CONS: - more expensive than regular pasta"
5.0,Bill's Best is the Best!!!,"This is the BBQ sauce for health-conscious individuals! Not only does it taste delicious--almost like a Memphis style BBQ sauce--but it is made using the healthiest ingredients possible (without sacrificing taste). Every other organic or all-natural BBQ sauce on the market includes one or more of these less than healthy ingredients: corn syrup, gluten (wheat), and/or soy. Bill's Best is the only one I've seen that does not have any of these ingredients, yet it still manages to taste better than the others that do. Believe me, living in Tennessee for the past twelve years, and being surrounded by various types of BBQ restaurants, I have tried virtually every type of BBQ and BBQ sauce in an area of the country known for great BBQ. Bill's Best ranks right up there with the best of them! This is a must buy!"
1.0,no taste,Don't waste your money on these.  They have no taste at all.  I used them in a cookie recipe and not one person could tell me what flavor they were.  I gave them one star  because evidently a rating necessary.  It doesn't deserve one or any part of a star!
5.0,Fresh,Product stays in good condition because they're individually wrapped. Good if your kid likes bananas because they are wrapped with 4 pieces together. Good for lunch size.
5.0,Best Quality Green Tea - No Comparison!,"I'm not a huge fan of Tea (I'm a self-proclaimed coffee addict) so when I do drink Tea - I prefer only Green. No black tea, Milk Tea or any of the flavored Tea ... just Green!  The moment I was introduced to Numi Organic I'd immediately recognized the difference! Rice Green is my absolute favorite and the only Tea I drink. I literally keep a tea bag in my purse at all times just in case I'm in the mood for a hot cup at a friend's house or at a restaurant. No other brand will do! Numi's Toasted Rice has a subtle flavor and it only gets better cup after cup. It's also the perfect Tea to accompany dessert (especially Chocolate) - the mild flavor of the Tea somehow enhances the flavor of the Chocolate! Mmmmmm!!!  I'm actually craving an afternoon cup right now!  Thanks for such an impressive product, Numi!"
5.0,Excellent Organic Green Tea,Newman's Own Organic Green Tea is delicious and perfect for those who choose organic products! Just a note for those of you who heat your water up in a microwave- you cannot put these tea bags in the water while microwaving as the bags have tiny metal staples in them.
1.0,Don't waste your money,"I bought this (not from Amazon, but just want to post a review to help)hoping to help out my 7-month old adopted lab puppy (who was kept outside and never housebroken at her last home) to pee outside. She was doing well without the post, but still has some accidents, so I wanted reinforcement to go outside.  Well, because I guess it smells like another dog, and she is totally a non-alpha dog and actually shy about intruding on other dogs' territory, it actually made her training go BACKWARDS. Now she is terrified to go in her ""spot"", and would rather go inside.  I hate this thing and am sending it back; I wouold give it 0 stars but they make me give at least 1. Maybe it would work with a more alpha dog, but beware if your dog is not."
5.0,"The best quality organic snack, with nothing added!","I love these snacks! They are so moist, full of flavor, fiber and no additional sugar or preservatives. Our kids love them too. We have to make sure to keep enough, otherwise they fight over them. Ideal snack to take to the movies,trips, and any place we go. This is a real ""feel good"" snack. We appreciate that's gluten free."
5.0,Sweet(er) than sugar,"As someone that has a major sweet tooth when it comes to coffee, Splenda is the first low-cal sugar substitute I have found that is as good, if not better than, sugar.  The packaging of that with antioxidants in this convenient package is perfect for the office or the kitchen."
5.0,Kiki loves it!,"I have a pretty finicky cat, but she LOVES to eat this food! Can't beat the price, and the pouch is much easier to deal with than the cans. She especially likes the juice, and the tiny pieces are easy for her to eat."
1.0,fancy feast,"I was happy with the prices when i started the subscription, but now you are more expensive than the grocery store and in my order at least 8 cans were dented like the boxes were thrown around....not at all happy."
1.0,Just pour it down the drain,"This is my first review ever after being a customer of Amazon for almost a decade.  I do it to save others from this awful product.  I too was so excited to try this new k-cup. With high hopes I placed it in my trusty Keurig and pressed the button.  This was without a doubt the most vile bitter tasting coffee I have ever had including the stuff they sell by the gallons in gas stations.  At first I could not believe it and brewed another cup as well as a cup of two other brands of k-cups, Starbucks and Green Mountain comparable dark roasts.  I tasted them all black and what a difference.  Even though these are cheaper save your money, do not buy this product."
1.0,Bad noodles,"I just tried theWylers Mrs Grass chicken noodle boxed soup,  and the noodles tasted like the cardboard box. Have the other box left and will chuck it!!! It does have a better flavor than Liptons boxed chicken soup tho'. Wish I could find a GOOD boxed soup!!!"
1.0,GF cinnamon buns,"Great that they are gluten free. Unfortunately, they are flavor free.  If you didn't add the butter or sugar as recommended they would be softened cardboard.  They do not turn out as pretty as the box cover.  Not very impressed."
1.0,Dog chewed through the jug itself,"I used it with my dog a couple dozen times, and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the ""ultimate solution"" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for ""heavy chewers"" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund."
1.0,OUCH,This stuff was like drinking battery acid.  Right after having about 1/3 bottle I had lunch and the food burned going down.  I had no increase in energy either.
1.0,it smells so bad I could not use this + THIS OIL IS NOT EVEN A BARGAIN!,"I ignored the other reviews for this oil, and purchased because I thought the price was good.  There were two things wrong. First, you will notice it says to put in hot water to melt the oil so you can get it out of the bottle.  This packaging is appropriate for warm weather locations.  Seattle is not a location that works for this product.  2.  The smell gagged me.  You do not want to put this product in your mouth.  I might use this on my hair, before washing it, but that is about it.  It stinks!  I have purchased other brands, from this website and from vitamin websites and they were cheap and lovely to the nose, mouth, and body.  I honestly do not know why this smells so bad. I have edited my review.  The reason I purchased this oil over others was that I thought that it was a bargain.  When I got the container I found that it was no cheaper and in fact more money than some oils I have been purchasing.  If you are using coconut oil for eating or putting on your body,  I urge you not to buy this oil.  It stinks really really bad, is no bargain and you cannot get it out of the container.  I should have returned it to amazon immediately upon receiving this."
1.0,Beware: 8 oz only!!!,"The weight of this product was not specified by the seller and the picture is too blurry to see the details. The product description says 10+ oz, but it's only shipping weight. The actual bottle you get is only 8 oz.  I was very disappointed when the product arrived and saw the tiny little bottle. Won't purchase this item again."
5.0,My dog loves these.,"After having 11 teeth pulled by the Vet, I had to find a convenient way to brush my dogs teeth.  I have used these for 6 months and he has not had any more teeth problems.  he loves the taste and he has fresh breath."
5.0,Pounce cat Treats,"This is the only treat my Red Persian will eat.  She is very large, and will eat everything in sight from the other cats in my home,  But this treat is the only one for her.  If I put out something else for the other cats, she will leave it alone, and wait for this one.  I'll be in Big trouble if this is ever discontinued."
5.0,Sweet indulgence,"This pocky flavor is really good. Its light and sweet and good for a tiny little snack. Pocky's are addicting because of the POP, crunchy sound it makes every time you bite into it."
5.0,Chicken soup light works wonders,"Living in a small apartment is difficult for an indoor cat that can't get much exercise. I was already using the regular Chicken Soup cat food for my kitty, but when she began to gain weight, I ordered the light food and found that her weight is maintained now in healthy proportions. Highly recommend!"
5.0,Oreo Versus the Girl Scouts of America,"If you are like me, chances are that you've eaten a lot of Girl Scout cookies over the years, and if you are like most GSA cookie buyers, your favorites are the famous  Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies .  If this is true, chances are you have found the occasional thin mint cookie that equaled them but not a thin mint cookie that bettered them,...  until now.  These  Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;mes , also available in  Oreo Regular Fudge Cr&egrave;mes ,  Oreo Mint Fudge Cr&egrave;mes , and  Oreo Golden Oreo Fudge Cr&egrave;mes , are IMHO BETTER tasting than the Girl Scout Thin Mint Cookies so while I might in future be persuaded to purchase fund raising thin mint cookies, they will be for other people.  I'll be eating these!  Note: As other reviewers have noted, this is not an entirely new concept for Oreo, which has offered limited editions of chocolate dipped whole sandwich cookies:  Oreo Mint Fudge Covered Chocolate Sandwich Cookies ,  Oreo Pure Milk Chocolate Covered Mint Sandwich Cookies , and  Oreo White Fudge Covered Chocolate Sandwich Cookies .  The trouble is that these are by definition limited editions that may not be available when you want to purchase them while the new fudge covered half cookies look to be a regular stock item available year round."
1.0,Sad,"This is by far my favorite gum.  I was excited until they turned out to be jaw breakers.  They must be old, hard as rocks:("
1.0,Want to drink pool water but don't want the chlorine? Get this,"No matter how much or how little of the product I put into my water (filtered or unfiltered), it always ends up smelling and tasting like chlorinated pool water. I'd heard good things about MiO, and I love peaches, so I thought I would try this. I'm regretting my decision."
5.0,MAKE YOUR DOG SMILE,"My dog seems to eat this food better than others.  Although, I must say I mix the Blue Buffalo with a handful of Benefeful (for the veggies) and half can of Alpo (for the gravy).  I feel BB has more protein and plan to buy more when this bag is used."
5.0,Great Tasting Product - Affordable Delivery with Amazon Prime,"I enjoy root beer, but don't care for the sugar content and have generally been displeased with the diet alternatives.  Hansen's Diet Creamy Root Beer is the exception.  The product has a full taste similar to that frosty and creamy root beer you may remember from the drive-in, and none of the after taste of other diet brands I have tried.  I am even able to enjoy the taste warm, though it is much better when served ice cold.  The shipping price is reasonable with Amazon Prime, overall slightly cheaper than the local retailers that carry it.  I highly recommend this product if you are a fan of root beer and looking for a diet alternative without compromising taste or quality."
1.0,Garbage in a vacuum packet,"Crown Prince needs to clean up its act because when you buy this product, you get more garbage than sardine. I found scales, sand and stuff I could not even identify. From that, there were two small sections of some kind of fish. Why the USDA even allows this into our country is beyond me. This is a horrible product. Fully recommend King Oscar brand."
1.0,delivery too much and too long,"The delivery of the product was more than the cost of the item. Which, I might have been ok with if it had not taken over 10 days to reach me!"
1.0,Not very Good,"I like to add a little Irish cream, like Bailey's to flavor my coffee, but did not want the alcohol, so I ordered this.  I found it to be awful.  It was bitter, and even adding cream could not hide the taste.  My wife said the same.  I've got 1 full plus 1 almost full boxes to go out with the garbage, I would not give this to a friend.  I now just add a little irish cream flavored Coffee Mate (found in large bottle at local restaurant supply house) and a small amount of chocolate syrup to Timothys Kona Blend.  Its much better but not great."
1.0,"Dogs cannot digest this, vet told me to stop","Our vet asked us to not give our dogs these because they cannot digest them. Whatever they are made of does not break down once eaten, made my dog sick and when I cleaned his potty I saw entire chunks on the treat. They claim the new formula is digestable, but it wasn't for our dog at least..."
5.0,"Makes a delicious, quick dinner","I have tried several of the Asian Home Gourmet spice packets, and so far I have been pleased with them all. The Korma curry was fantastic. You just saute onions with some oil and the spice packets. Add your chicken and stir until it is browned, add water and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Finish off with some coconut cream or yogurt. When I mix yogurt into this dish (or any curry dish) I mix a bit of flour in with the yogurt. That keeps it from curdling. Give it a try. It is a smooth, mild curry."
5.0,Excellent Vanilla Beans,"I bought these to make my own vanilla extract at home.  These arrived in a timely manner, vacuum sealed, and it smelled fantastic! The vanilla beans were super plump --no more going to the stores for vanilla beans.  Thanks!"
5.0,mixed drinks,This is a really great way to try new drinks without purchasing a large bottle and being dissappointed. Then you can get the large bottles of what you like.
1.0,Dog loved it Vet hates it,Feeding this every day made my dog sick accoding to the vet.  I had to throw my 1 year old yorkie's stockpile away.
1.0,"""Health food"" from China? Doubtful","This product is made in China.  I would not believe any claims they make regarding allergy safety and vegan/kosher.  Considering Mrs. May's markets itself as a healthy product, I was shocked when I glanced at the back and noticed this product was made in China. China has proven that we can not trust their manufacturing practices. Unsafe toys, dog food, and now we're supposed to trust them making our health food?  Not to mention the carbon footprint created by shipping something halfway around the world. I will not buy this product anymore."
5.0,spicy cruncy goodness,"these are fantastic!! spicy, crunchy... delicious!!  I also tried trader joes (good, but not enough seasoning for my taste). I tried a couple other japanese imports but these are still my favorite."
1.0,Horrible stuff but it's all the cat will eat!!,I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!
5.0,Saco Premium Baking Cocoa,"I've used this cocoa for several years. It gives a rich chocolaty  flavor that I really enjoy. I especially love it for my recipe of no-sugar-added cocoa/coffee drink mix I make as a morning wake up, but also in homemade chocolate pudding as well as in any baking that calls for Dutch processed cocoa or is unspecified. The Saco brand of cocoa is a bargain, as is their buttermilk powder mix."
5.0,Delicious!,"The noodles come out just right - soft but with enough tooth to keep them from becoming mushy.  It's not spicy-hot at all, despite the photo of hot chilis on the lid.  It's the well seasoned chicken broth that makes even the little bits of TVP masquerading as chicken more palatable.  This is a great bargain and a terrific in-a-pinch office lunch."
5.0,Havanese is a happy camper!,"We have had our little guy on Purina Pro Small breed since we got him as a 1 year old. We are having some issues with him in regards to weight. He was getting far less than the recommended amount, but still within what our vet thought was OK. This was the same food he had been on at his breeder. I was reading labels and have never been happy that the Purina had such a large % as corn.  We tried going with Orijen. That eliminated the objectionable grains, but doubled the protein %. He did not handle it well, even with a slow transition period. Stools changed to more greenish and became much larger, then eventually much less formed. He seemed happy to eat it, but apparently his GI tract did not agree. Back to reading labels.   I had used Wellness with cats before and had good response. Then I checked to see if it appeared on animal food recall lists during the 2007 rice gluten (melamine) scare - it was never recalled. The label guarantees no wheat, soy or corn. He transitioned amazingly well and is behaving very puppy-like. It will take months to see if this is going to be a good weight control choice, but in the mean time I feel better he is not getting any corn or soy."
5.0,cookie sprinkles,Fun candy sprinkles.  Generous supply to use on holiday cookies. There is a pour spout and a shaker opening as well. Adds to the holiday baking fun.
5.0,Parmesan cheese goes with everything,"This will never stand up to fresh grated Parmesan reggiano, but you wont find a better grated Parmesan cheese out there.  because my daughter adds it to so many things the 16 oz is the right size.  great value on amazon"
5.0,HOT HOT HOT,"I have looked for these little guys for awhile and this 5lb bag ROCKS as advertised!! I love them and the guys at work, the original reason I ordered them, can't get enough.  I'll be reordering soon!!  Weeeeeeeeeeeeeell worth the $$ for a 5lb bag!!"
1.0,disappointed,"These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack."
1.0,Not Invisible,"The deodorant is a white substance, goes on white, and white clumps remain hours later.  I'm very disappointed that this product specifically states ""invisible"".  This is NOT invisible and there is nothing on the packaging stating that it is white in color.  Unilever should be reprimanded for falsely representing this product on the packaging."
1.0,Stale,I have tried this granola localy and loved it. I saw the low price on Amazon a while back and bought a case. The stuff I got in the mail didnt taste at all like the granola I bought in the stores. It tasted like rancid powdered milk. After a mouthful I havent been able to eat This brand of granola again.
5.0,Tasty Tarts,"It seems like whenever I go to the grocery store, most or all of the pop tarts they have are the frosted type which are WAY TOO SWEET for my taste. These, unfrosted ones on the other hand, hit the spot. They are great for a quick breakfast on occasion, or a quick snack at any time    Just pop them in the toaster, and a couple minutes later, you have one of the quickest, easiest to prepare hot snacks known to mankind.  Oh what a tasty tart treat, to set before the King, or Queen."
5.0,Wonderful!,"The Lobster Bisque is absolutely delicious. Nice lobster flavor; I cannot imagine what you could possibly add to improve the taste of this soup. Just open, heat and enjoy. I've become such a fan of the Baxter's line that I can't wait to try them all."
1.0,Not the puppy food for us,"This did not work for our puppy.  It left her with quite the upset tummy.  It was the food she came home from the breeder on, but something must have changed when she got home.  We have since made the switch to eukanuba and she is a much happier pup!  Plus, I am happier too since I'm no longer cleaning up after her all the time!  As always, Amazon was great, but I would not recommend this food for your puppy."
5.0,It'll Cure Whatever Ails You,"The other reviewer's comments influenced my purchase for the GARLIC to chase the winter colds that may appear. Soups and entrees heavy on the onions and garlic are my family's cure all to get you well. I couldn't wait to this to arrive to try it out. It is very easy to make and will shoo away vampires, germs, ""too close for comfort"" friends and family dog. There are stove top and microwave (5-7 minute) directions included. It's quick, tasty and a WINNER on sale for about ONE buck a box (free shipping eligible).  Psst...I added mixed vegetables, it was liked by all NO LEFTOVERS!"
1.0,Old stock and not good - disappointed on ordering second time,"""Planters Dry Roasted Peanuts"" - when I first ordered they were good and crunchy and it disappeared from my house fast and so I ordered the second package and I really feel for ordering. The peanuts were old stock and did'nt taste good or cruncy. Disappointed with amazon, did not expect this from amazon.  Since all these S&S come in three packs, it is a waste of money. Better to get one from local stores atleast if it is not good, I will not waste lot of money like I do with amazon."
5.0,My Puppy LOVES these!,"I have a 6 month old Pomeranian, and he just LOVES these. They are also very handy, since he can only have small treats, and I don't have to break these up!"
5.0,So Convenient!,"I love Silk Very Vanilla Soymilk in the large cartons, and I was so happy when I was browsing through Amazon and came across these individual 8-ounce containers I just had to order them. The delivery was on time and I immediately put them in the fridge. They taste just like the large cartons sold in grocery stores and come in cute little containers. I will definitely re-order these!"
5.0,Very tasy,"I don't actually eat gluten free or diary free, but I loved these.  They weren't that sweet, actually pretty spicy and chock full of nuts and fruit.  They had a great texture as well.  Slightly chewy, but mostly soft.  I had one in the morning and it did a pretty good job of keeping me full for a while.  Nice wholesome ingredients as well.  I can't say I'd buy them considering I don't need the gluten-free and they are pricey, but they were very good."
5.0,Lifesaver of a product,"As a mom of a child with multiple food allergies, and as a peanut allergy sufferer myself, we LOVE this product.  I tried Sunbutter for the first time when I was on vacation with my hubby and we have consumed it happily since then.  When my son turned out to have tons of food allergies this became a wonderful staple to help keep good fats and protein in his diet without risking exposure to other things that could cause him to be sick.  Comes HIGHLY recommended.  My 2 year old asks for it EVERY day!"
1.0,Not Chocolate,"This did not taste like a chocolate bar at all. I can't describe how it tastes as I haven't encountered something like this before. I know that is is suppose to be better for you and it's all natural but honestly, I've had slim fast bars that tasted better than this. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for this as it went into the garbage."
5.0,Cafe Du Monde Coffee,We love this coffee.  We have it every time we go to New Orleans.  Now we can have it at home too.  It is great that we can buy it at Amazon.com.
1.0,STALE,"i have previously tried these from Whole Foods so i knew exactly what to expect.  however, when i opened the first bag, they were STALE, which made them taste bland and disgusting.  i have 23 more bags left... i'd be better off having real cardboard."
5.0,Keurig K-Cup Red 18 cup carousel,"Bought this for myself...love the red color and I love my Keurig coffeemaker!  Great service, great product, just as advertised.  Carousel so handy for storing."
1.0,RUINED SHIPMENT,"I ordered this product along with another brand of coconut oil and six CD's. I arrived home to find an oil soaked box sitting on top of my mail box (I was away from home 2 hrs during which the mail was delivered) ....the temp was almost 100 degrees.  I opened the box to find a huge mess!  The other brand oil was enclosed in a sealed plastic bag that was dry inside even though the oil itself was liquified....when I removed the lid, the seal on the top was completely intact.  This product, however, was put in the box loose.  The plastic jar seal was unbroken but the lid turned easily so I could clearly see how the liquified oil had come out and gotten all over the interior of the box.....including the six CD's....with oil seeping up into their plastic coverings and onto the paper jackets.  When I broke the plastic ""ring"" that is supposed to seal the outside of the jar, I found that the seal on the top was not secured to the top but had come loose so the oil came out and under the loose top.....since it wasn't in a bag, it went everywhere in the box.  This was a packaging DISASTER all around!!!!  I found this order didn't ""qualify"" for leaving feedback under the packaging feedback tab in the order category.......so I can only assume it is the seller's responsibility; and the inner seal does definitely need to be addressed by them.  The oil tastes fine but I certainly will never order again.  UPDATE:  I was gratified to find that Amazon reads these reviews and reacts to them....after posting this review, I received an email apologizing for my experience and advising that I would receive a replacement for the Barlean's.  I did receive the Barlean's which arrived with no problem; it was packed the same way but was sent two-day shipping so didn't sit in any heat for extended times....also, this jar didn't have the failed seal under the lid when I opened it.  I appreciate and was impressed by Amazon's response but, to be honest, I have to wonder if when regularly shipped it still wouldn't be a problem since it's not enclosed in a plastic bag inside the box and if sent via USPS in this heat is almost certainly going to melt."
1.0,Expensive!,Do yourself a favor and go to the nearest supermarket (or even deli) and get it for $1.50-$2.00. Paying over $3.00 for this water is a robbery.
1.0,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,I really hate this product and now don't know how to get rid of it. I apologize for not being able to explain how sickening this product tastes but it's truly gross!  Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!
5.0,Happy with my new Bonsai starter tree!,"I received my starter Bonsai tree today, and was pleasantly surprised. The Bonsai came well packaged, and tucked safely inside the box was a robust, healthy starter tree. It came with detailed care instructions too. The older Bonsai trees can be quite expensive, so I thought I would try this starter Bonsai, and I am glad that I did. I had fun shopping for a Bonsai pot to transplant it to. If you want to try growing and shaping your own Bonsai tree, then I recommend this little starter tree."
1.0,Ghastly,"Giving the other 17 bags of these to the local food shelf just seems too cruel, better to throw them away.  I don't know what good the 'popping' does except make them sort of hot. They're too salty, have a hideous flavor, taste nothing like pork rinds. They don't even taste as good as _bad_ pork rinds. They're also loaded with chemicals I want to avoid (probably part of the source of the hideous flavor)."
1.0,"""used to be great, dried fruit""","The first time I ordered the product, it was great and that is why I bought it again. This time, it seems to have been a BIG mistake. The fruit was humid, hard and nothing like before. Should not forget to mention the big clumps of fruit stuck together, that were so hard it made my teeth hurt. Too bad. I used to love this product, and talk to my friends about it. Not anymore. :("
5.0,Cookie Bites,I've had other Kay's Naturals in the past and have always enjoyed their products.  The honey almond cookie bites did not disappoint!  Just the right amount for a snack.
1.0,total crap,"The only reason this gets one star is because you have to give it atleast that much.  This is not anything like a K-cup.  It is instant coffee in a K-cup wrapper.  There is a supposed guarantee on the box but I have called the number many times and can never get anyone to call me back.  I usually won't bother trying to get my money back on this kind of thing but I have made an exception due to the horrid product.  In the company's defense, there are probably so many people calling to tell them about this wretched product, they may have not had time to get back to me."
1.0,$10 thrown away,"My dog destroyed the rubber ""cord"" in 5 minutes (worse yet, swallowed it), got very nervous trying to get the treats out and almost attacked my other dog for trying to get it from her (which she never before did). I had to take her toy away and wish i could get my money back. $10 is not a cheap tog toy, so it could be at least durable. I bought it because i thought it'd be a good distraction to keep her entertained and less anxious when i leave, but now i'm afraid it'd be inducing aggression and causing harm if ingested. And that would cost much more... Better stick to Kong toys, the only ones so far my chewing dog cannot destroy it!"
5.0,great stuff,Love it! I put it on most everything. From pizzas to spaghetti to eggs. There are at least 87 foods you can put this on. I ran out once... I dont plan on that happening again
1.0,It has sugar in it,"The only reason I purchased this product was to have a natural sweetener as a substitute for sugar. The ingredients did NOT list sugar (on Amazon page), but when I received the shipment I saw that sugar was one of the ingredients."
5.0,Great soup mix,"I have used this soup mix for years. I add 1# of cooked ground beef and the 8 ounces of tomato sauce suggested. I also often add either frozen green beans or okra for even more vegetables. Good last minute winter dinner idea, even for kids and/or company."
1.0,Ick.,"Candy had an orange flavor, but it wasn't a good one.  This was not the candy I expected it to be.  Won't buy it again."
5.0,France in my Pantry,I found this condiment on a recent trip to France.  It makes seafood shine and a ho-hum ham sandwich make you feel as if you are sitting in a cafe on the bank of the Seine.
5.0,ADDICTING,These cookies are almost too good... it's a shame there are only 9 in a box!  Probably one of the best gf cookies available.
1.0,Worthless Indoor Trap,"Ineffective and worthless. I bought this product for indoors and two other outdoor fly traps.  The outdoor traps worked immediately and I have noticed less flies in my home from my backdoor over the past week.  However, this indoor trap has caught zero flies yet over one week, while the outdoor traps have caught a combined 75-100.  I get excited looking at the trap thinking a fly was caught, but then realize that is the picture of a fly instead:-(.  Don't waste your money on this product."
5.0,Awsome Pop Tarts,"I hadn't had Pop Tarts for years, but then I happened to run across this listing and figured I'd try them.  They're just plane awsome.  I mean, as Pop Tarts go, they are anyway.  Afterall, they're not particularly healthy, and they do have lots of sugar.  But, I remember eating various flavors of these quite often when I was a kid, so they have definately the nostalgia factor going for them.  They nailed the pumpkin taste, so I'm giving 5 stars and placing an order for more."
1.0,Ugh!,"This popcorn was either very old or just poor quality. More than half the kernals did not pop, we ended up throwing more than half of the box of unpopped popcorn Kettle corn away. Total waste of money."
1.0,BEWARE!!,I have bought hundreds of items on amazon over the years but written very few reviews. I felt compelled to warn others with this cereal. I disregarded the other bad reviews thinking maybe they just had idiosyncratic reactions. My baby vomitted twice with this cereal two weeks apart. There needs to be an investigation with all these bad reviews.
1.0,Second Mess,This was a replacement for the 1st order of almond butter I place. It also arrived with two of the three bottles having oil running down the sides. I quit!
1.0,Not food if you want taste and texture in return for calories,"We received a flyer in the mail -- an assortment of foods, beef, pork, and these really awful stuffed sole with crab and scallops. Well, like a dummy, I bought the deal. So, perhaps the truth on Omaha Steaks: The sole stuffed with scallops and crab is really a shread of sole stuffed with a paste which I am hesitant to describe. It is not good to eat. When our package arrived, we selected two filets mignon, two sole stuffed with scallops and crab, and four potatoes au gratin. The potatoes were edible. The beef tenderloin was too thin to grill, but we grilled it anyway. Awful. I have already commented on the sole. Still angry 12 hours later (color me stupid does not sit well with me!) I re-read all the information Omaha Steaks had sent us -- and conformed my suspicion that no where do these people state the grade of beef they sell. The quality of the sole stuffed with scallops and crab is perhaps compatable with a very cheap diner on the interstate -- ""Well, you are hungry. This is cheap. You thought it might be good/interesting"" OK/ We have all made those mistakes on a long road trip -- but to buy this kind of nasty food to serve at home  -- I don't think so."
1.0,Marketing Gimmick - Focus on easy pour bottle - Substandard olive oil,"Buyer beware of this product.  It coagulates and congeals to a thick white paste when chilled.  It takes on the appearance of solid animal fat.  I  called Sovena USA Inc for an answer.  The Sovena Inc. Customer Service Rep. took a week to get back to me and then explained that this is a ""blend"" and should not be chilled.  He could not tell me what is  in this blend and said that it will take time for him to research and get an answer for me.  I am still waiting for his response (almost 2 weeks later).  I subsequently purchased Botticelli Olive Oil to see if it reacted the same way when chilled and  thankfully it did not.  I made the exact same tomato salad using the 2 brands of oil and the Oliveri blend encased the tomatoes in a greasy thick disgusting mess.  The tomato salad made with the Botticelli Oil looked as appetizing when I took it out of the fridge as it did when I put it in.  Tomato Salad Recipe: 2 ripe vine tomatoes - cut in large cubes 1/2 cup olive oil - (I recommend Botticelli Extra Virgin Olive Oil) 3 cloves crushed garlic 1 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. oregano Mix ingredients together, chill for at least 1 hour  and serve"
1.0,True Grit,"I recently prepared waffles with this product.  The result was gritty like dental polish, and not edible to me or the two people that tried it with me."
5.0,Really good!,These taste like the real thing!  They are delicious!  And very easy to make!  My whole family loves them - even the ones who aren't gluten-free (like me)!
5.0,Super Soup!,"Actually, I couldn't make a soup this good even if I had all the indregients, and a fully-stocked kitchen.  The flavors are crisp and balanced, not too veggie-heavy nor too sharp, just the right balance and thickness.  And they are almost complete -- you just add milk, or water, and more ingredients if you happen to have them -- bell peppers, for instance -- and you have a full-fledged soup.  The Comida Loca soups are not ""open and serve soups"" nor are they just stock to which you have to source and prepare all the ingredients -- they are ALMOST complete from the container, and you add a little bit (milk, corn chips, etc) at the end.  So they are a terrific mix of easy but not over-preocessed.  As you can tell, I am a big fan and always have a variety of them on hand -- perfect for a northeast winter's day!"
1.0,Watch out for Canola oil,These chips are indeed tasty. But one of the main ingredients is canola oil. Unfortunately 93% of canola oil used in the US is genetically modified. [...] Unless the canola oil says it's organic it's GMO.
1.0,never got my chai,i ordered my chai 2 weeks ago and paid 45 dallars for next day shiping and i still havent recived them.
5.0,We love the smell !,"The smell is great. After shampooing and conditioning Gracie's hair is so soft and she smells so good. Wonderful product. We have been using this product for the past 2 years. Ed, Clarkesville, GA"
1.0,Package and shipping issue,"I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.  First, the box was the same size as the bag of dog food and had no additional packing.  I'm fairly certain the bag was opened or starting to open prior to being packaged and shipped.  Needless to say, when the package arrived via UPS, I opened it in the garage and the contents of the bag went everywhere.  Half of the bottom of the bag was open.  I lost at least half of the bag.  In addition, I don't know how long the bag was sitting opened.  It's probably not an issue with dry dog food, but you never really know.  All I can say is I wouldn't buy an opened bag of dog food at the pet store.  What I intended as a convenience of having this brand of dog food shipped directly to me, turned into a wasted amount of food and a lot of clean up.  I gave a shipping review to Amazon last week, but there was never any ""I am sorry for your inconvenience"" or any other type of apology.  I'm gathering these reviews are only spot checked. The Wellness dog food itself seems to be a high quality dog food that my dogs enjoy.  I'm just very reluctant to purchase this through Amazon again.  If I would have thought of it at the time, I would have taken some pictures and posted them online. I was so irritated and it's just not worth the time for this particular product to do a RMA.  Buyer beware."
5.0,dogs dont know its not american,Most people have a cow that it isn't American made but I work in an office where a lot of people bring in their dogs and I have yet to find one who didn't like this.
1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"Received exactly ONE item - not the multi-pack as described. Petco blamed Amazon, Amazon blamed Petco. Payment was refunded, but trust in Amazon and Petco lost."
5.0,100% Pure Organic Sunflower Butter - no soy here!,"I originally ordered this product as an allergy-free alternative to peanut butter.  I have many serious food allergies (peanut, walnut, almond, dairy, gluten, corn, soy), and another popular brand of sunflower seed butter (sunbutter) is manufactured on equipment that also processes soy (not just in a shared facility, but on shared equipment)!  I am thrilled to say that this sunflower butter is not only smooth and creamy with a delicious taste, but it's organic, has no added salt or sugar, and is free of other allergens.  Give it a try, I bet you will love it!"
5.0,Delicious Bargain Taffy,I have always had a sweet tooth and this is some of the best taffy I've tried.  Any candy this delicious and fresh is a sure hit with those that can enjoy it. My package didn't stand a chance of lasting very long. Highly recommended to any taffy enthusiast!
5.0,Chocolate Fix,"These muffins are a real chocolate fix. I lost 45 lbs. and I love chocolate!  These bake up perfect every single time and they are rich chocolate flavor, high in protein and fiber and very low fat. These can take care of a chocolate craving without cheating on a weight loss plan and boy oh boy does the fiber work well too!"
5.0,Sweet and flavorful,"I drink mostly water every day, so was looking for something to change it up that had some flavor but that was also decaf.  These little tubes of Lipton to-go stix decaf iced green tea mix are convenient, and tasty.  The taste is a little to sweet for me so I use a half a tube per bottle of water or add ice cubes to help dilute it in a glass.  This is very tasty, not grainy at all as long as you shake or stir it well.  It is a great way to stay hydrated and mix up the taste of bland water when you are sick of it.  I would recommend these for any busy person, to throw in your bag for a flavorful drink anytime and anywhere. I will buy these again and am looking forward to trying their other flavors."
5.0,It's all I eat for breakfast now,"I love this cereal.  It's crunchy and slightly sweet-much better tasting than any other ""flakes"" I've had.  And it's sooooo filling.  My work makes it difficult to eat between 9am and 2pm (the time I'd normally eat the majority of my calories).  This cereal gets me through without making me feel overly full or bloated (unlike, say, grapenuts or oatmeal).  And then there's all the benefits of flax and fiber.  My 3 year old likes it.  Even my husband likes it and he's very adverse to ""health foods"".  I'm a big fan.  I just wish I could buy it in larger bulk."
5.0,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,Best coffee in the world.  When you open a can and sniff ---- ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!  Can't go wrong with Yuban.
1.0,Worst Hot chocolate ever!,"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
5.0,Bone Suckin Sauce,"I love, love, love this sauce.  I wish I could get it from a local store.  It makes a great marinade or a great brush on bbq sauce.  You've got to try this sauce!!!"
1.0,Avoid ReStockIt -- Sloppy Vendor,"I ordered a 32 pack of Gatorade mix. The item description was clear: it indicated in two places the order would be for 32 packs, each 21 oz., and that the total package weight was 46.3 lbs. However, I received a single pack, about 2 lbs.  When I emailed about the status of the other 31 items, I was told the item description was incorrect and was given a refund. That was an appropriate response for the seller, but I would have preferred the remaining 31 items I had purchased.  I'll note that another buyer had a similar problem just today: they ordered 30 staplers and received only one. There appears to be a systemic problem with this seller, so I would recommend avoiding them."
5.0,"Excellent and fresh product, reasonable price","I live in Puerto Rico, and finding almond flour is virtually impossible. I was thrilled to find this product at a reasonable price. I wish that I had ordered more--I used the almost the full pound within a week! I will definitely order this again."
5.0,Green Mountain French Vanilla Coffee--Yum,Hubby and I both really like this coffee.  The only thing we found wrong with it is that it could use a wee more vanilla.
1.0,Not what I expected,"I made two loves in my Zoji, and they both came out flat and wet (moist). Blah! I even cut back the water 1/2 cup and still the same. I used the basic settings on my machine. I followed Zoji directions and then Pamela's on the second loaf. If anyone out there has a Zoji and thier bread is coming out great, please respond back. I would love to know your secrets. I have 4 more times to try, and if they do no turn out, I will not be purchasing the product again."
5.0,"Yum!  Rich, strong, and not bitter.",Bought this during one of Amazon's Friday Sales.  Did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new.  Took a chance and am very pleased.  We like our coffee rich and strong and this one delivers.  Great tasting dark roast coffee!
1.0,My family loved the flavor of this drink...,"I originally rated this product with only one star because I didn't like it at all when I drank it.  However, I have come back to revise my review after sharing it with other members of my family.  They absolutely loved it and were fighting not to drink all the cans at one sitting!  After one adult and three children (aged 9-15) said it tasted very good, I decided it was just me who didn't like the taste.  Unfortunately I can't seem to change the number of stars I gave it, but if I could, I would give it five because I was definitely over-ruled in my opinion of the flavor.  Don't go by what I say; go by what my family says. :-)"
1.0,Most weren't flavored,"I didn't expect to receive the exact mix that is pictured, but I assumed that it would be representative of what we'd received. We received 4 flavored coffees (2 each of Golden French Toast and Pumpkin Spice). The other 20 coffees were a variety of blends, but not what I consider ""flavored"" coffees (Columbian, Nantucket Blend, Caribou Blend, Folgers Lively Columbian).  So if you are looking for flavored coffees, I don't suggest this item!  After re-reading the product description that says ""This variety sampler includes only flavored caffeinated coffee."", I got even more annoyed. My package included only 4 flavored coffees and it also included decaf! So I decided to return the item - then learned that it was non-returnable. I followed the links to correspond with customer service, and after a few minutes of chatting with someone, they said that they'd refund my money. Doesn't sound like a standard policy - but I'm glad that amazon.com stands behind their website.  JoAn"
1.0,disgusting,"I really like the plain pb2 flavor, so I figured chocolate will taste amazing because I'm a big fan of all things chocolate.  But PB2 really dissapointed.  This TASTES AWFUL. DO NOT BUY!! How can they charge so much money for such a terrible product????"
5.0,coconut saved my life,"I love the plain coconut water no flavors! I was having leg cramps the were killing me ,and coconut water is the best for that!  I also would like to be a sales person for  coconut water  we do not have it here in the city of Williston  we do not have it in any of the stores here."
5.0,Great food,"We tried many dog foods over the first 3yrs and while she would eat any of them she frequently would throw up. We have been on Organix for a year now and the only time she vomited was when I decided to try Blue dog food. We are now exclusively Organix customers. I forgot to mention, people always comment on her beautiful coat. This is a great food."
5.0,"We love these when we camp out,.",We both love the powdered eggs from long ago so much we were happy to find these and take them camping. They are good with cheese and bacon in a burrito or to add to cakes etc.
1.0,NO MORE MEYENBERG!,"THE CAN DOES NOT SAY ""NO ANTIBIOTICS"". I called the company and asked why the can does not say this.  First, she tells me that THEY HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS BUT the FDA won't allow them to put it on their can.  I said ""lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label"".  Then she said we are making a new label.  I felt a definate flippant attitude.  I felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone.  Well, I just canceled my autoship for their goat milk. I am now looking for another goat milk that puts ""no antibiotics"" on their label.  I know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this."
1.0,NOT ORGANIC!!!,"In search for a whole grain, organic, unsweetened, and unsalted cereals, I was happy to run across this puffed wheat.  It tastes good but not organic.  I read every single prints on the bag.  There is no mention of its being organic, which is important to me since being organic = non-GMO.  All Arrowhead Mills puffed products are advertised as ""ORGANIC"" but only the Kamut cereal has the organic seal.  I'm switching to kamut cereal.  I gave it 1 star to get other buyers' attention."
1.0,BPA in lids?,I just learned that these lids are lined with a material that contains BPA. I fed lots of jars to my daughter so I am quite upset. Just canceled all of my subscriptions to Earth's Best jars. I am very disappointed. If you want to get this confirmed I would encourage you to contact the company.
1.0,Where Is My Package Ordered November 10th?,Where is my package ordered November 10th and promised November 16th? It is now November 21st and no package. Please write to me at pfay@cox.net.
1.0,Instant Coffee,I hope you are reading these reviews.  I did not.  This is instant coffee inside a K-cup container.  The description is deceptive.
1.0,Avoid this one,"This does have a slight curry flavor, but some other awful flavor overpowers the sauce. To make it tolerable, I had to add peanut butter, sugar, and chipotle pepper. And even then, it wasn't great. It's not very spicy either (coming from someone who likes very spicy food). I will not buy this again, and it was so bad, I won't be buying any of the other curry sauces Kikkoman offers."
5.0,exceptional,"These franks have a great texture and flavor,just a hint of smokey taste.A great treat anytime of year and wonderful on the grill."
1.0,Foul tasting coffee,"This is without a doubt the worst tasting coffee we have ever purchased.  It does not smell like coffee.  It does not taste like coffee.  If you were to walk into an old automotive repair shop and buy a cup from a vending machine it would taste better than this.  If you served this in your store as a courtesy to your ""guests"" you would lose business. The only use I can see for this product is to spread it in the garden to prevent slug and snail infestation."
1.0,Lasted a whole 4 days.,"Purchased at Lowes to keep my dog from digging holes in my landscaping. Scattered it on Monday, had new holes by Friday."
1.0,"They changed their recipe to cut corners, now it tastes horrible","this was a 5 star sauce, now it's a one star. they have started cutting corners in the last few months (as of 10/15/12) and this sauce is no longer quality or worth the 9 dollar asking price. im very disapointed as i previously said this is the best jar sauce, but it isn't anymore.. they started being cheap and the quality suffered, now they can keep their new garbage sauce, its no better tasting than the average two dollar tomato pastey aauces on the shelves. go with newman's own, that was the next best thing i've tried."
1.0,Very strong smell - breaks down easily.,"I will admit that it masks urine odors very well and that's nice, but the litter itself smells so strongly that we've only been able to live with it for one day. We keep our litterbox in the bathroom, and in such a small room, the smell is too much to bear. It's like hot gravel mixed with wood chips mixed with cat poop because it doesn't mask that smell.  In addition, the pellets break down very quickly. When I checked this morning, part of the top layer of the litterbox in the very front was a fine powder. We bought this in hopes it would be low tracking - but I'm already seeing the shredded pellets around and about."
5.0,Best You Can Find!,"The best curry around.  It is so flavorful, not too spicy, but full of aromatic flavor.  It is superior and my family absolutely adores it.  It will take a while to ship because it is coming from another country outside the US.  It is well worth the wait.  I use it in so many recipes, but of course our favorite is Chicken Roti! Love this curry!!!!"
5.0,Cute & economical,Used for an aqua blue & brown baby boy themed baby shower. Placed stickers on front. Totally cute & very economical. Would use same idea for future give aways.
1.0,Vanilla-y no good-y,"I agree with the reviewer that the vanilla flavor in this is very prominent. In fact, it pretty nearly wiped out any flavor of the ""Indian Spice"" that is in this tea. Barely a hint of the cardamom, cinnamon, black pepper and other flavors that are supposed to be in here. I have been drinking Chai for years and have never come across a single one that had vanilla. Now I know why. Stay away if you want a traditional Chai."
5.0,I just love this soup!,"I have been buying these at my local health food store on sale which is sometimes cheaper than Amazon. But I wanted to buy a lot because we have been working so much lately that it has been really hard to get in good, quick, satisfying meals. The flavor of this soup is wonderful. The lime and cilantro make it very tasty and flavorful. I love most of the flavors, but like black bean and spring onion the best. My husband really loves the hot and sour, tamale and tortilla flavors. The black bean soup is super filling and I can definitely see why there are two servings in each cup. Sometimes I struggle to eat the whole thing unless I'm really hungry. Black beans are naturally high in calories but they are so good for you and have so much fiber (28g per cup). I really don't see why people have complained about the serving size/calorie content. I have never gained weight eating these and on the contrary have lost weight given the large amount of fiber. I have had to struggle with my weight in the past like many people and have come to realize that calories aren't worth counting if the food isn't really good for you in the first place. Overall, I really like this soup and when prepared correctly (add seasoning, stir, add boiling water, stir well, then cover for 8 minutes and stir again), it is absolutely delicious."
5.0,Cats Devour it and Have More Energy,"Our two boys were on Science Diet hairball light for many years. But once we switched them to Core, there was no going back--this even smells like real food. They have much more energy--my 11 year old is like a kitten, chasing, running, pouncing, tumbling. He's always up for a good romp being a manx, but this food took it up a notch. Nice small size helps in digestion too, and no real hairball problems. One downside may be that their waste is bit more, uh, pungent (likely because this isn't just corn and cardboard they're eating)."
5.0,Tastes like regular spaghetti noodles to me!,I honestly can tell no difference between this product and wheat noodles.  It is a lovely find for a pasta lover:)
5.0,Great,Since we moved from the NYC area I can not get this product.  I was so happy to see that I could get it from Amazon.
5.0,Pretty good egg replacement,"Although not as good as eggs , it is fairly satisfactory as an egg replacement product."
5.0,decalcification made easy,"Product as expected. The bag in which the citric acid is shipped is clearly not for storage after opening the bag once - just use three zip-lock gallon bags to divide the contents into portions. I used it for the espresso machine, dishwasher etc for decalcification with great success (and we really have hard water). you will find a lot of recommendations on the internet."
5.0,Awesome Flavor - Great Pricing!,I have always loved teas.  I started to drink more green tea lately cause I heard it was good for the body.  This tea is especially good.  The spices with the green tea are amazing.  The hint of orange peel compliments without over powering the flavor.
5.0,The best,"The best coffee I've ever had - cannot be satisfied with any other, and will not be without this wonderful product."
5.0,My Cat Loves This Stuff,"My cat loves this stuff.  She has diabetes and these are the best treats for her because they are all protein and no carbs.  I test her blood for glucose and have to prick her ears.  This is her reward and she knows that if she puts up with me she gets a nice, fat free, carb free delicious treat.  Take care of your pets and give them nutritious freeze dried meat/chicken rather than the junk food treats that are loaded with uneeded carbs.  Also, this is a great price and a large bag lasts for a long time.  Cat and dog Pure Bites are exactly the same with larger pieces in the bag for dogs.  Just break them up and kitties love them too.  I also use the crushed treats to top off a meal and make it tastier.  When my friend's bring their dogs by, they always get some too.  All of the pets love this product!!!"
5.0,fantastic sauce!,"There are plenty of reviews about this sauce that I feel did a good job describing it. I'll focus on what jumped out at me in particular. First off, when you open up the bottle (after shaking it to death, just like you should on all extract sauces) you notice an aroma distinctly vinegar, with naga fruitieness and a hint of garlic. The taste is just amazing! You can't even taste the extract over the powerful naga sweetness. The one area you will surely notice the extract is in your stomach. Never use this stuff on an already empty stomach, best to prime the pumps. Even an iron gut may fall pray to uncontrollable stomach cramps. And yes, this stuff is pretty hot. Way to hot for most people in fact, even though I was only able to make my bottle last a week (did I mention that I eat whole naga jolokia peppers with no liquid or food?). So if you are able to finish your bottle in a week email me at ... we'll get together and get our heads checked."
5.0,Pleasant,"I'm a tea lover from birth and this combination of Jasmine with Green gives a beautiful aroma and taste. One teabag gives you a robust flavor, eqivalent of loose tea brewed in a teapot. Very very pleased."
5.0,Excellent flavor,"The producer of this item is a customer where I work.  He brought in a case to share with the staff.  I cannot get enough.  I use it in my tuna and egg salads and on any deli meat sandwich for a totally different taste.  A little hot, as is mustard, but a touch of sweetness.  OMG!"
1.0,Lousy!,"After getting this make believe product I wrote to the distributor of Bookbinder's soups and Bookbinder's in Philadelphia to give them my opinion of their snapper soup. This isn't even close to what Old Original Bookbinder's soup should taste like. It is thin and the only additional item that you can chew is not Snapper, but carrots. It is the worst I have ever tasted, period. It was also reassutring to me to just this week have a food commentator say the exact same thing that I said. It is a make believe Snapper soup."
5.0,Best taste in artificial sweeteners,"Ideal has the best most sugar like taste of all artificial sweeteners I've ever tried.  There is no aftertaste like other brands in everything I used it in, except maybe my coffee, and then it is just barely noticeable.  Plus, it contains xylitol which is claimed to kill bacteria in the mouth that causes gum disease."
5.0,Just like I remember it,"The first time I had Cotswold cheese was in London when I visited decades ago.  I haven't been able to find it in the United States since then, though to be honest I haven't looked hard until now.  But now that I found this cheese on Amazon I'm overjoyed.  It's the same addictively delicious taste I remember from my time in London -- and infinitely easier to purchase! The cheese is scrumptious, and was shipped very carefully with ice packs to keep it fresh.  I recommend both the Cotswold and the vendor very highly."
1.0,No direction oily goo,I have liked the other products by this company so I gave this a chance.My husband and daughters have dry scalp and I thought this might help. It's a good thing I got it free because it is going in the garbage after one try. I looked all over for directions on how to use this product I even searched online and found nothing so I shampooed and then tried to condition there scalps with this stuff. It was like putting peanut butter in their hair. It felt like vasalen. Once their hair dried it was an oily mess that wouldn't wash out. So if you like the oily look this is for you:} P>S another reviewer said Dawn will help take it out. Thank you it did help:}
1.0,Disappointed - once cooked all the color disappeared.,"I planned to make rainbow cake in a jar for my son's first birthday.  The colors were not vibrant like regular food color, but were pretty and rich.  At least in the uncooked cake batter.  But when the cakes came out of the oven, there was no trace of color at all.  It looked like I had just baked regular yellow cake with no dye whatsoever.  I was so so sad to be serving plain cake in a jar."
5.0,Pretty Darned Close to KFC,"I can mix up something close to the KFC flavor, but it's a pain because it requires using alot of herbs and spices. But this is the closest prepackaged yet. It has a delicious flavor to it, and I didn't find it at all salty like one of the reviewers mentioned."
5.0,Good Product Bad Handeling,"This drink contains no Fat and no Sodium, calories are less then most soft drinks. The no Sodium helps keep the blood pressure down which makes this a great soft drink for people who need to watch there salt intake. The order was placed on a Thursday and delivered on a Saturday, however there were seven badly damaged cans, one so bad it was empty. The reason I bought from Amazon was because the product was not stocked in our area and the store would not special order it. I purchased 5 flats each containing 4 six packs."
1.0,Too sweet,"I have a HUGE sweet tooth, and even I can't deal with the excessive sweetness of these choco bananas. There is such thing as ""too sweet"" in this world after all, I have realized."
5.0,My mother LOVED it!,"I sent this gift basket to my mom and she loved it.  The presentation is lovely and it comes with a wide variety of tea flavors, as well as some cookies. For anyone who is an avid tea lover, this is a great gift!"
5.0,Great buy on gluten free vanilla!,This vanilla has great flavor and what a bargain for the size jar.  Although the jar is large it is easy to use and not a problem at all.  I will be buying this again since it is a superb quality product at a great price!
1.0,ick!,"If you are looking for a rice substitute-don't try this one! You'd be better off using brown rice if you are looking for a healthy alternative.  The horrible smell aside, this was very very slippery and gooey. I tried it in a ""rice dish"" and the consistency was more soup like than rice like. Although it took on the flavor of the dish I made, it did not absorb as rice does and the whole thing was a fishy, sloppy slimy mess.  I have had the noodles and they are OK but this product-YUCK!"
1.0,awful after taste,I have eight of these bottles sitting in my cupbard and unfortunately I cannot get myself to drink them. Awful after taste in the plastic bottle. Will not buy this product again. The boxed version tastes much better.
1.0,"Too sour, almost feels like rotten","It may be a bad batch, I bought when amazon had them for sale 1/3rd price of today :) That should have made it clear, do not buy"
1.0,HYPE water!!!,"I'd tried the water the other day because of all the HYPE about it... It was just that, a HYPE, forget it, don't waste your money on it.  Is not worth it.  Sorry! NEXT!!!!!"
5.0,Great stuff!,"It smells fresh and delicious, and the price is much better than what you get at the grocery store. I wish I discovered Frontier spices sooner. I look forward to trying their curry blend next."
1.0,Every box had 100 cookies...,"I mean cookie pieces very embarrassing gifts. I will not being buying from this product line EVER again...Walkers Shortbread Lemon Thins, 4.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)"
1.0,Do not waste your money!,"Like everyone who loves peanut butter. but prefers to eat lower calorie foods, I was excited to find this in the store. It is completely inedible. I cannot see how anyone could have thought this tasted well enough to produce and sell. I really did want to like it, but just the memory of how bad it tasted is enough to make me queasy. Instead of focusing on being ""calorie-free"" Walden Farms should reformulate the product so it can be low in calories, but actually taste good."
5.0,Wow so smooth and rich,Great taste.  Hard to describe.  It is smooth but not weak.  No bitter after taste.  No complaints from anyone over the holidays.  Satisfied the more starbuck taste leaners in the family and also the flavor coffee lovers.
1.0,GROSS,"Does not taste like any honey mustard I have tried before.  I wanted my own supply of these handy little pre-packaged servings, and I picked the one with ingredients similar to good stuff I have had from restaurants.  Well, this one tastes nasty.  Hardly any honey or mustard flavor.  It just tastes like sugar and vinegar."
5.0,Yummy in my Tummy,"Fantastic! Excellent on fish or steak. I use it as a dip, but I bet it would marinade well too."
5.0,Yummy & no additives,"This sunflower seed butter has a nice roasted taste & is very creamy.  The consistency is actually runny compared to peanut butter.  I just pour it out of the jar, but it is still thick.  I've never eaten it like a ""peanut"" butter & jelly sandwich, I usually mix it into yogurt with fruit.  It also makes a good fruit dip if mixed with equal parts of coconut oil, a little cocoa, & a little honey.  If you freeze the dip in mini muffin papers, it becomes ""candy"".  All in all, very tasty & no additives."
1.0,"Suzie's Flatbread, Corn Sesame, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12) (Grocery)","10/30/2010  Suzie's Flatbread, Corn Sesame, 4.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)  I purchase 2 boxes 12 packs in each box I open the first box and the cracker smells very bad I need to returned it to Amazon I think Amazon should inspect food items before sale to the public  KOBI, NY"
5.0,"Cost-efficient, healthy, and with a wonderful taste.","This powder milk is more cost-efficient than regular liquid milk. The taste, once suspended in water, is delicious, especially when frothed. The powder dissolves (more accurately, suspends) completely in water if you add it once the water has started whirling in the blender. I have been successful at mixing it completely without any residue by means of a blender, frother, or Moo Mixer. The resulting milk's taste is excellent, although it is not identical with liquid milk. Once mixed in with cocoa or coffee, however, there is no taste difference that I can detect."
5.0,WOW,"Wow is this stuff ever the greatest.  i like to mix it into my miracle whip and eat it on my hamburgers.  love it, love it, love it.  Wasbi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Yucko!,I thought that this was a great idea for a K-Cup...still do...but after one cup we threw the rest of it away...oh my!
1.0,Blah- tastes weird,"Depending on your taste, you might find the flavoring weird. I usually buy breakfast blends and add french vanilla creamer so I decided to try french vanilla coffee and then add half and half. Yuck! I'll stick with breakfast blends and regular cofee"
1.0,old stock???,"arrived with over 75% broken pieces, seemed stale. I was extreamly disapointed in this product. Would avoid buying again. It was the first time in this household that candy got thrown out"
1.0,broken cookies,I have ordered more than 12 cases of Murrays cookies in the past.  This shipment of cookies more than half of the cookies in the sack were broken.  This is either a manufacturing problem or a shipment problem with this order.
5.0,Excellent Taste,These cranberries are plump and taste great. They have a nice aroma and just the right amount of sugar. Great.
5.0,Great for Eggnog. These little grinders are the best. Regular on our table. You will be hooked after the first taste.,"Awesome nutmeg flavor. Great for topping eggnog coffee, latee, anything.  Drogheria & Alimentari is one of the best worldwide  spices and aromatic herbs providers.  They now have spices, aromatic herbs and exquisite blends of fragrances from Mediterranean bottled in very attractive glass jars with a  patented built-in grinder top .   This preserves the spices and herbs in their whole and not ground form and makes them possess a higher quality.  Grinding them just before consuming gives you  the utmost experience of their aromatic power to excite the senses of smell and taste."
1.0,Yuck!,"I too had severe stomach reaction to these. The flavor is poor, hardly any flavor at all. They are so hard you can chew them w/o risking damage to dental work. I can imagine anyone wanting these.. I gave them all away at work rather than just tossing them in the garbage. DONT WASTE YOU MONEY THEY ARE AWFUL ALL THE WAY AROUND."
5.0,I Love Them!!!,"This snack is absolutely delicious!!!  They are crunchy and have a nutty flavor.  I follow the Weight Watchers plan and this snack is completely compatible with my weight loss efforts.  I highly recommend trying them and I'm sure you will be hooked, just like I am."
1.0,Don't buy it here from Vitacost,"Oh HOW DARE YOU MAIL ME CHOCOLATE THAT HAS MELTED??!! When I opened the chocolate bar, I could clearly see the cocoa powder separated from the cocoa butter. It is a disaster!!! If I had ordered this and let you Vitacost mail it to my friend, YOU ARE GONNA MESS UP BIG TIME!!!  This chocolate bar is the best from chocolove, highly recommended. But if you want to buy, go to local Whole Foods or buy it from Chocolove directly.  DO NOT BUY IT FROM VITACOST!"
1.0,Watch out for new deceptive packaging,"I emailed Nabisco regarding their new Saltine crackers that the package says ""original"" which are horrible and have no taste and are hard as bricks.  I received a reply from Nabisco verifying that they indeed did change the recipe in December 2011 and removed original salt and are now adding sea salt.  The new package is deceptive as it says ""original"" but once you taste the new ones, you will know that they are as far from original as you can get.  I have found that Keebler Zesta saltines are really good and I have switched to them after eating Nabisco saltines for 46 years.  It is ashamed that American manufacturers just can't leave a classic product alone and have ruined it."
1.0,This is a little pricey don't you think?,"A 2 pound bag of regular AP flour for $42 is pretty stupid, don't you think? Is it made with real gold?"
1.0,yick-- too bitter!,"I originally tried the variety pack that came with my Keurig and it had the Bold Organic from coffee people which was excellent-- I went online to buy some and saw all the great reviews for Black Tiger which steered me to buy it instead of the Organic. Boy, what mistake-- it was VERY bitter and I was stuck with two boxes of it!  If you like your coffee with a bite then go for it.  This is bitter even at the mug setting. If you like your coffee smooth avoid this like the plague! After two months of trying to use this up, I'm finally finished with it. I was the only one in my family that would go near it-- it was like swallowing a bitter pill every day.  Never again! I thought I should warn those out there from being swayed by bitter-coffee lovers. David"
1.0,CUTE BUT DAMAGED,One of the gingerbread walls arrived broken. Was able to repair as best as possible. CUTE house that would have been much better if not damaged.
1.0,the WRONG stuff,Received the wrong item.......I received ORGANIC RAW CACAO POWDER which still contains the fat.  I didn't notice until after I had opened and used the product. Not too happy about that!
1.0,This coffee tastes aweful,The taste is burning even when fresh and has no coffee aroma.  It is very unlike the usual quality I expect from Starbucks.
1.0,Re-packaged Jiffy,This is perfetly identical to Jiffy peanutbutter. We did a blind taste-test and we couldn't tell the diffrence. We even drank black coffee in-between (it acts as a reset for your senses).
1.0,Disappointed in Assortment Received,"While I was expecting to receive 6 DIFFERENT types of bacon - this is not what was sent.  I received 3 of the same pepper variety.  Felt like they just through in what they had in overstock.  Since this was a gift, I was embarrassed."
5.0,hubby loves these,"I sent them to him in Iraq, I wish amazon.com would ship their foods like this to apo, I mean why would I buy food online unless I was in a place where I couldn't go to a store?"
5.0,Creamy goodness,Tried this tea at a nearby cafe. It was served hot with whipped cream. 1.95 per cup.  My friend and I were instantly hooked. The cafe's gift shop sold the tea for 1.75 per packet. We came home and found this deal. Now we buy the tea here. We were told by the cafe owner to add very hot (to boiling) water to the cup. This mixture has to seep for a few minutes. Now we can have this great tea at home for less than a third the price. I took a few packets in my luggage when visiting my daughter. She does not care for chia tea of any kind. She was also hooked on the tea's spicy creamy taste. Beware of trying this one. You may have a new favorite hot and cold beverage!
1.0,We do not recommend this gum!,"We share gum at work between 5 of us, so I decided to get creative and purchase the Spry five flavor pack. Big mistake...it had great flavor for about one minute, it looses it's flavor and is hard to chew. We are addicted to chewing gum and will continue our search for the best gum with xylitol. We will not purchase this gum again and do not recommend it to you!"
5.0,Delicious Black Beans!,I love black beans and these are delicious.  Much better than canned.  I am so glad they are available in a resealable bag! I make the amount that I need and put the rest away. Quick and easy.
5.0,Great tea,"Ever since I picked this up at a local organic shop, I am addicted.  This tea has so much flavor, its fantastic.  And the sayings on the tea bags are so nice to read.  A wonderful way to wind down after a day with little ones. I add natural sweetener Stevia to it to sweeten it, which I normally don't like using due to a bit of an aftertaste, but in this tea, it works wonderfully.  I am picky about tea, this tea is excellent."
1.0,"OMG, horrible","this is the worst bread I have ever eaten. I followed the directions, and the bread is very gritty because of the bean flour. I used 1 bag, plan on using the rest for something else. blech."
1.0,Milka Choco Drink Powder,"Does not completely disolve in milk, poor flaver, I expected the taste to be better than American produced chocolate drink. One needed substantally more drink powder than American products. I was extremely disappointed, and I would never buy it again. I have used the Milka discs in the Bosch machine with great results."
1.0,Overpriced + bogus reviews,"You're better off buying a powder and making your own tea. These tea bags are overpriced, not to mention that ALL of the reviews are bogus, and more than likely from the people working for or related to the manufacturer. Just check their other reviews (if there are any).  Chaga is a potent mushroom, but get the real deal and make sure it's organic."
1.0,I wouldn't normally review like this but it came in my Amazon email so I just had to take a swing at it.,"This Hostess Chocolate Pudding Pie literally has a laundry-list of bad and even worse ingredients  and reads like a chemistry problem. Let's start with enriched wheat flour, vegetable(s) oil shortening - including partially hydrogenated oil(s), corn syrup, plus high fructose corn syrup, plus-plus more sweetener as sugar, modified corn starch, soy protein isolate, even more vegetable(s) oils as partially hydrogenated, beef fat. Now blend in some titanium dioxide, artificial flavors and food colors yellow 5 and red 40. Do you really want this ""food"" around for your kids to eat? Not recommended in my world."
1.0,this is not beef broth,"This has no beef in it at all. It is made from soy.  I believe it's labeling is totally misleading however I now see the ingredient list on the Amazon page, wish I would have read it before.  When something is labeled ""Beef Broth Concentrate"" I expect it to be exactly that.  I was so excited to find this under an 'English beef tea' search, but so disappointed when I smell it and did not smell a hint of beef.  That is when I read the ingredient list and saw no beef listed. I added lots to my pot roast gravy and it did not add to the beef flavor at all. Only buy this if you want to support sellers who falsely name and advertise their items.   Smithers Beef Broth Concentrate, 32-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2) "
5.0,"Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities","One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!"
1.0,a bad price,"I use this and actually do like it. I buy some things in bulk from Amazon because I can get a price that is less than I can buy it at the store.  My Publix always carries this for 3.49/per. This price is almost 4.00/per.  Maybe you could check with another supplier, Amazon. I will buy it if it's less than what my Publix sells it for."
5.0,Paradise Fruit Mix,"This product met and exceeded my expectations! It contained an outstanding mix of fruit and  wonderful looking cherries. Upon opening, the aroma was fragrant and the mix was extremely fresh. The cookies baked using the product were moist and flavorful. Will I purchase this again - without a doubt! Outstanding!!"
1.0,Evo Chicken & Turkey or Duck Can Food - kitty rejection,"Don't know what mfg did to the Evo Cat Food - Turkey & Chicken as well as Duck.  My cats refuse to eat this very expensive cat food.  This was one of the very few my cat would eat and now I need to search for another.  Took months to find this.  My ""natural"" pet product store was very disappointed by the sale of this company and wasn't sure if they would carry this product.  Any one else out there having this food rejection by their finicky kitty?"
5.0,Great tomatoes,I had been unhappy with the expensive sundried tomatoes in the market. I took a chance with this product.  They are delicious!!!  So easy to store. And a great source of the antioxidant lycopene!!  I will order them again. VERY happy w/ quality and price.
1.0,NOT MILK !,After searching to find the bean with MILK chocolate and paying extra to get it here before Christmas I open the box and find that they are in fact DARK chocolate.  Clearly states Milk chocolate in the description.  Now its too late to resolve the issue before Christmas.  No phone numbers to call so that customer service can overnight what I ordered.
5.0,Great transaction,"I've been drinking these juices for over a year.  When I stop for a while, I can tell the difference in the way I feel.  Buying these from Amazon with Subscribe & Save really came out to almost half of what they are in the store.  Plus ... they are delivered to my front door in two days.  Way to go, Amazon !!!"
5.0,Hidden Valley Ranch,"My favorite dressing arrived in perfect condition, will serve me for months and I will buy like this again!!"
1.0,nice flavor  but----,When my husband was told to restrict his sodium intake I bought Tony's salt free seasoning.  We like the way it flavors foods but we have both found there is something in it that causes us to sneeze and cough whenever we use it.  I have asthma and have had to use my quick relief inhaler several times when I used the product.  My husband is not asthamtic but it did cause him to sneeze and cough.  I don't what might cause this reaction but it happened more than once so I don't believe it was just a coincidence .
5.0,I'm in love,"The discovery of this product on Amazon has seemingly led me into a long term relationship with Go Picnic. I'm in love. These adorable and easily transported boxes are filled with high quality, interesting, great tasting foods. The meals are as balanced as they can be and I feel good about eating them. After buying this product I went on to order two other Go Picnic products, so I am very well-stocked for days I'm on the go and in need of food."
5.0,Can't get enough of this stuff....,"Our favorite rice blend by far, this mixture of brown rice grains is nutty and flavorful without any extra ""scents"" like jasmine, etc. or tastes that other grains could contribute.  Just plain old tasty, healthy rice.  Perfect with some stir fry or a roasted chicken breast.  Cooks well in the rice cooker."
5.0,Terrific product - may be better than Epigen,"I do an enormous amount of research before buying a kibble.  I have used other BB kibble formulas in the past and was very pleased.  Due to my dog becoming elderly I decided to switch to a kibble with an even lower phosphorous percentage (reducing load on the kidneys) than the BB Senior which is about .8%.  While BB does have a much lower phosphorous content than many kibbles I wanted something very low and Epigen (Wysong) is a low as it gets while maintaining a very high protein content from good quality meat sources.  Be aware that regulations only require the manufacturer to list the minimum amount of phosphorous and not the maximum.  One has to write the manufacturer to obtain that data.  So after months of research I bought some Epigen which is grain free, high protein, quality protein and starch free.  Eqigen has some patented process that removed the carbohydrates that I can't explain.  Eqipgen is 60% protein which is very high, but then older dogs need a good amount of protein that is easy is assimilate due to having reduced stomach acids.  But I wanted something to rotate with the Epigen that was not quite as high in protein and started reading about BB new Wilderness formula with a protein of about 47%.  Since the fiber content of the Wilderness is higher than Epigen the stools improved immediately.  I frankly don't know whether the Life Bits are credible or not, but the food is very good quality.  While neither product is as good as home made and/or the raw or BARF diet, these are both very fine kibbles.  Based on the improved stools I think I prefer that Wilderness over the Epigen and the later is more expensive.  Neither are cheap products.  Too both I've often added vegetables from SOJOs or canned tripe.  Tripe is the lowest phosphorous meat there is and Solid Gold make as good one canned if you chose not to order frozen, ground tripe.  As my dog ages further (now 11.5) I may have to give up kibble and move to frozen, ground tripe to continue to keep kidney disease from happening.  Since the huge increase of kidney issues in dogs appears to correlate with the advent of dry kibble, finding one that is low in phosphorous is, in my opinion, something of great importance.  And since dogs of GSD or Malinois size (med to large) reach senior status at around 5 years of age, the handler should start being concerned about diet and phosphorous at that age.  I train dogs in advanced obedience and K9 work and have seen how diet affects not only performance but health and longevity.  If you love your dog and wish it not to become ill from kidney disease please don't feed your dog crap from the super market.  You may think you are saving money, and yes dogs will eat just about anything because they are adaptive animals.  But a poor diet will catch up with you via medical bills eventually."
1.0,Like eat packing peanuts with flavored salt,"Maybe the other flavors are better, but the nacho cheese flavor was terrible.  Bless those who gave it 5 stars for they have no tastebuds."
1.0,Too sweet for me.,I have tried lots of GF snacks so I can be pretty picky but these were definitely too sweet for me to eat for breakfast.
1.0,Stale nuts,"I read a review, commenting that the nuts were stale.  I thought it might have been an one-time deal.  The nuts in my bars are stale as well.  The expiration is Feb 2013.  Even though grocery cannot be returned on Amazon, customer service refunded me without asking for return.  (When I checked at the store, where the bars have been fresh, the expiration is April 2013.)"
1.0,Sorry Kraft this  product is a total miss for me anyway,"Sampled this on my egg salad sandwich,I thought it might be good to try something new for a change. I thought wrong.  It doesn't taste like mayo. It tastes like a toxic mixture of cream cheese and vinegar that is off. I wouldn't have finished it if I hadn't been so hungry. Left a slimy taste in my mouth too."
1.0,Whoever is responsible for this product description is wrong.,"This product is NOT sugar free. The first item of the product description is ""hydrogenated glucose syrup"". Glucose IS sugar. I was supposed to have received a credit card refund and I am still waiting."
5.0,good stuff but real chicken is cheaper,"You can buy chicken in 10# bags for 5 to 7$ tops.  So thats about 32$ for 40 pounds of REAL meat. Boil it or bake it and now your dog has REAL food when you have some time to defrost it and give it to him.  Bones?  Chickens are like rubber now, and so are their bones. I have have had 100 years worth of dogs eat chicken bones and never have had a issue. I eat the bones too, so I know well..  Give them a good dog food, but look for the meat bargains at the big markets and your dog will live 14 to 20 years like my German Shepherds have."
5.0,More Than 5 Stars !!,"These granola bars are one word:  Addicting!  They have a real good crunch which if you wanted, you could break up and use as cereal and milk.  The almond butter flavor is out-of-this-world, and it's cheaper to get them here on Amazon than my local health food market.  I could eat these everyday!"
1.0,Dog lovers beware!,"My dog loves bones and was delighted to receive this tempting treat. She's a careful and thorough chewer, and I was amazed that she made quick work of the entire bone in under an hour. However, it made her VERY SICK! She has a tough stomach, but has vomited twice within 12 hours of eating it (that thing smells just as bad coming back up). BEWARE!! I will not be subjecting my dog to that experience ever again, and neither should you!"
1.0,WHAT?,"This is some kind of a joke, right?  Is this REALLY a $60 5 pound bag of flour? LOLOLOLOL  Only in America!"
1.0,Poorly shipped,The adapter was missing and one of the holders to the pot was missing and the package was ripped and poorly packaged and shipped. I returned it and was refunded.
1.0,order was cancelled-still shipped,I had cancelled this ship and save order but it still came. not real happy. thanks anyway guess every order has to be triple checked when cancelled
1.0,Underweight and not as described,The package I received is underweight with numerous empty wrappers. That is besides the fact that it seems like the expiration date has been changed.  Terrible experience.
1.0,Slight Chemical Taste,"I bought this from the local health food shoppe, but the mint flavoring tasted kind of chemical like so I threw it out. :("
5.0,Please give me another!,These little waffles are insanely delicious.  They are just the right amount of sweet and crunchy....I would eat one every day!
1.0,Not sweet.,"This brand of stevia is not sweet. I've tried numerous brands of stevia and this is not worth the price. I think it is because they add inulin instead of using pure whole stevia extract. I had to use twice as much as other brands to get the same level of sweetness.  If you want something sweeter, try the NOW brand Stevia powder or the whole foods 365 brand.  I used Amai's Super Stevia powder for years until they started adding INULIN to their products. Their stevia isn't as sweet anymore."
1.0,Tasteless Vanilla powder,"I don't know why Vanilla powder is so hard to find, except at Starbucks.  I wanted it for my coffee.  This product had very little taste.  I don't know how they managed that.  There has to be a better one around."
5.0,good food,".dogs were on blue buffalo they loved it but i thought i would try prairre chicken, because of the rating it got on dog food analysis,plus it was cheaper on amazon. with the automatic ship and free delivery it was a better buy. the dogs love this one also. will stay on it as long as it stays economical"
5.0,A BIT WORRIED,"I was a bit worried when I bought this three variety pack of nine loves food for my cats. I have four cats who live indoors and they have been spoiled with pricey wet food for a year: Newmans, Tiki, Fancy Feast and Pro Plan for starters.  As I began to go over my food budget I noted that the kittyies were eating veal and shrimp and I was dining on peanut butter and jelly. SO I decided to give this nine lives a try. My four indoor cats generally are fed six of the 3 oz cans of various cat foods at 5:00. They cannot be too hungry, because they have been looking askance at the likes of Chicken Tuscany and Turkey Primavera. I though I might look for more expensive foods to nudge their taste buds back into line, but after a financial check, I decided to find a less expensive brand which was tasty and met their high requirements for eating fare.  This Nine Lives have done the trick. The pieces of meet are actually cut into small chunkis that look quite delectable. The Turky, beef and chicken have all been enjoyed, though I DO get a questioning look from time to time.I also found the following food in 5.5 oz cans and they really lap THIS up Prairie Homestyle Chicken & Tuna Stew Canned Cat Food by Nature's Variety, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) . So I have determined that my finicky creatures can be fooled by a delicous type of food generally sold in the less expensive 5.5 ounce cans.  Gabriella, Triity, Wisdom and Mercy request that you give this to your kitty kids and feel that they will also be happy with it. When my ktties are happy, I am happy. So I also suggest this ""big time."" It is much cheaper than the little cans and stretches the grocrry budget quite nicely. I wish you the best on fining foods for the kitties! Amazon DOES make it easy!"
5.0,Excellent,"I am a Diabetic and also, at this time, cannot drive.  So, I am so glad that I can purchase many of my favorite grocery items on Amazon.  This Diet Cranberry Juice is wonderful and good for you. I also purchase Macro Greens Nutrient-Rich Super Food Supplement (wonderful for you) here on Amazon which I put in about a glass of cranberry juice.  It is great together.  That's the first thing I have in the morning.  Check that out also!"
1.0,AM I MISSING SOMEHTHING HERE?,I GOT THIS AND IT TASTED NOTHING LIKE EVERYONE ELSE SAYS IT DOES. MINE TASTED GROSS. IT HAS A BITTER AFTER TASTE AND DIDNT TASTE SWEET AT ALL. ACTUALLY IT WAS BETTER TO DRINK THE COFFEE BLACK INSTEAD.
1.0,The worst chocolate milk we ever tasted,"We buy a lot of chocolate milk for our daughters and prefer organic, but switch between different brands to save money. I got a case of Organic Valley Lowfat Chocolate Milk with a 15% ""Subscribe and Save"" discount, which made the price reasonable. These cartons looked convenient to include in the girls' school lunches.  So I did. Today. Both our girls came home with one request: NEVER EVER pack this HORRIBLE milk again!  I asked what was wrong, and the younger one (5 years old) said ""it was just not yummy"", while the nine year old proclaimed it ""the worst chocolate milk she had ever tasted"".  So I tried one myself and, sadly, have to agree: it looks and tastes like dirty water, NOT milk and definitely NOT chocolate! In fact it was so bad, that I had to rinse my mouth thoroughly after taking one sip :(  I'm not asking Amazon for a refund, since the product was delivered as advertized and the expiration date is 6 months from now. But I know for sure that I will never ever buy this again and will strongly recommend against it if you like the taste of REAL milk and REAL chocolate."
5.0,exquisite,This tea is absolutely exquisite! It is by far the most pleasant green tea that I've tasted.
1.0,crumbly and unuseable,This product arrived this week and was crumbly and unuseable.  I bought it due to the good reviews. Finding good gluten free bread is a challenge.  This one doesn't make the cut.  Buy only if you need bread crumbs.
1.0,Dangerous,"Like stated above, these are dangerous.  It's like giving your dog buffalo flavored glass. I didn't like how it was shattering while my dog was chewing on it, I decided to inspect a piece by breaking it with my fingers and sliced my finger open.  They might be fine for a small dog to nibble on, but my medium sized dog (38 lbs) shattered one of these things into pocket-knife-like shards within seconds.  Better off giving your dog cooked chicken bones."
1.0,not at all tasty,"Had no BBQ flavor at all, had a wax like texture and taste? Dollar tree sells better tasting peanuts. Wish I could get my money back. I Put it in the trash, eat less than .01%"
5.0,Fabulous,This is a fabulous drink.  And I was so pleased to find it uses an artificial sweetener.  I tried the Keurig brand of apple cider and it doesn't compare to this.  I give this 5 stars!
5.0,love it!,This ketchup is so good!I grew up on this stuff in germany and eat it with all the traditional things you eat ketchup with but its so much more and you can use it for so many different things. to add flavor and consistency. its thicker than regular american ketchup but trust me once you try this you wont want to go back!its not super spicy or hot it just has an amazing mixture of flavors
5.0,LOVE IT,"I love Celestial Teas because they are all natural so I'm a huge fan. I use this and mix it with Luzianne Sweet Tea over ice to give it a hint of Mint. I'm from the south and LOVE sweet tea and am very picky about it.   Luzianne Iced Tea, Family Size, 48-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) "
1.0,way too expensive,If you buy the capsules on nespresso's website they are much cheaper.  You are also able to choose which coffees you want per capsule.  This you are stuck with what they give you.  Nespresso sends theirs in 2 days also.
5.0,Best Cereal On The Shelves (When You Can Find It...),"I won't go into detail on how amazing this cereal is, because I feel the above comments say enough.  What I will enlighten the lovers of this cereal about is its current availability. I wrote to General Mills Corp about this cereal, and this is what a representative from their Consumer Services department came back with:  Thank you for contacting General Mills. Your comments are important to us.  We are committed to making a difference in the lives of our consumers. Feedback such as yours is important to the nature of our business.  The Count Chocula cereal is a seasonal product, available in the Fall. Please watch the store shelves this Fall for the product to return. The product has a long shelf life.

In summary: If you're looking for this cereal to resurface, keep your eyes on store shelves once the weather cools down and the leaves start to change colors."
1.0,MADE IN CHINA!,"Read the small print you will see the words 'MADE IN CHINA' - Ask yourself the question, would you eat a chicken product from China yourself? Be careful what you give your best friend, he trusts you. Now I am not one to want to hurt a companies products by bad mouthing them but I am not happy that I gave my dog chicken products from China, maybe by accident, I didn't see the small print (and it is VERY small print), as yourself the question too, if they made the words 'Made in China' bigger and on the front, would anyone buy this? If I am proven to be wrong I will be fair and remove this review but my Vitality chicken strips have the words 'MADE IN CHINA' in tiny print on the back."
5.0,finding the items we can't live without,Thank you Amazon.  When my local Natual Foods COOP failed financially last year I was lost in this rural community without many of the foods that had become a part of our daily life.  Twisted fruit is family favorite and Amazon is my favorite suppler.  This is a healthy pocket food for my teenager and a stuffer for my elementry son's lunches.
5.0,beautiful and delicious - a perfect gift,This is the second time I've sent this assortment as a gift and both recipients (one age 20 and one age 50) raved about the beautiful arrangement and the delicious taste of each and every piece of fruit.  Both times the present was shipped promptly and arrived exactly on time as promised and in excellent condition.
5.0,Hard to find,I used to buy the Mac and cheese just to get this product. I use it on my spaghetti and everywhere else that most people use parmesan cheese.  It is also great on popcorn.
5.0,Absolutely delicious!,"These have more net carbs than the Emerald Cocoa Roast almonds (6g vs 3g), but if you're not worried about that, these are absolutely delicious! If you like flavored nuts, you've got to try these."
5.0,Bee-licious,I received this golden delight as a Christmas gift.  This honey makes others pale in comparison!   The Savannah Bee Company Honeycomb Box 
1.0,Small does not begin to describe this one!,"Could not believe how small these baskets were...we were so deflated when we saw what they looked like & for what we paid for them...!  I would absolutely NEVER order from here again.  To give you some idea, this basket was probably about 7 inches high and not much wider...just couldn't believe it."
5.0,Cheetos are out.,"Michael Season's baked cheese snacks are in. I don't care if they may be inconsistent with the distribution of cheese on their product, big companies are inconsistent too. Your basketball players don't make every shot, your football players don't make every touch down. Are you whining at them or their coach? No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them. Natural Snacks LLC from Illinois is providing us with a healthier snack free from glutens and hydrogenated oils, and I'm thankful for that."
1.0,Complete Con,"This item clearly says Pack of 6 but it is not it is one pack.A complete and total con.No one in their right mind would pay this price for 1 pack of 9 cookies.And guess what,NON returnable. Amazon should be ashamed dealing with con artists like this."
5.0,These are so good,"Loved the Kind dark chocolate nut bar.  I would like to buy these again but I think they are just too expensive.  I realize they have good products in them, but just too pricy"
1.0,I will never use 1800flowers ever again,"I will never use 1800flowers again.  After paying roughly $450 for 3 arrangements for my grandmothers funeral, I felt the arrangements were poor in design with poor flower quality.  The company can blame this on the florist but I believe it shows the relationship that 1800flowers has with its florists and it's not a good one.  The card was hand printed with very poor handwriting, most of what I wanted on the card wasn't easily read and that was true for all three arrangements.  Nothing about the arrangements would even tell me which florist was responsible for fulfilling the order.  Another testament to a bad relationship with its florists.  Never again will I ever use or recommend 1800flowers.  No family member of mine, no friend I can convince, will ever use them again."
1.0,AWFUL!  Total waste of money.,"This stuff is horrid. It says it is Extra-Bold, but it is more like dishwater. It is so thin you can see through it and the flavor is lousy.  (Espresso is not only a strength, it is supposed to be a flavor. Not here!)  To be clear, I LOVE my Keurig machine. I use it happily with Newman's Own, Sumatra, and regular French Roast. So, while I do like strong coffee, I am normally happy with what is sold for this machine.  But now I am stuck with all these servings of stuff I am never going to use.  Even the Donuts decaf is better than this.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but this is the first time that I have been unhappy enough to write a review."
1.0,Taste is horrid,"I've tried several brands of almond milk and coconut milk (granted, I don't usually pay attention to if it's organic or not, this may one of the few organic options). I picked this up at the store as they were out of the coconut milk I usually get. This stuff tastes so bad, especially the smell. It has a faint smell of almonds, but a bitter soapy smell and tastes like soapy water. Maybe it's an acquired taste, but it was bad enough I wish I'd read a review first, and therefore thought I'd better leave one!  Also, this is the same stuff I tried, but they may have reformulated it (my package didn't look quite the same, and it said ""now with 25% less sugar"")."
1.0,Disappointed,"I read about the Brazilian coffee crop being excellent this year and wanted to try some.  I ordered medium roast for a drip coffee maker. The coffee I received was a very dark roast, almost espresso roast.  It was so finely ground that it overflowed my coffee maker making a big mess.  It was bitter as well. I am very disappointed in this product.[[ASIN:B001EQ52M0 Folgers Gourmet Selections Coffee, Brazilian Sunrise Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)"
1.0,Broke after several uses,"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!"
5.0,GoPicnic RTE meals are great!,Hummus meal is a favorite! Everything is good.  I sent a pack of 6 to my daughter.  She likes them for a quick lunch at work or when she can't get back to the dorm in time for dinner.  I like them anytime! Highly recommended.
5.0,WOW!,"I ordered the 6 pack even though the price was high just to try it.  It arrived last night and all the ice cream was still frozen if sitting on my porch all day...great packaging.  Anyway, I tried the chocolate peanut butter.  Of course, it's not as good as say a pint of Ben&Jerry's...but it was pretty good.  Good chocolate flavor, and enough like ice cream that your cravings are satisfied without all the fat and calories.  As a runner, I think I've found the perfect recovery snack after a long, hot summer run!  Lots of protein and some carbs as well.  I just wish it was more affordable."
5.0,Great sauce and shipping issues have been fixed,"I love this sauce. I've eaten it by itself, and periodically I add Trader Joe's turkey or beef meatballs, and it's always delicious. I keep it in my freezer, and I can have a ""home cooked"" sauce in minutes. Better than any jar sauce, and better than a lot of homemade and restaurant sauces I've had. Natural ingredients with just the right blend of flavors and no sugar added.  The Barely Bolognese and the Vodka sauces are my favorites in the Scarpetta line. I purchased a sampler for my first purchase, and all of them were excellent, but I've repurchased Barely Bolgnese, Vodka, and the Puttanseca sauces again.  I understand that they use to have some shipping quality control issues, but I think they have resolved the problems. I have never had any damaged shipments. The four heavy-duty plastic containers are packed in a very heavy cardboard box and is stabilized with a styrofoam sheet. Each container lid has a seal, and all of mine have been in tact upon arrival. This box is then put in an outer shipping box, and cushioned with air pillows."
1.0,Chocolate Chip Coconut Cookies not so yummy - but Amazon was great!,"I finally found my most favorite cookies through a dealer on Amazon.  After waiting nearly 4 weeks for them to arrive I finally contacted Amazon to let them know that I still had not received the cookies I ordered.  Two days later the cookies arrived - where they went before reaching me is still a mystery.  But I was happy to finally have them as I can't get them in Southern California.  The minimum order was 4 packages and that was okay, I would freeze some for later.  Much to my dismay the supplier just put the four bags of cookies and a box with NO packing to protect them.  So you guessed it....almost all of the cookies were broken into crumbs:  And to top it off the cookies ""best if eaten by date"" was only 2 days after I received them!  Needless to say these must have been sitting in a warehouse for quite some time.  After contacting Amazon I was able to get a refund for my crushed cookies.  Oh well, maybe I will try again by ordering with Amazon through a different vendor. Thank you Amazon - you were great."
5.0,Wintertgreen Gum,It is hard to find this flavor of gum in local stores.  The price is good and it lasts a long time.
1.0,Don't waste your money!!!,"These are the worst dried fruit I have ever had. I agree with all the other posts. These should have been slices and the taste left a lot to be desired. The Asian Pear and Apple are excellent. I have even had the banana and strawberry and they are a great chip replacement, but steer clear of this one and the peaches. Both are just awful!!!"
5.0,Mighty Tasty!!,"I most always order this flavor of Gloria Jean's coffee, which is Butter Toffee. I have ordered other flavors and I always come back to this one.I think if you will notice other reviews, they are also very good. I don't know what I would do without my keurig coffee maker and Gloria Jean's. I always look forward to a cup every morning. I have always ordered my flavored coffee from Amazon.com. I think their price is very good.The delivery is also prompt."
1.0,Cutter Advanced ...worthless,I am a fishing guide. I spend more time than most trying to ward off pesky misquitos. I have been useing cutter products with good success. I saw the reviews and decided to try the cutter advanced....Advanced means better right?...WRONG! ..Big Mistake!! This stuff is almost worthless. It may be better than nothing but I have apllied  3 times as much 5 times as often. Despite this..  I am continually being eaten alive by misquitos using this product. Its a wonder to me that it is still on the market? Do Not waste your money like I did.
5.0,Best Green Tea,"I purchased this tea the first time at China World at Epcot in Walt Disney World, Florda.  It was so great, we drank quickly in our house and was so pleased that Amazon offered it through its website. Wonderful green tea product."
1.0,Not a Jam!,"This may be tasty -- but is incorrect to sell it as a ""jam"". It is (as the label's French text correctly says, a ""Gelee"" or jelly. Real red current jam or preserves is a whole different thing!"
5.0,Highly recommend!,I'm a mother of four dogs and wanted to find some healthier treats than what I'd been giving them.  These salmon treats were a perfect find.  All four dogs devour them!  They are smaller (think big pencil erasers) but I still highly recommend.
1.0,"Caution, I was Glutened by MI-DEL Ginger Cookies",I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.  Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.
1.0,old product - don't purchase,These were yucky! An old product that should have been thrown away and used as a write off for the manufacturer. The expiration (Best used by) date was only two weeks from the date I received them. I had not thought to check the date until we tried eating them and ultimately had to throw away. Totally wrong to sell old product. Be careful!
1.0,Not satisfied,"I am personally not satisfied with this product. I would not buy it again, too much oil in it."
1.0,great concept; miserable construction,"I had this for 2 days before my dog rolled it off the couch onto a carpeted floor, which caused a 3-inch section of the brittle screw-on bottom to break off, rendering the toy useless--and potentially dangerous."
1.0,Beware of Bemka,"Ordered 2 jars of salmon roe. One was fine, the other was rancid. Bemka does not stand behind their products. When I complained, the manager said they can't afford to replace food items that are bad."
1.0,Panda has ruined their black licorice bars!,"As a longtime licorice connoisseur who has seen the quality of Haribo black licorice wheels fall off a cliff about five years ago, I was recently very upset to learn that the same thing had happened with Panda black licorice bars, which I used to enjoy on a daily basis. They no longer taste even vaguely like licorice, but rather like solid molasses, which is listed as one of the ingredients. Have shot Panda an irate online comment and predictably have not heard back. So, I have stopped eating Panda bars. (The upside: I've lost two pounds in a couple of weeks.) Licorice connoisseurs, let these penny pinchers know you notice the reduction/elimination of licorice extract from their products!"
1.0,way way way too dry,"I tried this jerky, loved the ""all naturalness"" of it. The taste is ok, but it's extremely dry and very tough and hard to eat. I will not buy this again."
5.0,Sensitive eater,"This is one of the few brands of dog food that actually makes my 13 year old 100 pound rottweiler feel good. He has very sensitive skin and the high dollar ""vet recommended"" brands just make his skin break out and itch all over . My dog was raised on all purina products , particularly Beneful ""original"". The fact that he is a breed that normally lives 8-10 years and he is 13 years old speaks volumes about the diet he was raised on. He has never been to the vet for those 13 years other than for vaccinations. I highly recommend Beneful original and healthy weight and healthy radiance brands. The active dog formula did however irritate his skin just like the expensive ""blue"" or vet recommended brands. Other than that , an endangered species animal research scientist , who was also a very close personal friend, recommended purina years ago because they found that to be excellent food for their animals (dog and wolf breeds included). Turns out that friends advice was wise and accurate."
5.0,"Green Mountain Pumpkin, k-cup coffee","I get this coffee from my elderly aunt who has a Keurig Brewer, and loves the brewer. She like a variety of coffees and teas. She really loves this Pumpkin Spice coffee. She says it's yummy. She likes it at night or really anytime."
5.0,Exactly what is claims to be!,"I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.  But beware - each can is only 8.3 ounces, a little more than a cup.  You decide if it's worth it."
1.0,chunky clam chowder,The product revealed itself to be incredibly small cans with hardly any clams or potatoes. I was really disappointed by price and the size.
1.0,worms found in fruit,"Recently, I purchased a can of Oregon Dark Bing Cherries. While making my jello recipe, I noticed strange elongated pieces in the jello after adding the bing cherries, which originally looked fine.  After fishing these pieces out, to my horror, they were worms. My advise to anyone using these canned cherries is, to cut them in half and examine them first before using them in a recipe."
5.0,A taste of Italy,So glad to have found this coffee online. My husband remembers it from his many trips to Italy so I got it as a gift and he was thrilled! Tastes great
1.0,Tasteless,"Very little taste (weak) and no caffiene that I can tell. I even emailed Tao of Tea about brewing suggestions, and got no reply."
1.0,"Product is great, Amazon's packaging is terrible!","I have been a Subscribe and Save customer for a few years.  Amazon has recently changed their packaging of this item.  For the second order in a row, I've received the case with a label on it.  There's no bubble wrap or larger box around it at all.  So what I have received is going to essentially be six boxes of cracker crumbs.  I'll be returning the order and canceling my subscription now.  I'd rather pay a higher price for a box of useable crackers than get a case of crumbs."
1.0,Gross - Like Eating Vaseline,"I'm on MediFast, and a number of people use Walden Farms products to keep their fat/carb/calories down.  Like an idiot, I went to the grocery store and bought about 8 or 9 of the products that were raved about -- IT WASN'T CHEAP!  This peanut spread is yucky. It is still in my fridge until I can think of something to do with it.  I don't want to waste it because it was expensive."
1.0,Unfit for scooping,"Tostitos scoops is a misnomer, these chips are unfit for scooping anything more than whipped cream. Out of ten attempts to scoop my 7 layer bean dip with these chips, only two were successful. And out of those two success stories one of them ended poorly when the Tostitos Scoop broke in half and lodged itself in my palate. I am sticking with the Frito Lay scoops, while traditionally used for chili I think they would do a better job than these sorry pieces."
1.0,terrible for your cats!,This is the worst food along with purina and meow mix that you could ever feed your animals! if you want your animals to have healthy weights and a healthy life do not buy!
1.0,Horrible,"The only good thing about this product was that it inspired me to search for better. I read that the recipe was changed recently, but that before that, it used to be decent. There are much better caviars to be found on Amazon, at similar prices."
5.0,Hot Hot Hot,This is my favorite potato chips from Lays.  They are no longer available in my home state.  I had to visit Lays website to see where they are sold.  I was so happy to see the Amazon had them on their website.
1.0,Terrible Stuff,"Mostly sugar and corn syrup.  Very little chocolate.  Go for the real thing, Hershey's cocoa powder and your own sugar!"
5.0,Good Buy!,"The season has a good flavor, good price, and I do plan to purchase it again."
5.0,Arrived as advertised,"Pez Candy is Pez candy, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I now have a very happy little Grandson who has enough Pez for his Nemo dispenser to last and last. The assorted flavors are a good idea."
5.0,Great Gift,"I purchased 5 of them for gifts during the Holidays.  Guess what, not one of them requested info to exchange or return them.  Most of them and their friends asked where they could get some."
5.0,ONLY FOOD MY CAT WILL EAT!,"This may seem a little expensive if you compare it to store brands like Friskies, etc. but if your cat is like mine it is worth it. No longer do I throw uneaten dried up food away...sometimes entire cans. He LOVES this stuff and there are no pesky fillers to get in the way. It is also good for thyroid health."
5.0,Maple Flakes,"The maple flakes were just what I thought they would be, they had great maple flavor for just a little bit and calories are not bad. I recomend using after cooking for best flavor. I added it to oatmeal while cooking and it wasn't enough so I added some extract. The next time I made it I added a sprinkle atop when in my bowl. Much better. I have also added it to vanilla yogurt, cinnamon toast, and cut apple slices for the kids. I love it. Shipped very fast too."
5.0,great variety of product,there is a great variety of teas in this item.  it gives a great overall chance to try the different teas without buying a whole box of a flavor only to find you may not like it.
1.0,Zero stars if I could,"This smells, looks and tastes like HAY - not like any tea, let alone green tea, not like Ginseng, and not like lemon. The weird smell is overwhelming!  I've never thrown out anything before, but this goes into the trash.  I cannot find a decent green tea from Amazon anywhere- I'm going back to importing my own.  This is the first tea I've rated below 2.5 stars- I would rate it a zero if I could.  Does not look like tea leaves, and it looks oxidized.  Maybe it's extremely old.  Maybe they gave me barn sweepings instead. Who would have thought green tea is so difficult to produce? Please take this off the market."
5.0,Great tasting water,"I'm on auto and I love my water.  Just wish it was a little bit cheaper, or IF they give discounts or free 6 pack with 4 orders, it would make thing a bit easier.  I will continue to get my Essentia as long as I am able to.  The water does have a lot of wonderful advantages.  I have fluid build up in my legs and sometimes my lungs because of my heart.  I had kidney failure, this water has helped me to be well hydrated and to keep my kidneys in working order.  The water goes directly where it is needed."
1.0,puppy didn't like,"Bought the big box to be economical..bad choice. My dog ate one reluctantly and then never ate another--and this was over months.  I gave them to a friend.  My friend who owns a dog store said that many dogs have digestive upset with these, so I'm not sad that my dog didn't like them."
5.0,Delicious crackers,"These All-natural honey-oat graham crackers are great.  They are nice and crisp, with hints of honey and cinnamon, that are pleasing without overpowering.  The fact that they have no artificial ingredients appeals to me, as well.  I like them very much."
5.0,too expensive but reliable,Because of Jacks high prices Ive shopped around.  Ive tried the cheaper brands and though I have found some that I like pretty good I dont enjoy them like I do Jack Daniels.  I cut out beer for a while and switched to just drinking whiskey and thats a pricey thing to do with Jack. I buy it by the pint and I pay 10.60 a pint for it.  The cheaper brands you can sometimes get 2 bottles for that but they aren't anywhere near as good.  I also tried bourbon (no thanks).  Despite its high price Id even take this over Bulliet.  I love that smokey taste.
5.0,"nice, healthy fern","The fern was packaged well and arrived in healthy shape, and was exactly as described. Would order from this vendor again!"
1.0,Moldy!,"Yuck!  Moldy. For the price, they should be mold free. I ate one before I noticed the mold, and it tasted good, but GROSS!  MOLD!"
5.0,just the right size package; great chips,Very nice chips; just the right size to serve with a sandwich and watch my calories.
1.0,Gluten Free Chicken base,"I was looking forward to trying this product.  Personally, I did not care for it.  It seemed grainy or pasty in my food.  Also, it seemed to take a larger amount to flavor my foods. I would not repurchase."
1.0,Bad Coffee,The artificial flavor was so overpowering the coffee tasted sour. Don't know is it because not optimized for coffee press. I really didn't like this coffee. I hate to be wasteful but I can't drink another cup of this. 95% of my purchase will be thrown away.
5.0,Amazing Product,"I will recommend this product to everyone who drinks wine or even those who just started to try wine.  This gadget can make a bottle of wine go down smoothly, it takes the ""acidity"" of the wine away and therefore, the wine taste very smooth when you drink it.  I am saying this because I'm not a wine drinker, but I can tell the difference when 2 glasses of wine was put in front of me to try, one glass of wine was pour through the Aerator and the other wasn't.  I was able to tell right away which one was lighter and smoother, and that was the glass of wine that was pour through the Aerator.  I love the product so much that I've bought the red and wine Vinturi Wine Aerator as a Christmas present for my in-laws this year.  The other thing that I forgot to mention is that it is a great product to take it with you as it comes with a travel pouch, you can definately show off to your friends and believe me, this will be a centre piece for conversation where the social gathering is."
1.0,Non-everlasting treat ball,"I bought this for my daughter's dog. He is a hybrid, probably Australian cattle dog and Jack Russell and weighs less than 40 lbs. It took him all of 2 minutes to figure out that he could get the large treat out of the ball by getting one canine tooth under the edge and pulling. The second one came out even faster! The treats themselves did take him about 5-10 minutes to eat. As far as entertainment value and boredom relief while in his kennel? I couldn't even give it to him in the kennel because the ball itself was too easy to chew up once the treats were out of it.  Not impressed, not worth the money, doesn't do what it's advertised to do, won't bother ordering more of the treats to fit it as they are quite expensive and I can keep him entertained longer with a Kong or Nyla Bone. Modification in design so the treat doesn't pop out so easily might fix it, but at this point, for the price, don't bother.  Waste of 20 bucks."
5.0,Perfect healthy snack for kids!,"My kids are addicted to candy (like most other children) and tend to shy away from fresh fruit when I try to put fruit in their lunch boxes but they ABSOLUTELY LOVE these apple and cherry natural fruit bars. To them, they tastes like candy, but I know how guilt free these fruit bars are, which makes me a happy mom. My kids have at least one a day which satisfies their required daily allotment for fruit and saves me time in washing, peeling, and cutting fruit. These bars are a terrific fresh fruit substitute for our crazy busy lifestyle!"
1.0,Pine nut syndrome?,"I wouldn't have believed it, but in Googling for a cause of the recently acquired bitter aftertaste I've been experiencing, I found an article about pine nuts causing this, and it's even being called a syndrome, which can occur a few days after consumption.  One writer suggested the culprit is pine nuts from China, which these are.  I hope the taste will be gone by Christmas, after which I hope to try making pesto again with Italian pine nuts, or see if I can find some grown closer to home.  I suppose this could be some form of allergy, but just in case, I thought other pesto enthusiasts would like to know."
5.0,It's great,"In Mexico last fall, I learned the wonders of Flor de Jamaica. It is fabulous from both a health and taste perspective--and no caffeine. I drink it all the time and the concentrate makes it so easy. Just add water."
5.0,Tasty and effective,"I use Gu for cycling and get a step function performance difference, starting at 9-12 minutes after ingestion, then ending 20-40 minutes later (20 minutes for hills, 40 for flat roads). Very effective for whatever ails my energy system."
1.0,Worst tomato sauce I've tried,"This sauce is very strange tasting with a lot of spice. I was going to use this as the base for a pizza sauce, but not even huge amounts of sugar / honey could save this sauce.  It also starts off very watery (not good value for your money). I will never buy this tomato sauce again."
1.0,dented,Happy to find a BPA free can filled with a good product.  Disappointed that more then 1/2 are always badly dented.  Have not rec'd a case without some type of dents in most of the cans even though the packaging was perfect and items secure.
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THIS,This is a false advertisement. They will send you one dog bone.  I am currently awaiting a response from the company.
1.0,"Possibly bleached, and texture is off","Soaked in cold water for 8 hours, REPEATEDLY cooked in zojirushi rice cooker on porridge setting for 4 cycles (about 2 hours), still no signs of cooking into the normal Yiner (silver ear) texture, where the fungus should become slimy and porridge-like, which in this case, is desirable. This is worrying because yiner IS TOXIC once it is left for long periods of time (~12 hrs) as it begins to release HNO2. Color is also unnaturally white, while yiner that I am used to is more of an elephant-tusk off-white, suggesting that the lack of texture may be from bleach"
1.0,gross,I bought this rice because of the reviews that said how good it was.  WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This junk is nasty!!!!!!!
1.0,"WAY, WAY, WAY OVERPRICED","My wife, just today, bought a 12 oz pkg of this at our grocery story for $8.50. The cost here seems like price-gauging."
5.0,Great stuff,"I get this sugar for my husband who has diabetes.  He loves it in his coffee.  If you take two teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, you only need one teaspoon of this stuff.  I heard that the other artificial sweeteners mess with your kidney eventually, and this product does not.  There is no aftertaste and it improves the taste of coffee.  I drink it also, and prefer it to sugar."
5.0,excellent coffee,works in k cup with no problem. good value. almost gave up on k cups due to cost. now with this alternative will keep using it.
1.0,Makes me wanna puke!!!,Boy are these bad!  Bit into the first one. Pasty stuff inside with a slightly crunchy cover.  Spit it out immediately. They taste like some unidentifiable chemical and smell bad.  My dog ate a few small bites I cut off then refused any more.  I feel bad donating these to the food bank but off they go.
5.0,love this product,"i love this brand, it smells and taste so good, well worth it. i put it in my toddler son's milk as an extra booste to his nutrition and he loves it. Good for hair and skin too; great all around for health."
1.0,Wouldn't recommend....,"This rice looked good in the package and seemed simple enough to make, so I thought I'd try it.  I shouldn't have.  It tasted like the plastic bag it came in.  My two year old tried it, and it literally made him throw up... :("
5.0,Great!,I am not the most experienced of cooks and haven't worked with soup/ stock cubes before. I experimented with making my own stock which took forever and was never as flavourful as I hoped for.These cubes now make my soups delicious!!
1.0,"Beware, this is not 100% not from Concerate....","Amazon, please review your lisiting for this product, this is not what the picture is. Otherwise it is a apple juice. I love amazon....it's not for amazon, but for the product."
1.0,NOT Pumkin Spice Coffee,"Just tried this Pumkin Spice Coffee.  Spouse said it left an after taste.  I couldn't taste the Pumkin -- the only reason to buy Pumkin Spice coffee.  Label says its Low Acidic -- that's a plus if the coffee was better.  Bean Coffee Engineer's have some work to do on this Pumkin Blend.  PROBLEM:  We got use to GODAVIA, Pumkin Spice Coffee which is the VERY VERY BEST!  Unfortunately it is also $$$$$ VERY Pricey."
5.0,Best tea for the ol' Brown Betty,While living for a month in Scotland in a self catering we had settled into this tea from the Co-Op as our favorite. When we returned to the states we put away our coffee machine and went with pots of tea for breakfast. Great stuff! The longer you steep it the fuller the flavor ... max about 8 minutes. Brought home 4 boxes in our suitcases. The tea was so good we donated clothes to the local charity to make room for it. When we got back to the states and ran out we replinished our supply with Amazon ... thanks for being so global Amazon! :-) Cheers!
5.0,love!,This is by far our son's favorite flavor! They dissolve nice and are the perfect first finger food! They taste great and smell good too.
1.0,Little more than sugar syrup,"Just Sweet, no flavoring that I could taste. While not expensive for what it is supposed to be, real expensive to use as sugar syrup. Guess I'll stay with Carnation flavored creamer. Altho I really don't like to give Nestle anything."
5.0,Salsa Verde,"I was very pleased with this salsa.  Nice flavor, enough spice to fee like you got some, but not too much."
1.0,Crunch warning!,"Beware...the ""Crunch!""  is for real.  So real, I broke a tooth eating the stuff.  It seemed good, maybe I received an over cooked batch.  Too scared to try it again.  It has ended up being the most expensive cereal I ever purchased:("
5.0,Great gummies for great value,"This is my favourite brand of gummi bears, and the price it cost me for 12 packs of these is such a great value. I would definitely recommend."
5.0,pancakes,I love this mix for pancakes the best. The recipes on the back of the bag have all worked out well!
1.0,NOT BPA FREE!!  Enough to make you flip your lid!,"As you can see, the company has a prominent PBA FREE CAN seal on the label.  If you look closely, perhaps with a magnifier,  you will see an tiny asterisk after the word ""CAN"", however, there is no corresponding asterisk on that side of the box.  On the back of the box, in an inconspicuous place, at the bottom, underneath the recycling information and the larger print address and email address, in tiny print you will see ""*lid not included. Obviously the company believes it is important for consumers to know if their product is BPA free, as they clearly state it on the front of the box in LARGE LETTERS, so isn't it deceptive that the description does not apply to the lid, which is indeed part of the can?  Even if I were not concerned about ingesting BPA, I still would not support a company that would intentionally mislead their customers, especially in matters of health and safety."
5.0,great meal supplement,"These are my favorite of all protein bars.  They aren't overly sweet, taste delicious,  totally fill me up and are gluten free.  I usually eat one for breakfast and am not hungry for 3-4 hours afterwards.  Lots of protein too."
5.0,Best crackers around,"These are the best tasting crackers that I've tasted in years. They hold up in humid weather and are great for both parties and everyday soups and dips. They are also great for the special diet folks - no dairy, low sodium."
5.0,Spicy Chocolate - YUM!,This chocolate is delicious!!  My husband loves spicy foods and this chocolate completes his search for the ultimate food - spicy chocolate that is nutritious!
5.0,Super fresh and delish!,I love macadamia nuts. This order arrived quickly and they are very fresh. Will order these again very soon. We can't stop eating them.
1.0,Not what I expected,"Ordered this to go into a recipe that we had brought back from Peru.  Never tasted Chicha in Peru, so this might be the real deal and okay by other's standards.  Nonetheless, I found it pretty nasty tasting and can't see that it added anything positive to the Peruvian stew that I made."
1.0,If only I could leave no stars....,"Escargot lovers, beware! These escargot are very sandy/silty. I tried rinsing and soaking them, and the sand would not come off. Terrible. Stick with Roland Giant snails if you want a decent, consistent product."
1.0,bad,Don't waste your time with this. The only good part was the cups!The cake itself didn't bake properly in the cup.
1.0,Should be called USER B GON !!,"As others have said,  the valve pops off and sprays everywhere.  Hopefully it's only water and you are not getting sprayed with residual Bug B Gon  Horrible !"
5.0,"Excellent Product, Fast Shipping","Scott's Cakes contacted me after receiving my previous order.  Representative was pleasant, and wanted to know how they could improve.  They did what was recommended and my next shipment came on time and without melted chocolate!!!  Thank you Scott's Cakes for providing my family with delicious products and excellent customer service!!!"
1.0,Sent Snack Pack instead of Handi-Snacks,I received Snack Pack instead of Handi-Snacks.  I prefer Handi-Snacks because it has a much better flavor than Snack Pack even though its consistency is slightly looser.  I was really disappointed since it's so difficult to find Handi-snacks but it didn't seem worth the trouble of returning.  I won't be ordering this product from amazon in the future.
5.0,Best way to buy vanilla beans,"After a local store (where I used to buy five beans for around $10) closed, I thought ""why not check online"" since I am buying more and more things that way. I found this place through Amazon and took a chance at getting a pound of beans. They arrived quickly and are absolutely beautiful! I may have underestimated how many vanilla beans are in a ""pound,"" as this is more than I need for now. So I've repackaged and sealed them to save for later. (You can separate them into smaller amounts and double-bag them in those Ziploc vacuum bags. They'll last forever. Even when they are no longer at their peak, you can still use them for flavoring.) I'm very happy with the purchase and the quality of the beans and will probably only buy from this place from now on. Good job, Vanilla Products USA!"
5.0,Very satisfied user!,Agave is a great sugar substitute/sweetener and I really enjoy using it.  I have cut my sugar use by half in southern sweet tea!  This is the best supplier/price I have found.
1.0,"Tastes Good, just brewing issues","I've read several other similar stories so I'll keep it short. Not every Pod is bad, but enough are bad that I've cancelled my Subscribe and save order. I don't want to keep dealing with the brewing problems. The few pods that have worked actually made great tasting coffee. We purchased the medium roast and the decaf, same issues with both."
1.0,Crazy price hike,"Great deal at about $11.  I bought a bag and subscribed for scheduled delivery.  Then a couple of weeks later, the price jumps to $17.92, well over the cost locally. Canceled any future deliveries.  Nice dog food, crazy way to do business, Amazon."
5.0,Great taste,I was looking for a light cookie/biscuit to have with tea in the afternoons that was low in calorie and sugar.  I naturally went to Sprouts (formerly Henry's) looking for this first since they have all the natural items.  I picked these up to try thinking that I liked the taste of honey gram plus they were 100% percent natural and 14 pieces has just 130 calories.  All criteria's were met.  Later that night when I had them with tea I also loved the flavor.  I'll be a regular buyer now.
1.0,If It Ain't Broke . . .,"Add me to the list of long-time, loyal Cafe Francaise drinkers who are devastated at this change and will not be buying the new formulation.  Whichever Kraft product consultant pitched this idea should be fired.  The new taste is awful."
5.0,great treat,My dog loves Zuke's treats and this one is no acceptation. He did not like them as much as the chicken but they still keep his interest. I will be cutting them up to use at puppy class. Zukes are the only thing other than hotdogs that will get his attention.
1.0,Not enough information,"I considered buying this product but didn't because there was no nutritional informtion provided.  When will manufacturer's learn that the majority of food buyers want to know calories, sodium content, etc. BEFORE they buy.  As soon I know this information is NOT available, I assume the product info isn't good."
5.0,Delicious,"Maybe the other reviewers got a bad batch, I don't know, but this chili is super good.  It's got a great kick and is just the right consistency.  You can add chopped-up steak to this too, and it's great!!"
5.0,Excellent chocolate,"With all the publicity regarding health benefits of dark chocolate, Vivani is one of the best I've tried. It has a creamy, full-bodied taste that is definitly chocolate. The ingredients are organic and each bar has 72% cacao. For someone who enjoys dark chocolate, Vivani tastes too good to believe that it provides health benefits."
1.0,"Disappointing....  Strong, unpleasant flavor","We were excited to try this new flavor because we enjoy the variety of all the various K cups.  But... unfortunately,  neither my husband or I like the flavor.  I have to agree with another poster that it tastes burnt to me."
5.0,great deal,"I give this 4 stars for the taste (solid) and 6 stars for the organicity and price(are you kidding me?)..I have a suggestion for preparation..I empty out about 6 bags into a 4 cup measure cup and microwave while stirring once for around 5 min on high..then I strain (and microwave) whenever needed..the tea this way is a bit different..first, it's REALLY green, got to think that more of the good stuff (catechins, polyphenols,etc) are in there..second, the taste is more well-rounded(think robust and ""warm"").."
5.0,"A bargain, and smells great!","Vanilla beans have many uses: you can make vanilla sugar, creme brulee, and many other desserts. You can also make vanilla extract. And if you buy these beans, you can do it all at a fraction of the supermarket price.  Yesterday I priced two vanilla beans in a spice bottle at the supermarket. They cost almost $6. This half pound package of beans that comes in a vacuum pack contains at least 50 beans and cost only $25. I am not quite sure what I will do with all of these, but we did make some bottles of vanilla extract for our favorite cooks for Xmas, and I have vanilla sugar in my cupboard now. The fragrance of these beans is marvelous, but I have resealed the package so the beans won't dry out. I may even put a few beans on the counter to make it smell like I have been cooking!  A recipe:  1 cheap fifth of vodka 10-12 beans, sliced the long way.  Remove a cook's share from the vodka bottle and replace with the beans. close the bottle. Let sit for at least a month in a cool dark cupboard.  Decant some of the vanilla into a smaller bottle when you need a refill. Put another sliced bean in there, and top off the large bottle with more vodka. Use the smaller bottle for your cooking. Make lots of cookies!  You can keep this up for about a year."
5.0,tea,"Almost taste like black tea. Very nice tea, but what is better than other tea is that this Pu-erh tea doesn't upset your stomach like black or green tea does to me.  I am glad to have found this tea."
1.0,burns the skin off your lips,"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
5.0,"Really good, Nostalgia returns.","I haven't eaten cornuts since the 90s, those were the golden days yes they were, things were so innovative and tasteful. One of the many things I ate as a kid in school was cornuts, friends would share them, trade flavors for other flavors it was just something everyone had in their sack lunch, and if they didnt they tried trading there most valuable lunch food for a bag or a small handful of these gems. Today you don't hear about them at all, they rarely sell the assorted flavors like they have online, I was surprised to say that the cornuts I recieved were not rotton, spoiled, or taste bad in any way, (well except for the originals which I dont care for anyway). The pack comes with original,ranch,bbq,chili picante. They all taste good, but there are more originals in the pack and very few ranch,bbq,chilie picante."
5.0,Great Snack!,"I really enjoy these.  I eat them for breakfast and for snacks throughout the day.  I especially like them since I usually don't feel like eating in the morning, but these go down easy and get my day started right."
1.0,Not Gluten Free.,"Spelt is an ancient form of wheat.  It's not gluten-free.  If you have celiac, are cooking for a celiac, an autistic or Asperger's syndrome kid, or someone with anything on the gluten sensitivity spectrum, look elsewhere.  Spelt is NOT gluten-free."
5.0,Love these!,"My son is allergic to a lot of different things. This is the sucker replacement I found for him and he LOVES it. I think they taste way better then conventional suckers, and I don't have to feel guilty about my kids getting  a treat now and then. We all love them, they are colorful and fun. I am grateful for such a great product!"
1.0,Bad Aftertaste,Don't buy this stevia.  It has a bad aftertaste.  Now I find that I can't return it AND it comes in a 2-pack.  YUCK!!!
1.0,Inedible,"This is the first review I have ever written on Amazon. I wish I had read the reviews before I tossed $14 down the commode. These are the most terrible tasing things I have ever put into my mouth. The texture is gritty, there is no taste except excessive salt. How can cheese, which I LOVE, be made to taste this bad? The only thing good about them is the smell. They smell like butter but taste like %@&#. One handful and the rest were flushed. I will definitely check the reviews before buying any more food products on line."
1.0,We got a hard batch- will not try them again,"I guess we got a stale batch- the product was still supposed to be good, according to the ""sell by"" date.  This was the worst dried fruit product I have ever had.  It was very tough- like real leather, instead of fruit leather.  We like the Cliffs fruit ropes, and the Target organic fruit leather (always soft and delicious), and I will never take a chance on this brand again."
1.0,"Package NOT Marked ""Tellicherry""; NO SKU or ASIN #","Received zip-lock bag of black peppercorns.  Label from MoreThanAlive.com merely lists ""Black Peppercorns"". No way of telling whether these are Tellicherry, or just their bulk black peppercorns. MorethanAlive's website makes NO mention of Tellicherry.  Just Black Peppercorns, in bulk, for $4.80.  I ran out of pepper and don't care for a three week wait for a refund.  But I will never order from this company again.  BUYERS BEWARE !"
5.0,husband savers,I order these every 2 years for my husband and he just loves them.  They come promptly and well-packed.  thanks very much.
5.0,Great.,"Comes with 6, bring 1 to the theater with you. Tastes good, it really adds to the bland flavor of regular popcorn. The best of the Kernal Season's flavors imo.  Haven't tried it on anything else. They have other flavors for that."
5.0,"Jelly Belly's are the best, even the belly flops","So far above other jelly beans you wouldn't even call them the same thing.  The flavors are surprisingly similar to their name sakes.  The only downside to Jelly Belly is the high price, which is why I bought the belly flops in 5 bags of 2 pounds each. If you are going to do it- do it big."
1.0,weak!!,"The peach taste in this tea is way too weak. What peach? What tang? Just a super sweet, some kinda pale indistinguishable fruit stuff in a watered down tea. won't buy again."
1.0,Contains MSG,"My son loves Hot Cheetos and we try to minimize his consumption of junk food. On special occasions we will let him eat them, and over the past 2 times he has thrown up this red liquid afterward. He says he feels immediately better. The first time we figured he had a flu bug and he didn't eat the hot cheetos for weeks. Yesterday he came home from camp and as a special treat we let him eat some on the way home. Needless to say he threw up the same red stuff after his chest was burning and stomach hurt. The ingredients say they contain monosodium glutamate so MSG. Parents beware if your child has done the same with specifically the ""hot"" brands of chips . Cheetos Flamin' Hot Crunchy 2.0 oz (Pack of 5)  Flamin' Hot Mix - 30 ct  Flamin' Hot Mix - 30 ct "
5.0,Healthy Food,Thank you for offering a product I cannot find locally and which greatly aids my health.
5.0,the fatty,Great product!  interested in why it was removed from store shelves. seems to fulfill reqirements as far as diabetic rules.
5.0,"Cat's favorite treat, good price..",My mom's elderly cats adore the Original Crunch favor of these treats but they are very difficult to find around here for less than $1.80 a pouch.  We buy them 20 pouches at a time (so they qualify for free shipping) and have them sent right to the house.  Very convenient for everyone.
5.0,HOT,yeah it was what it claimed. super hot. loved it. played pranks on people and they hated me for it. when i run out imma get me another one. sweeeeet.
5.0,Tastes like sugar,"The Zveet Birch Xylitol tastes like sugar, looks like sugar, and works in recipes just like sugar. I used to just omit sugar from recipes that called for a tablespoon or so, but with this xylitol I go ahead and add it. I've also tried it sprinkled on fruit, sweetening whipped cream, and in homemade hot chocolate. The only thing it seems to lack is the resulting sugar crash that consuming regular sugar used to cause me. And that's a good thing!"
5.0,High grade Coca!,"Excellent product.  Individually wrapped, high quality leaves.  Plus a bonus bag of unwrapped tea to steep any way you like."
1.0,WHAT?!,"$13 for 4oz, FOUR OUNCES??? I don't think so. No jerky is worth over $3 an ounce. I like to stay around $1 an ounce if possible. I suggest Wild Ride Sweet n Spicy or Black pepper flavor"
1.0,way too costly for small packafe of cookies. !00g pkg for 5.98 per pkg.,I must be careful in the future.  I have been very pleased with all my other Amazon orders.  This was way too costly for small amount you receive. Also the cookies weren't real fresh. No more orders  of this cookie.
5.0,Yummy!,"This stuff is fabulous!  I have ordered several spices from these folks on Amazon, and couldn't be happier!  Each transaction has been perfect."
5.0,when you just can't find what you want on grocers shelves,"never could find butterscotch on grocers shelves in the jello brand  , could find royal.  it is great to have the jello brand butterscotch pudding.  brings back childhood memories"
5.0,K cups,Timothy's hazelnut flavored decaf coffee K cups are the best coffee I've made with my Keurig Brewer.  Really delicious and decaf!
1.0,"Great food, wrong picture","The picture for this product is the 14 pound bag.  However, this product is a 4 pound bag.  Easy to tell you are buying a 4 pound bag when you are on a computer, but not a mobile device.  So I was very surprised when I received a the 4 pound bag."
5.0,"fremont, ca"," Bob's Red Mill Red Lentils, 27-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)   I've enjoyed most of Bob Red Mill's products.  His products are guaranteed nutritious, high quality,and very healthy.  I'm a frequent buyer of his products, such as wheat gluten, lentils, whole wheat flour, etc...  If you've never tried his products, you should try some and you'll discover that his products are true to his philosophy.  Would definitely buy again and again."
5.0,So delicious,"This is some of the best I have tried.  The flavor is so light, yet so delicious.  My kids want to eat this instead of butter.  So excited to have found this."
1.0,Doesn't work very well.,I am on my fourth  application and the vine still isn't totally gone.  Not very effective. Try another product even if it appears to cost a bit more.
5.0,Best Chai I've ever had.,"And I've had a lot of Chai. This is so good, a perfect mixture of spices, a creamy taste and smell. Honestly, I just sit there sometimes and take a whif and and taken away into a delicious heaven. A must have if you are a chai lover!"
1.0,You will fail a drug test!,"I have no comment on taste, but My closests friend just lost his case against the FAA, after failing a drug test for cocaine (we were both given some of this brand of tea he ordered on Amazon) which stated that this is considered an illegal substance by DEA guidelines, as it is made from coco leaves. Nearly $20,000 in legal fees has proven that you drink this tea and take a drug test you will have no grounds to fight it. Buying it from Amazon was no defense! Enjoy it if you don't have to worry about drug testing, but if you have any concern, steer clear."
1.0,"40 packet's 80, or what?","144 80 count boxes  at normal street price would be only $900-1000 tops anyway and not  the claimed $1,300 this so called sale of $1,149 is a scam."
5.0,Yummy coffee,The french toast flavor is a new treat for my taste buds. Since I drink my coffee black I need an outstanding taste to love it with no sugar in it. This one really delivers!
5.0,Very Happy,This specific tea is getting very difficult to find in my smaller market area so I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon.  The product arrived in great shape and very quickly.  Thanks!
1.0,medocre tea,"I love blooming teas & lavender. I can accept a poor tea with a beautiful blossom or vice versa, but this had neither. The tea was ok but the aroma was like old lavender buds that you would find in the bottom of a linen closet. The flower looked like a drab green urchin with no pretty blossom in the center like the picture. I'll stick with my Primula tea from now on."
1.0,"DO NOT BUY, SAVE YOURSELF HASSLE, CRAZY $$$","The raisins are great, the Problem is, this is supposed to be 12 packs of 6 boxes, or 4.5 lbs, (see shipping weight) for a total of 72- 1 ounce boxes. They sent me two packs of 6 boxes, for a total of 12 boxes which is 12 ounces, which is about $2.66 an ounce (YIKES). The product specifically states, 44 cents an ounce! which is right if they had sent all 72 boxes. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE, they KINDLY sent me another order, which also arrived with only 2 packs of 6-1 ounce boxes. HOW FRUSTRATING! The customer service people were in Jamaica, and were very hard to hear, but were very nice, and helpful, but, they have no control over the people at the warehouse. VERY SAD DAY FOR AMAZON, BE WARNED!  Sun Maid California Golden Raisins (1-Ounce), 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 12) "
5.0,Excellent ground coffee,I like a smooth rich cup of coffee.  The Melita Blanc et Noir delivers.  It's one of the best ground coffees that I've purchased and is easily comparable to coffee from one of the better specialty stores.  The coffee arrived vacuum packed and tightly sealed.  At $0.55 per ounce ($8.80 per pound) it's also competitively priced.  Strongly Recommended.
1.0,"Bad, do not buy","My fence quit after a week when the first storm hit.  Of course there was no warranty against storms. Plastic fence posts were very flimsy and had to dig holes to bury them.  Do not buy, money wasted."
1.0,Product of China,I don't trust foods from China.  You purchase something organic and pay more for it only to find it's made in China!
5.0,WTF????!!!,"Love the product, but why did the freaking price just jump up by about $10!!!"
1.0,disappointed,"Let me start by saying my dog weighs 24 lbs but should be 17 lbs. I make this point because she is overweight and will eat anything.I purchased these treats because they are low calorie, all natural and had great reviews. I tried for 3 days but she wouldn't eat even 1 little morsel.Obviously I was disappointed and also shocked like I stated she's 7 years old and will eat anything. Maybe the bag I received was stale but wasted my money and tossed into the garbage."
5.0,Great coffee - fash delivery !,"I love this coffee, its the best I have every had. Delivery was really quick."
5.0,HEY- IT'S REAL BUTTER AND GREAT ON STEAKS,"For all you folks who say that it doesn't taste like butter- GET REAL. This is nothing more than clarified real butter. The difference between the two is that melted butter will make the popcorn soggy. O'Dells won't. Yes, it is more expensive than making your own, but the convenience is worth it to me. After I pop my corn in my commercial popper, I can stick a tub in the microwave and pour it over the popcorn-return the tub to the refrigerator (not necessary). I truly believe that quality  popcorn with O'Dell's Popcorn Butter is as good or better than any theater popcorn I've had. If you say it doesn't taste like your melted butter, you are probably comparing it to melted ""salted"" butter. If you like your ""salted butter"",  use a very small amount of FLAVOCOL.  HOWEVER, My favorite use of O'Dell's is on steaks. I sear my ""CHOICE"" steaks on the highest heat (3-4 minutes) after coating them only with a nothing more than a little olive oil, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper. I place a small amount of O'Dell's in the bottom of the plate, then drizzle a small amount of O'Dell's on top of the steak. Cover with tin foil and let it rest for at least 8 minutes (it will absorb the butter). If you like your steak medium to well-done, stick them covered in the oven at 400-500 degrees.I like mine med-rare, so mine don't go in the oven. I would compare my steaks to any of the top steak houses and all my guests agree. Steve"
1.0,Bad,Today is oct 19th but due date is nov 2nd. 30 bags eat in 13 days ?!  So useless. do not buy it
1.0,Almond Butter,"I bought this almond butter at Costco. It tastes like the plastic jar it comes in, not like almonds. It's so runny that I had to eat over the sink. I will stick with peanut butter from now on."
5.0,My ONLY Coffee!!!,"I use these coffee pods in my 5 cup coffee maker, I usually put one coffee pod in the basket and add 4+ cups of water and ""presto, perfect coffee"" - I only use senseo medium blend, I watch where ever they are on sale but I found these at Amazon cheaper than any others at the stores. These are the only ones I use after trying many others. I give it MY #1 Rating and the only one I use anymore."
1.0,Horrible,"This is the unholy combination of dried apricots, inner tubes, and fig newtons.  Avoid at all costs.  Also, there is no satisfaction policy from manufacturer - just instructions explaining how to store their food products.  Check out the manufacturer website.  I'd recommend the cherry flavored bars as the those do taste somewhat like cherry pie."
1.0,Could barely get through 2 sips..,Should have read more about the contents before ordering. I agree that more than Keurigs it tastes like the instant coffee that you get at rest stops. Really disappointed.
1.0,Kona Coffee; you've got to be joking!,I am a big sucker for coffee; especially Kona and I try to to taste every brand I get. Hawaii Roasters is absolutely the worst I have tasted so far (Just in case you are wondering my favorite is Koa Peaberry). This one doesn't have even the slightest characteristics of Kona Coffee. If you don't want to spend a small fortune on good coffee; just go with blended Kona. You will save some money over this brand yet still will get a better taste.
5.0,Love this Tea!!!!! My favorite - better than any coffee!,I love this tea!  It's spicy and wakes me up in the morning without feeling like I'm drinking something unhealthy.  Plus it's filled with antioxidants so this is good for my health too!  I only wish they'd put it out in K-cups so i can use it with my Keurig coffee maker - which I'm shamelessly plugging as the next best thing on earth!
5.0,You're never too old to enjoy graham crackers.,"Possibly, many Americans are familiar with Nabisco's Honey Maid graham crackers. The configuration, shape, size, and flavor, of these crackers has been standard for decades. While I do not have any Nabisco's graham crackers on hand right now, for a side-by-side comparison, I can easily remember the characteristics of this product.  Now for the review.  The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers comes in a box of moderate size. I was surprised by its heavy weight, that is, by its density. The BACK TO NATURE crackers seem a bit crisper and crunchier than the Nabisco product which, in my opinion, is somewhat soft and gets softer with storage. Crunchiness is generally considered to be a good thing (though the excessive crunchiness of food products such as Almond Roca can cause damage to teeth and to fillings and such). Even though I received the BACK TO NATURE products in the mail, there was very little breakage. I can conclude that the BACK TO NATURE graham crackers are a sturdy product, and will not likely be broken when toted in a plastic container by your kids, on the way to school.  The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers are distinguished by the flecks of light-colored bits of oatmeal, which are baked into the top surface. In fact, the color photograph on the box shows a stack of three crackers with an abundance of oats adhering to, or baked into, the top surface of the crackers. This is another good thing.  The BACK TO NATURE oat graham crackers have a dotted line that bisects the cracker, to make it easy to divide the cracker into two equal halves. This dotted line is not effective in the BACK TO NATURE product. Instead, the cracker always breaks just to the side of the dotted line, leaving you with two halves, but where one half is slightly larger than the other half. But this is neither good nor bad, unless you have a need to break the crackers into two equal halves, for example, for manufacturing a peanut butter sandwich.  The BACK TO NATURE package label discloses that one serving contains 110 calories, 2.5 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbohydrate, and 2 grams of protein. The box informs us that one serving is 2 full cracker sheets.  Now, let us compare this with the standard Nabisco Honey Maid crackers: 130 calories per serving, 3 g fat, 24 g carbohydrates, 2 g protein. And now, let us compare this with the low fat Nabisco Honey Maid crackers: 140 calories, 2 g fat, 28 g carbohydrates, and 2 g protein. The differences in these ratios are slight, and are not dramatic. Now (just for fun), let us look at a box of ordinary, unflavored oatmeal. I'm looking now at a box of generic oatmeal from Raley's Fine Foods. A serving has 150 calories, 2.5 g fat, 27 g carbohydrate, and 5 g protein. What does this all mean? I calculated the GRAMS PROTEIN/CALORIES for all of these products. There was little difference between the three graham cracker products, though it might be noted that the best (highest protein content per calorie) was from BACK TO NATURE. But ordinary oatmeal proved to be the best. For ordinary oatmeal, the ratio of protein/calories was twice that of the three graham cracker products. Now what can we conclude from this? If you are interested in the best nutrition, as far as oat products are concerned, then I recommend eating oatmeal right out of an oatmeal box. But in view of the fact that nobody does this sort of thing, I can recommend the BACK TO NATURE graham crackers as the next best way to satisfy your protein requirement.  The protein requirement for a young child is 24 grams of protein per day (see my book, Nutritional Biochemistry, Academic Press, 1999). In the unlikely event that you want your child to acquire all of his or her protein requirement from BACK TO NATURE graham crackers, junior would need to consume twelve (12) of these crackers per day. This is not unreasonable. While writing this review, I consumed eight (8) BACK TO NATURE crackers. Just for the record, the protein requirement for the adult baby-boomer is 2.6-times greater than that of a child (aged 4-6)."
1.0,Geomar has gone to the bottom of the hill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been buying these for several years now, I must say its like a bait and switch, the products no longer looks like the picture. I guess the conch mutated or something! I really miss the original product. I have no idea what they are packing in their cans anymore. It has been like this for the past year and half. Very disappointed!!!"
5.0,Enfamil ProSobee,This is the only soy milk product my son will drink. Why has Enfamil taken off the grocery store shelves???
5.0,Breakfast in Bed Coffee K-Cups,"This has made me into a coffee lover!  Very  mild and easy on the stomach, but with a great flavor.  Love it!"
5.0,Dark 85% Chocolate Organic: Best dark chocolate I've ever had,"I am trying to lose weight.  I ordered this chocolate on the recommendation of my son, and he was right on!  Unusually creamy for a dark chocolate, it is luxuriously satisfying for my chocolate craving.  I ordered ten bars and am limiting myself to six squares a day but when I finally run out I will buy some more!"
5.0,Deeeeeeeeelicious!,"This polenta is easy to make and has wonderful texture and flavor.  I usually add a bit more than 3 tbls of cheese, but even without cheese - this is a tasty polenta.  And the fact that is organic and cooks in a very short amount of time is just a huge bonus."
1.0,Absurd,"Or go to any grocery store, where this retails for $12 and is often on sale for $10.  This cannot possibly be for real."
1.0,TOO MANY BAGS LEAKED  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"MANY OF THESE COFFEE BAGS LEAKED SINGLE GRINDS AND COULDN'T BE USED,SO I HAD TO THROW A LOT AWAY.DESPITE THE GOOD PRICE IT WASN'T WORTH IT-TOO MUCH WAS WASTED.IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER I'D SAY THEY WERE REJECTS FOM TH FACTORY.I HAVE BEEN BUYING THES FROM THE STORE AND NEVER HAD ANYTHING SO AWFUL"
5.0,Delicious aromatic tea,"I love ginger, I make ginger tea by grating fresh frozen ginger root into a pot of tea and steeping. I bought this tea after reading some reviews and because I love ginger ...and now....I love this tea. The other reviewer is right - this tea is delicious. I'm sure the aroma of baking gingerbread and warm cinnamon help, but it doesn't need sugar and it's fantastic! I've had it both with and without milk and it's delicious either way. I highly recommend this tea - just don't buy it all! :D (and I'm not a huge herbal tea fan)"
5.0,Apricot jello used for making Apricot Zucchini Jam,I make Aricot Zucchini jam with fresh zucchini several times a year. It is very popular with the neighbors and family members. Apricot Jello is very hard to come by in the stores so I'm glad I can find it on amazon.Great product.
1.0,Terrible taste,"I purchased this product from my local health food store.  It was still well within its sell-by date.  I tasted it both plain and in a raw food recipe (with dates and nuts), and in both cases it had a terrible taste.  It was very dry and tasted overwhelmingly of soap.  I will not purchase this product again."
5.0,Lovely but NOT a Marathon bar (Marathon is the old name for Snickers - at least in England),"I am from England, missing a taste of home and ordered these for my kids to try. They are chewy caramel in a chocolate coating. Yum. I just wanted to clarify, Marathon bars are the same as Snickers - at least in England. The name changed when I was a teen I think. Curly Wurlys are completely different! They have no nuts or soft bits, just the caramel and chocolate."
1.0,bottles damaged order incomplete,I was very happy to find that this water was available for order. I ordered a dozen and ordered 3 dozen more. My first box was just delievered a half hour ago and the seals were broken on several bottles. Th order was also missing 2 bottles! I suspect warehousing was thirsty??? I even signed up for a monthly save subscriptons to have them mailed to me every month going forward. I  am so disappointed right now!! The other three dozen were shippe to me today but the rep was great in having contacted UPS to return the order to them. He candelled the subscription and told me to expect a refund 2-3 days after the orders are returned to the warehouse.
5.0,High-quality mild decaf green tea,"I like this green tea because it is:  (1) The leaves look very quality and wholesome (2) It is organically grown (3) It has a very mild pleasing flavor (4) The storage bag conveniently seals (5) For this price, the quality is unbeatable"
1.0,gatorade too expensive,"i bought this because i could not find it at local stores.  however, later noted product was much cheaper locally, so could not recommend buying this product."
5.0,Nice gift idea,This was a big hit at Christmas dinner with both kids and adults.  The set makes a nice hostess gift when visiting family or friends at the holidays and the candy was very tasty.
1.0,A very unpleasant and not at all sweet flavor for me,"It's probably just me... about six months ago, I stopped using no-calorie sweeteners at all, and I've been using mostly honey and agave syrup since then.  Maybe I'm not used to other sweeteners anymore.  My first impression of this was that it had a terrible flavor, and it wasn't very sweet at all.  I tried it first in a cup of tea--instead of my usual scant teaspoon of honey, I tried half a packet of Nectresse.  The flavor was bad enough that I dumped the tea.  I waited a day before trying it in some plain yogurt.  I added a little bit to a small amount of yogurt, and again, threw it away after the first taste.  Just to compare, I tried a little Splenda in some fresh plain yogurt, and it tasted fine, though just sweet, without the depth of flavor of honey.  Looking at other reviews, it seems as though some people love it and some find it unpleasant.  I'd suggest trying a small amount before stocking up on this sweetener."
1.0,Terrible,We ordered two jars of these cooked and peeled chestnuts.  The vacuum was opened on one bottle and we tossed it out.  The seal on the second jar was OK but the chestnuts were mealy.  We tossed it out.  I think we should get our charges refunded.
1.0,Misleading,"I was hopeful the couple of negative reviews i read were wrong. Nope. They weren't. I just received this today and the first thing I look at is the ingredients in the oil. 90% pomace rape oil, 10 % EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil. Not at all what i expected. I do understand the need for the disclaimer on this product but at the same time if i cannot rely on the information in the product description then i am just supposed to take a chance on this?? I will be contacting amazon to see what i can do about it."
5.0,Yuummy,"I bought these because I wanted something to replace my regular cinnamon sugar graham cracker snack since I could no longer have them due to gluten intolerance! I never expected them to come even close, but they are super yummy. They have the same satisfying crunch as graham crakers and tbe same yummy cinnamon sugar taste. I will definately buy again!"
1.0,Cat won't eat it,"I feel really bad writing this review since I am a big fan of the Newman's Own brand for human food. Their salad dressings are amazing. However, my cat would not eat this product. I purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats. I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it. I am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food."
1.0,9 lbs - not 10 as advertised!!!,"I usually buy 42 oz canisters in my local grocery store, it's $4.95, so I figured, 10 lbs would be OK for $18+. I was unpleasantly surprised when the arrived pack clearly stated, 2 packs of 4.5 lbs inside, total - 9 lbs, not 10 as advertised! Not buying anymore.  You gotta change your listing guys - you cannot be misleading the consumers into buying smaller pack than they think it is!!!"
5.0,Best of Starbucks' whole bean coffees,"Sumatra is a dark, fragrant coffee with hints of chocolate. It has a subtle aftertaste and is as tasty with desert as it is served black. I'm not a big fan of most Starbucks' beans, but this one breaks that trend. My wife and I find ourselves going back to this bean as our staple coffee bean of choice. If you enjoy a darker cup of coffee with some subtlety, this is a great option."
1.0,Does not taste anything like curry,I've been buying curry powder from different companies for about 20 years. This powder does not taste anything like curry powder. I even can't tell you how it tastes because it's the first time that I taste something like this. All I can tell you is that the taste is not pleasant. I think they made a mistake in mixing the ingredients. I got a refund on it.
1.0,Pertains to Subscribe and Save of this product,"If you want to order this via subscribe and save be aware that once placed, you cannot cancel, stop or return the order (you can only cancel future orders). I had a specific address to send it to and they sent it to my PO box - not very convenient - but the seller was very helpful and immediately responsive.  EDIT: The price and seller have changed -- it has gone up $8."
1.0,Mis-communications & restocking fees,"The product description used metric measurements, not mainline American inches measurements.  Thus I ended up getting the wrong size and wanting to exchange the product.  I discovered the shipping and restocking charges were more than the cost of the original order.  Not at all pleased with the transaction.  Owner did not seem to care about whether I was happy or not.  He just said he's always had a great rating and I must be the problem.  I wasn't looking to set blame on anyone, I was looking to make things right.  I threw the product away and vowed to never knowingly do business with this company again."
5.0,Best Cocoa On The Planet,"Seriously, this is THE BEST Cocoa in the world. I recently made a Fudge Ripple Cake with it, and the frosting (using the Pernigotti Cocoa) was the best I've ever made. Everyone raved about it. Now, the question is, should I share the secret to the fantastic taste of this cake and frosting with them.  Hmm..."
5.0,You know what I haven't had in a while?,"Big League Chew.  True Story: I was addicted to Big League Chew. Almost destroyed my life until I checked myself into the clinic. What a reality-check. The therapist slapped me in the face for even thinking of kicking my Big League Chew habit.  The product description reads, ""Target consumer: Boys 6-12 with an active interest in baseball"" but declines to mention the rock-star status one receives upon bringing a box of Big League chew to work. Since I brought the box to work this morning, I've since been promoted nine times, from mail-room drone to Executive Director of Awesome."
5.0,Finally a snack bar without apples,"These are a great bar for those who can't have apples.  They are about the consistency of taffy, which is great because my son thinks its candy.  Easy to transport for on-th-go snacks.  Half of a bar is enough to satisfy my son's appetite for a snack."
5.0,Coffee T Disc Carousel,The Carousel is easy to fill and easy getting the T Discs' out. Takes up very little space and the stainless steel is easy to clean and looks sleek on the counter.  It is affordable and ordering and receiving it was easy as is everything from Amazon.
1.0,"hard, stale, hurts child's mouth",I was disappointed to receive Earth's Best Organic Snakin' Fruit Rings Banana because it hurt my child when she bit into the hard and stale treat.
5.0,makes great sushi,"I have used this rice to make sushi several times, and it always works great, though I usually have to cook it longer than the instructions say. In any case, the texture is perfect and sticky, and making sushi is well worth the effort--it's a crowd pleaser, as well as a fun thing to try with friends. Don't forget the rice vinegar!"
1.0,If there were no Chickens Left,"I guess I got the title wrong. If there were no food left is what it should really say. I broke down and opened up this can to try it out and kind of wished I had waited till there was no more food left on this whole planet. When that day comes, these powdered eggs would taste pretty good. But knowing there is a grocery store a few miles from here and knowing that I could pack something much more tasty if I were to go backpacking, I would have to opt out on packing these powdered eggs. They are edible, but they are by no means a viable replacement unless you used bacon grease to cook them in or you had some ketchup to put on them. Something to add some taste to them as they are bland with a tint/hint of egg flavor. Some people were looking for what ratio of egg powder to water they should use. Well, it does not really matter so long as you actually dissolve the powder since the cooking process evaporates the water. However, I do believe that you might want to use more than an even 1:1 ratio. I think a 1:1.25 ratio would be better. Make them a little more runny so that they spread out over the pan you are cooking them in. As for the rest of my can of eggs, I suppose I am going to have to vacuum seal them and hope they last till the end of food as we know it."
1.0,Not what it said,It says a pack of 12.  I received 6 and have never heard from them again.  I contacted them and have heard nothing.
1.0,inedible,"If you have loved Potato Buds for years, stay away from the ""new & improved"" version.  Horrible, truly disgusting, and what's even worse...the company doesn't care and intends to keep turning out this tripe.  They even blame the poor reception of the ""improved"" version on the customers, saying they are just fine if prepared according to the box.  Um, no.  It tastes awful.  It's so sad, because this used to be a great product."
5.0,The feedback speaks for itself,"This is probably some of the best coffee I've had, even though it's pre-ground that doesn't seem to matter. Keep it up guys !!"
1.0,"Worst ""candy"" available today!","Sorbee brand Sugar Free Licorice Bites do just that: bite.  It is quite possibly the least flavorful candy available.  It resembles black candle wax in flavor and texture, seems stale and is thoroughly lacking in licorice flavor.  I will NEVER buy this product again, and I urge you to avoid this ""candy"" like the plague."
1.0,never purchase this again,"When I received this order, the outside of the box was wet from the leaking contents inside. The creamers were just thrown in the box and were not even in a plastic bag. It was a mess. I had to wash the few remaining creamers that were still in tact because everything was sticky and dirty.  I will not be ordering this item again."
5.0,Best tomato juice cocktail ever!,"I drank this as a kid. It was always a special treat. Living in the Southwest, it was ridiculously abundant. Nowadays it is almost impossible to find in AZ, for some very odd reason I have yet to discover. If you like Green Chiles, and like tomato juice, you will love Snap-E-Tom!  By the way, it also happens to make an excellent Bloody Mary."
5.0,"Albacore tuna, just a better taste than your normal tuna",Tuna is really all the same unless you can find a good albacore or yellowfin tuna.  This Albacore tuna is a good tuna with no oil providing exactly what you need for salads and sandwiches.  Very consistent taste and quality in the six cans we received.  I can never find Chicken of the Seas premium tuna so Amazon.com becomes the right home for us on price and service.
5.0,Good stuff,"Best bang for the buck in canned herring. Great taste. Add it to any veggie, and you have yourself a easy meal. Can't beat the Amazon price."
5.0,Better than the peanuts version!,I grew up eating Snickers candy bars. Love them. But do you know what I love even more? Snickers Almond Bar! I have no idea why but they taste better than the original. Maybe it's the almonds or maybe it's something else but the Snickers almond bar taste great! Try one!
1.0,Disgustingly illegal item.,"Nothing disposable is allowed when it comes to the AMERICAN FLAG.  Having a disposable wrapper ""trashes"" my beloved nation's flag.  This most certainly can't be an American owned business.  I'm surprised Amazon allowed it."
1.0,Buyer Beware but not wary enough,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON Artic Zero -- Deeply disappointed -- this product is similar to ""ice milk"" with an odd consistency and a bad aftertaste -- my husband says ""it tastes like cardboard"" -- Artic Zero rates a ""0"" -- I would give it less than 1-star if I could. AND IT IS NON-RETURNABLE/NON-REFUNDABLE"
5.0,Nothing compares to Planter's Spanish Peanuts!,"While I always liked peanuts, it wasn't until I chose them as a low carb, low sugar snack that I discovered that no other brand compared to the taste of Planter's.  Then they started to get scarce - everyone was discontinuing them, or charging exorbitant prices.  I bought them at WalMart until they discontinued them, and then special ordered from my local market until they couldn't get them for me.  Then I discovered them at Amazon -- and at a good price, delivered.  I am a happy customer!!"
1.0,Pods explode making a huge mess!,"Many of these exploded making a huge mess with grounds spewing in and out of the cup and onto the counter. After the first one I thought maybe there was one bad one.  I have seen it before with Green Mountain brand but rarely,  Maybe one out of 10 boxes. After the third one exploded I tossed the remainder in the trash."
5.0,Best oatmeal!,"I feel ridiculous getting so excited about oatmeal, but I really love Flahavans.  A friend's Irish nanny introduced it to me about 14 years ago and I've been buying it since (whenever I could find it)."
1.0,Out of Date by 6 months!!,"Shipment of pods came with a best-before date that was a full 6 months before delivery. Be aware that Amazon lists all ""grocery"" items as non-returnable."
5.0,Shultz Plant Food A Great Product,I have used this product for many years for all of my house plants. I had look everywhere is the city that I live in for Schultz Plant Food and could not find it and imagine that I found it on Amazon. I was delighted. It is a geat product.
1.0,Disappointed second-time buyer,"This is the second time I bought these beef tendons. The first time they were fine - the shape was long, the way they are supposed to be, and they were easy for my dog to chew.  But this last time, the shapes were bulky and awkward and resulted in my dog's choking on one of these irregular and strange-shaped pieces that she tried to swallow and that got stuck in her throat. The choking episode went on for 15 minutes and ended only when she vomited her entire stomach contents. it was very frightening."
5.0,Amazing!,"I bought this cornbread for the first time and made it last night. It was incredible! Just the right amount of honey and the texture was also very nice. I used applesauce instead of oil (to cut back on fat and calories) and you couldn't tell the difference. I also added cheddar cheese, canned corn, and green onions and they were delicious. I definitely recommend this product!"
5.0,MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD PAST,"As a kid in the 40's and 50's it was such a wonderful treat to go to a neighborhood drugstore soda fountain with my mother and sister and order a chocolate malted milk served with two Salerno cookies wraped in celophane. The malted milk was mixed in a metal container that held probably 12 or more ounces milk, a scoop or two of icecream, chocolaet syrup and malt powder and could refill my glass after finishing the first. I found it in Amazon's grocery and gourmet food selections and have signed up for subscribe and save to make sure I always have it on hand. Now I heat soy milk and pour it into a cup with the malt powder and have a delicious, sentimental, warm, cozy and comforting bedtime treat.I'd better stop before I start to weep."
5.0,Best Cherry Chocolate that I have come across.,I was looking for something to replenish one of my favorite Black Forest(Cherry Chocolate)Hot Cocao mixes and this one works quite well and tastes even better. Keep up the good work.
5.0,HawaiianRyan,"Wow,  The real Hawaiian May's Teri Chicken! Awsome taste, stays juice after grilling.Its an Original Hawaiian Product found in all teh Hawaiian islands. Mahalo"
1.0,Expiered. Do not buy!,When I got them at first I was only a bit disappointed because they were a bit smashed. Then I ate one and realized they were stale and checked the experation  date. Turns out that they were 11 months old. Do. Not. Buy.
1.0,Try them first,"Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first.  I tried Nescafe cappuccino pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods.  Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL.  Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine.  The cappuccino maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return.  I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first!"
5.0,Amazon find,Love the taste of this tea. Had some at a resturant in Vegas and kept the bag to try and search it out. Was not dissappointed.
5.0,Great Almonds,"I ordered these in the beginning of August on a really hot day and they came intact so I don't know what happened to the people who complained about melting. The almonds were wrapped in some sort of tin foil cold pack that was already expired by the time we got them but the product was intact. Kind of room temperature. The almonds were spectacular, by the way. So if you like dark chocolate and almonds, this is for you! Way cheaper than at the fancy stores. If you're looking for fancy packaging, you're out of luck. They come in baggies. Since I don't care for fancy packaging it was fine with me. If you want to impress someone with packaging you will have to provide your own. Strongly recommend these treats. Word of warning: they are highly addictive!!!!"
5.0,Only flavored coffee my husband likes!,"This coffee has a very strong cherry flavor.  It's the only flavored coffee my husband likes, though he prefers I cut with with 50% regular coffee to tone down the flavoring a bit.  While some people may view this as a negative, it is so refreshing to actually be able to taste the flavor in a flavored coffee.  Too many times I've bought flavored coffee and not been able to taste the flavoring at all!  Other members of my family like it full strength. I am very pleased with it and have purchased my second 3-pack."
5.0,you can't give a bad review to Ortiz tuna!,All of the Ortiz tuna I've tried has been wonderful and it's become the only canned tuna I'll use.  Worth every cent and only fresh seems better.
5.0,Great fruit snack!,"These are absolutely wonderful.  Well- my son likes them, anyhow... I don't really. But, they are so much healthier than the awful fruit snack you can buy in the grocery store.  There is nothing in these besides fruit.  I am not a 'health nut'- but I do try to avoid high fructose corn syrup, and unnecessary sugar.  Which makes getting things for my son's lunch very difficult.  Anyhow, my son has one of these in his lunch almost every day.  His teacher noticed that his fruit snack was actually made of fruit- and so has been recommending them to parents- (his school has a 'no candy' lunch policy, and the fruit snacks that you can buy in the grocery store fall into the candy group).  They are expensive.  I don't particulary like them myself (I've never liked fruit snacks of any sort though, so that isn't indicitive of the product's worth at all!).  I find that they leave my son with sticky hands.  Even with those negative points- they are still a 5 star snack.  They are healthy, and my son loves them- what more I can ask?"
5.0,Soft & Perfectly Sweet,"The texture of Strawberry Smoothie Chewing Gum is perfectly soft and not ""rubbery"" like so many sugarless chewing gums. The flavor is sweet and mildly fruity and doesn't have a strong artificial strawberry flavor. Many of the sugarless gums seem to contain too much xylitol and it burns my mouth, this one doesn't."
1.0,UGH!,"I had read about this product in several magazines and was anxious to try it - but after the smell and the first bite, I had to toss it.  The smell when you first open the package is nasty but goes away after much rinsing and parboiling.  The ultimate gross out though was the texture - just not what I am expecting from a pasta."
1.0,Don't waist your time or money,"The bag should have been labeled ""Mice Ears"".  There wasn't a decent sized ear in the bag.  I will buy from the local pet store from now on.  The price ended up being the same and the quality is better."
5.0,Great product! ...but pricy.,"Brain Toniq is an interesting product. I love the fact that it is an energy drink and focus enhancer without all of the additives and caffeine. However, I'm still not exactly sure what gives this product its effectiveness. There's no major amounts of vitamin B or no ingredients like taurine or guarana, so what is it? I don't know, but I do know the ingredients are good and that it works. That's good enough for me.  The down side to this product is its very pricy, especially considering the drinks only have one major ingredient, agave nectar. So why charge $2 a can for it? I guess they just can. If they can continue to succeed with this product at that price then I commend them for their marketing abilities.  Overall this is a 5 star product with 3 stars for price."
1.0,no good,"Unfortunately this particular box of gums contained staled and hard pieces. Don't know why, since the fruity flavour Orbit gums were great . . . ."
5.0,Instant Ganoderma Coffee,"I like this product and the price was affordable.  It has a good taste and I use it in my morning smoothie.  Not a big coffee drinker, but I like the healing qualities that the coffee claims. Enjoying this product very much."
1.0,"THIS WAS GREAT, BUT NOW IS NOT","I've had an Amazon subscription on this cereal for the past year and in this last shipment, Kashi has changed their recipe.  The cereal is no longer what it used to be.  The flavor is like eating cardboard now... what a pity.  Fairly warned be thee, says I, matey."
5.0,True Southern Taste,"I grew up in the south, and I've been looking for a convenient and authentic tasting sweet tea for some time.  I found it here.  The cane sugar adds the perfect sweetness and makes a delightful, refreshing summer drink."
1.0,HORRIBLE TASTE,I have to agree with the other reviewer. This is truly the WORST tasting beverage I have ever tried. I could not even finish one can. I threw it away. Complete waste of money.
5.0,Excellent,"This is some of the best balsamic vinegar I have had the pleasure of using. My wife and I both were very pleased, and will be buying again."
1.0,not very good at all,I was very disappointed with this dairy free mac and cheese -- I did it like I would make other mac and cheese  -- I always melt the butter and add the mix - then the milk  --  ( I tried both soy and regular-- )  mix them in sauce pan  -- I was upset because first of price and then it tasted terrible --  I have done other mac and cheese mixes and there is something wrong with calling them mac and cheese --  They are elbows and whatever the sauce is -- It tastes like card board-- I have used lots of different soy cheeses - and other non dairy mixes -- this is awful  --  I wouldn't waste your money on it  --
1.0,NOT GLUTEN FREE,"These soups are listed in the gluten free foods. Please read ingredients. This is an example of incorrect listings. If you have celiac disease, as I do, do not assume foods that are listed in this category are truly gluten free. And, Amazon, please find a way to better regulate this. By the way, the one star rating has nothing to do with the soup, I cannot eat this, the rating is for the listing."
1.0,can't rate it lower than one star,"Both of my cats developed bladder problems on this food where previously they had none before. Then changed to the chicken natural balance with the same issues again. Will never use this brand again, probably should be recalled"
1.0,The Absolute Worst,This is going straight into the trash. I wish I would have read these reviews before buying. How can such an established brand produce something so awful?
5.0,MMMM MMMM MMMM GOOD!,"Ritz has nothing over these delicious crackers.  My favorite snack is these 'snackers' lightly smeared with natural butter (I know, I know)  Sometimes I have them plain, sometimes with peanut butter.  Great for appetizers (try a thin slice of cucumber, sprinkled with coarse ground black pepper corns).  Kids love them with lemon curd or fruit preserves.  Try them, they really are delicious!"
1.0,So Disappointed,"I was afraid that exactly what happend, would, and it did! I am a huge fan of the ""Organic"" Fair Trade from Coffee People, but of course saw that it was out of stock, which led to my order of the Tree Hugger blend with some hesitation. I was right!!! It tastes like, perhaps, one would expect Tree bark would taste. It is no ""fair trade"" at all for the Organic. Will never order again, nor do I have the heart to even give it away. It's going back to the earth in which it came, via: Garbage pick-up."
1.0,A truly gross coffee candy.  Worst one ever.,"I've tried numerous coffee candies and this is by far the worst I've ever had. I should have known, seeing the main ingredient as Glucose syrup. Not only does it break up in your mouth, but the texture of the center goop is nauseating like a blob of snot. It breaks into sharp shards first, then you get the gross inner surprise...bleh!!! If you like high fructose type syrup, then this crap is for you."
5.0,Delicious!,I never write reviews but this product deserves it.  This has to be the tastiest protein drink in the world. I LOVE how it's organic and has vitamins and minerals packed into this little box of deliciousness! If I'm on the run I love that I can grab this and just chug it. The best part is that even when it's warm it's pretty delicious. I prefer it cold but it isn't bad either way. It is seriously the best grab and go drink on the market!
1.0,Incompatible with Nesspresso machines.,"Amazon website automatically suggest these pods with Nesspresso machines.  These pods are huge and INCOMPATIBLE with Nesspresso machines.  Please beware of that.  The coffee maybe good, but it's advertized with the wrong products.  As far as I can see Amazon is not selling Nesspresso pods at all."
5.0,Great product,"This seasoning tastes delicious on every kind of meat. We've used it on red meat, chicken, and even salmon. Getting the 24oz can is definitely worth it because this seasoning should be used liberally. I have no negative comments about this product. Give it a try!"
1.0,"why, I ask?",Why would anyone pay 11.80 for one of these when it's a couple of bucks in the local supermarket?  Who are they kidding?
5.0,LOVE this tea!!!,"This tea is great. I always use one black and one Nutcracker for some super ""energizing"" wake-up Tea. Good stuff, but I've seen it cheaper."
1.0,I'm a Crystal Light lover and I won't be buying this flavor... ever,"I'm a huge fan of Crystal Light.  I always have a pitcher full in the fridge and a packet in my purse for my water bottle.  I was so excited to try this new flavor but unfortunately for me... this one is a fail.  The flavor smells alright but the flavor tastes fake, for lack of a better work.  Initally, when you take the first drink it reminds me of a jolly rancher.  The flavor is very strong.  Before I even swallowed the first sip I was overwhelmed with the thoughts of a fake almost plastic taste.  The aftertaste is just awful.  I unfortunately don't have anything positive to say about this flavor and am absolutely sure that I won't be purchasing this flavor.... ever."
1.0,UGG,"I really hated this sauce, it was all think and gumny, not like the stuff you get at the resturants. No real taste either"
1.0,Just not real espresso,"I was hopeful, but left unsatisfied.  The color of the bean grounds says it all; a light brown not the typical dark brown to black of real espresso.  Taste is weak and odd, not rich and solid.  Certainly not worth the extra $$.  Recommend Cafe Bustelo instead."
1.0,Made In China,"The Mrs. Mays ""Deal of the Day"" bars are made in China.. look for  disclosure regarding this very important detail. this is the very reason I will not purchase them and am confident there are many who feel as I.  And as well, the nutritional content is not available on many of the offered variations. Not what I have come to expect  from my allthetime online shopping source Amazon, beloved quite equally to  Google."
1.0,not organic,"ordered a case of this, it said it was organic lemon lime soda and a picture of organic is there to. but i got natural lemon lime soda"
5.0,"The ""green pearl"" of tea.","Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the ""green pearl"" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself ""home of silk and tea"" for its two primary natural products.  The name ""gunpowder"" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.  Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream."
1.0,Ate the entire can just to write this review...,"This item tasted like what I expect a carp would taste.  Typically purchase King Oscar products, but wife believes in garage sale items infested with bed bugs and thinks the overflowing sale bins are great deal items - not items that don't sell for a reason.  The ""hot sauce"" is nothing but hot and I've had fewer bones in Shad.  There were a total of 3 ""sardines"", or whatever these were, in the can.  I kept an unopened bottle of Devil's Springs Vodka on hand for years for extreme remedy purposes and used it to get rid of the bio-solid waste taste this product left behind.  Funny - country of origin in USA, but is product of Thailand...  must be snakehead..?? Truly believe this is not Bluefin tuna so it's at least not contaminated with radiation from Japan.  NOT WORTH A BUCK A CAN!!!!!!  NOTE: **** had to rate this 1 Star after shooting for ZERO stars got the message ""Please rate this item.""  I honestly believe Jessica Simpson had something when she said she thought Chicken of the Sea was Chicken...  This one's not really fish!!"
1.0,"Yes, great ingredients. But Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED","This is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now. To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too. But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.I too love Grain Free dog food and love that the first ingredient is actually the real meat. My baby girl loves ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison mainly. I searched relentlessly for a reasonable priced food that has no by-products, dyes and are grain free. Which my lil' white Maltese needed for her allergies and tear stains. But, now Diamond Dog Food has been RECALLED for ""Salmonella"" This company makes various products that have been recalled too. Such as: Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.  I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled! So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients. I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week. My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now. I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier! I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying."
5.0,a standout product,"I'm a male, which means I usually just grab the cheapest conditioner on the shelf (Garnier Fructus, Pert, or some other green bottled generic equivalent).  However, after trying this product I'm going to have to rethink my time honored strategy. For a few simple reasons:  -very gentle scent...doesn't leave you smelling like you just had a shower -a little palm of product will go a long way -leaves hair feeling great and not 'coated' with product after you rinse it out -sleek, cool looking bottle (hey!  I'm a marketing guy...I'm seduced by such things)  Give it a try."
1.0,**Agree that the tea has changed--4th purchase**,"I have deleted my previous glowing review of this product and cancelled our subscribe and save for this item.  Our most recent purchase has left me highly disappointed.  The only way I can describe the flavor of the tea that is now being brewed is ""cardboard-ish"".  No flavor at all...  Just brown and disgusting.  Very unhappy.  They also changed the packaging to a very wide mouthed bag and when I poured it into the air-tight container we use it went everywhere--not practical at all.  I will not buy this again.  While I appreciate a savings, I do enjoy my morning cuppa quite a bit more and this has left me looking for another brand."
5.0,Great Dog Food,I love this dog food. I was looking for something that was higher is protein to help my dogs fur and one that had higher quality ingredients with no by products. This works well for my dogs ( Maltese/ Yorkie mis and a Maltese/poodle mix). I had read reviews that higher protein was not good for smaller dogs so I called my vet and was assured that it would be good for them. My Morkie has always had stinky breath but I have noticed a slight increase in it but that is taken care of mostly with teeth brushing and puppy breath strips. My Maltipoo's breath is unaffected and fine. The only downside to the food is the cost and being able to find it. We currently order it online but are trying to get a local private pet store to carry it.
5.0,roland sesame seeds wasabi flavor,"These are fabulous.  A must have for the wasabi freak.  These are great and you will love them, i have turned many people on to these one of which was a sushi chef who now uses them in his rolls.  Thanks.  Wasabi Girl"
1.0,May add trips to the bathroom,"I had been drinking Knudson's Just Black Jerry juice for several years to prevent gout, and it worked.  But when the stores in my area were no longer stocking it, I had to find an alternative. This was the 2nd different one which I tried. While it appears all the ones I tried still help me stay away from gout pain, this one had an added affect. Yes, diarrhea. It took me a few days to figure it out. I had been drinking it for about a week and was feeling well other then the extra trips to the bathroom. Figured it had to be something I was eating or drinking. This was the only ""new"" thing I had introduced. So I stopped drinking it and within 24 hours my bowels were back to normal and have stayed back to normal.  Also fortunately the Knudson Just Black Cheery juice was back in stock at my store, so I am back on it and have no unwanted side affects. The store manager told me it was a back order issue with Knutson.  So all is well today.  And I have always had a pretty strong stomach. I pity those who do not."
5.0,"Gold Standard of Irish Tea, a SUPER Brew.","My wife brought home a box of Barry's Gold Blend Tea from a Celtic specialty shop here in Anchorage, Alaska.  I drink about 3 to 5 cups of tea each day and was used to domestic, ""super market"" brands of tea.  I was impressed with Barry's deep rich, almost sweet, flavor and quickly used up the box she bought. The local price here made me shy away from buying Barry's very often but found more reasonable sellers  via the internet. I was pleased to find Amazon as a source with free shipping it makes my Barry's tea habit less of a guilty pleasure.  Try a cuppa, I think you will find it a bonny brew"
1.0,this noodle sucks,"I just burned my finger while i was trying to hold this failed cup noodle. There was a hole on the side, so the hot water leak out and burn my finger. i would never buy or eat any nissin cup noodle. i mean how fail can the company be in order to make a cup noodle with tiny hole on the side, so your customer can burn their hand. FAILED"
1.0,These have a horrible taste,I received these sprinkles as a gift to use to decorate cupcakes for my son's birthday party.  Before putting them on I ate a few and am so glad I did.  These taste awful!  There is no way I could serve these to guests.  It is a really cute idea and would have been perfect for the dinosaur themed party but the taste has to be addressed.
5.0,Just a great product,"I'm diabetic and have tried many sugar substitutes and I like stevia the best, plus it puts some fiber in your diet.  Before trying Stevia I had mostly used sucralose (Splenda) and drinks and foods sweetened with sucralose but found them to be overly sweet for my taste.  I like the level of sweetness in drinks sweetened with Stevia much better (mainly Celestial Seasonings products)and in tea or coffee I sweeten myself with the concentrate.  Highly recommend this."
5.0,Wake Up Call,My wife and I enjoy a pot of Green Chai Tea each morning.  It has a great flavor.  It is a little hard to find in grocery stores at the quantity that we like.  Hint... set it up as a subscription and you will pay less than most grocery stores and you will have it delivered to your door.
5.0,Great cracker,"One of the best crackers for crackers with cheese or just for munching,  Not salty, like a lot of crackers.  Enough flavor to enhance the cheese but not so much that it overwhelms.  Sounds like a cliche, but it really is a healthy cracker that tastes good."
5.0,"Great price, super sweet goodness","I love NOW's stevia extract, I put it in everything - tea, cereal, curries, stir fries, baking.  There are no sugar carbs at all and it is 200 time sweeter than sugar so 1 lb goes a long way.  The savings with a pound it amazing (compared to $10 for a very small container) and it seems to stay good for a long time, it takes me sometimes a year to finish it.  Some people find that stevia leaves an aftertaste that do not care for so you may want to try a smaller bottle first if you have never tried it.  Every brand supposedly is a little different so if you don't have good luck with one try another."
5.0,My favorite blend..,"I adore my Tassimo machine,and this is my favorite blend. The machine adds a wonderful whip to the top of the coffee, but it's not dairy--it's the coffee itself. It has a wonderful, full bodied flavor and is a joy to drink the morning."
1.0,There is NO actual truffle used in the making of this product,"This is an extremely deceptive practice. They do everything they can on the label to make you think that there is truffle used to make this product. There isn't. The ""truffle essence"" in the product is a chemical compound made in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles. Hello, Food and Drug Administration--I thought one of your jobs was to make sure that labels are very clear and understandable for consumers!!!!! Is allowing companies to write ""essence"" when that means that it is a synthetically created chemical in keeping with your department's policies. Shame on La Tourangelle and shame on the FDA."
1.0,YUK 2.0,"I hate the NEW and IMPROVED Stride 2.0, which I purchased for years. I Do Not like the foil wrapper, or the taste of the gum. (Flavor DOES NOT LAST.) I have switched to Orbit White bubblemint. YUM!"
1.0,Blech!,"None of the five folks in my household would eat this.  It tastes very raw grainy.  We're a granola type household that likes healthy organic foods, but this definitely didn't meet our standards for taste."
1.0,Don't waste your time,"Nearly tasteless... there is a faint bit of musky saltiness, but no real flavor. The same amount of money will buy enough truffle oil to flavor a dozen dishes.  At least the jar is cute!"
5.0,"Hot, Strong & Keeps My Interest...",...just like my man! Try this coffee and you'll never drink Stabucks again!
1.0,Misrepesented product description,"This is advertised as an Extra Virgin Olive Oil Super Premium. Not so. Upon receipt the label says olive oil and grapeseed oil. Cloying and dominate grapeseel oil flavor. Neither the Red Chli, the Meyer Lemon, nor the Blood Orange Infused rises to the flavor profile expectation. Plus that grapeseed oil dominance is nastique. I ended up throwing all three bottles in the trash. I would never buy any of this product line ever again. Very disappointed. After many years of purchasing from Amazon, this is my first disappointment."
5.0,Great Meal in a Cup,I think the Curry is one of the best flavors...very thick and hearty and makes a good meal.  I've tried several of the Dr. McDougall flavors and Curry is probably my favorite..
5.0,Love this product,This is an awesome and easy beverage option.  Not full of excessive preservatives and garbage.  Easy to port along and turn into a beverage for my children.  Natural and flavorful.  A+ and a worthwhile buy over any powdered beverage drinks!!!!
1.0,NOT RAW ALMONDS!  See below,"The FDA made it illegal to sell RAW Almonds in the Fall of 2007.  There are people who believe that the cure for cancer lies in the raw almond, and when the FDA got wind of it, they took them off of the market for 2 cases of food poisoning.  I don't see cantaloupe being outlawed and we had how many deaths recently from food poisoning?) You can google the ruling and the outcome(s). [...]  The fact that this company advertises these as ""RAW"" almonds makes me angry.  This is false advertising.  They are steam pasteurized.  See the email below from the company to me, after I emailed them asking if these were truly ""raw"" almonds:  ------------------------------------------------------  customerservice@berginfruitandnut.com Customer Service to me show details 10/20/2011 12:09 PM Kristin,  All our raw almonds are steam pasteurized.  ------------------------------------------------------  So, if you're looking for truly ""raw"" almonds, you must look at your local Farmers' Markets, or grow your own."
5.0,yummy!,"THIS IS THE BEST BREAD WE HAVE TRIED FOR OUR 11 YEAR OLD WITH CELIAC DISEASE.  THE TEXTURE IS AS GOOD AS WHITE BREAD AND THE FLAVOR IS DELICIOUS. WE HAVE ADDED HERBS, CINNAMON, AND OTHER SPICES TO CHANGE IT UP. THE DOUGH CAN BE STICKY, SO WE MOISTEN OUR HANDS WITH WATER WHEN PATTING THE TOP TO LEVEL THE DOUGH.  THIS HELPS THE BREAD TO BE SMOOTHER ON TOP.  THIS BREAD IS BEST BAKED IN LOAF PANS IN THE OVEN RATHER THAN A BREAD MACHINE.  THE AROMA IS DELICIOUS WHEN BAKING.  WE ALSO USE CANOLA OIL INSTEAD OF BUTTER IN THE MIX.  YOU WILL NEED TO KEEP IT WRAPPED AND IN THE FRIDGE UNLESS YOU ARE A FAST BREAD EATER.  YOU CAN ALSO SLICE THE LOAF, THEN WRAP IT AND FREEZE IT AFTER IT HAS COOLED.  I ALSO ENJOY MY DAUGHTERS BREAD.  The Gluten-Free Pantry Favorite Sandwich Bread Mix, 22-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) "
5.0,LOVED it,"This is my all time favorite k cup, so far ;) we are about 2 weeks into our first keurig and have been trying all sorts of flavors.  this one is, by far, THE BEST!  used a french/vanilla creamer with it also, made it even better."
5.0,Best jelly beans out there,"These are some of the best jelly beans out there. That being said, I can't stand a couple of the flavors. I guess that shows just how good the other ones are to me!  I bought these for my husband so he could have a stash of candy for those late nights at his computer desk. I'm not really a candy person. I usually try one or two and then I'm done. These, though, I tend to sneak a palm-full of every once in a while. They are addicting! Very bold flavors and they've never been stale or too hard. Perfect for Easter as well."
1.0,Not good,"I purchased these kcups to use with my Cuisinart Keurig maker.  While the product tastes good, it repeatedly causes brewing problems with the cuisinart, either stopping its function completely or causing it to overflow.  Would not recommend for use with Cuisinart makers."
5.0,Its a sack,"Dont know what to say about these, Its a paper bag, Nothing more, Nothing less. What else could i tell you ?"
5.0,Lotte Koala's March Strawberry Cookies,These are absolutely delicious.  I love love love to eat them and am going to order more soon!  These taste just like Koala Yummies from back in the day!
1.0,Good Bean 4 Flavor Variety Pack,YUCK!!  YUCK!!! YUCK!!!  Who would think that anything cinnamon could be so unappealing and downright gross tasting?  The Smoky Chili & Lime is no better.  Huge waste of money and I will definitely not order again!
5.0,the best,This is without doubt the best rum in the world.  Every time I go to Guyana I bring a bottle home.
5.0,"Great, too bad Amazon isn't selling it currently","I was not sure about the cherries, but this turns out to be my favorite flavor now. Now that Amazon doesn't sell it anymore, it isn't reasonably priced IMO, especially with shipping."
5.0,Best Chili ever!,"I used to live in Cincy, now in California.  Thank goodness Cincinnati Chili comes in a package!  I bought 12 so I won't run out for awhile.  This is the best spiced chili ever and so easy to make. Thanks!"
5.0,Excellent,"Well I just finished my first can and ordered more.  The nonfat stuff you buy in a cardboard box at the supermarket is just plain disgusting tasting-even mixed into sauces or with chocolate sauce added. So I thought maybe this whole milk powder might taste better. Night and day! This stuff is delicious-even just drinking as milk. I don't even use this as a ""survival"" food. I keep a can in the fridge (I don't know if that's required, but I feel if you can, it probably stays fresh longer) and I use it for all my milk needs, rather than buying a jug of milk and then throwing 1/3 away when it goes bad. I use this for sauces, in cereal, soups-in fact anywhere I want to use milk. And it is, as another reviewer put it: ""yummy"" stuff."
5.0,"Kitties love ""junk food""","My two kitties enjoy a diet of all natural top of the line cat food, but they are not above enjoying a little ""junk food"" now and then. I ran out of their natural brand between shipments and went to the supermarket where I grabbed a few cans of Fancy Feast, not even looking at what flavor it was. The kits were pawing at the can as soon as I popped the top and started gobbling the food before it even hit the dish! I was shocked! None the less, I can't help calling Fancy Feast Roasted Chicken ""junk food"", since chicken,( which is ""supposed"" to be in the can---and, by the way, ROASTED !!!! if we are to believe the label), is listed in a distant fifth place, after fish broth, meat by products, salmon, and wheat gluten. I care about what goes into the pets' food as much as I do my own and I have seen the benefits of a good healthy diet on their general health, appearance and well being... however, that being said, I can't see the harm in indulging in some tasty little food by products now and again...we all need a junk food fix now and again, and since the kitties love it so much, it makes me happy to give it to them as  a treat."
1.0,extreme mediocritiy,"The Matcha came promptly.  There is plenty of it.  Those are the positives. The color of the Matcha looks nothing like the photo.  It is a deeper,  darker more muted green.  It tastes similar to what it looks-muddy,  sort of like dirty,  grassy, water. I have purchased much higher quality Matcha at very reasonable prices ($18.00 for 8oz.) in Japanese markets in NYC and L.A.  I purchased this to drink every morning and to use in cooking and frappuccinos.  So far,  it is best for frappuccinos where the flavor is enhanced with plenty of sugar and Mimic Cream (almond, cashew cream substitute). I would not recommend this product.  Either spend more or keep looking.  Good luck!"
1.0,Sickly Sweet Cereal w/ Consistency of a a Cheeto,"I'm a big fan of Captain Crunch, Cocoa Krispies, Cocoa Puffs, Golden Grahams, and so on and when I read the reviews that this was 'the best cereal ever' I had to try it. Luckily my local Wal-Mart had this cereal on the shelves for $2 a box (I bought 3 boxes based on the reviews.)  Well all I can say is this cereal is terrible. Its super super sweet and the main grain puff (its a square light brown puff) that has the consistency of a hard Cheeto (the cheese snack).  The little chocolate marshmallows are good but the main component of the cereal, those grain puffs, are not to my taste. I can honestly say this is one of the worst cereals I've ever tasted."
5.0,Count chocula...the official monster cerial!!!,"Count chocula has been a favorite cereal of mine since I was a small child.  Due to difficulties finding the product in stores I ordered it online.  It's an excellent choice of chocolate cereal, with chocolate marshmallows :)  It's fantastic!!!"
5.0,Makes Playful Memories,"My dachshund, Luna, loves this treat. She is not normally one for playing with objects, but with this treat she acts like a goofy puppy. I would recommend this treat for anyone with a small dog."
5.0,Wonderful,"If you spend the money on the Scotch, why not spend a little extra on a glass? It is actually just like a good Scotch, I wouldn't really break it out at a party but after a long day at work or a nice quiet evening it is perfect."
1.0,Hate Women? Buy Proflowers,Proflowers supports the Women-hating diatribes that spew from Rush Limbaugh's mouth. their flowers are covered in the stench of toxic misogyny
1.0,Do you like Bitter?  Do you like Scummy?,"Unfortunately, I remembered the name but couldnot figure out what was wrong, so I ordered the minimum, two expensive large bottles.  I tried the sodium deficient, bitter soy product at every meal with various dishes and on solo vegetables.  Today, I trashed one expensive open bottle because scummy is the after taste.  Don't buy this product.  I normally love Commercial Soy Sauce."
5.0,Just plain good,"Try it first just black..no need for sugar or cream...unless you really, really have to...it is good...."
5.0,We both like it!,"My sister-in-law introduced me to the Wellness products in Palm Beach FL.  After reading the ingredients I had to buy a bag and try it for my 6lb Yorkipoo.  She loves it!  She used to be a finicky eater with a sensitive stomach.  On Wellness - no problems, and she's very healthy.  Only down side is I couldn't find it anywhere around where I live.  Thank goodness it's easy to order on-line!"
1.0,Dog didn't like this food.,"I bought this food thinking my dog, Jake, would like it.  It has wonderful ingredients and is very healthy.  He just wouldn't eat it!  Nothing against the dog food.  Just personal taste, I guess."
5.0,BEST TEA FOR IBS,"After having 2 doctors confirm I have IBS, I started looking for natural products that could help the symptoms.  Something I didn't have to take everyday, but wouldn't hurt me if I did.  This product is WONDERFUL!  I drink a glass of tea as soon as my stomach starts getting painful and within 10 minutes of completing the cup of tea I feel better!  I have tried instore brands, but they are weaker and don't work.  It may be a little more expenive, but it's well worth the money!!!"
5.0,Dogs love love them,"For some reason, my three dogs love these treats as do all the other dogs in the park.   I break them into smaller pieces...a bag goes a long way.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Wish it is available in USA,"Milo is very popular, delicious malt chocolate drink, in a lot of countries. It can be drink hot or cold and it can be made with water or milk, or a mixture of both. It is semi sweet, so people that like the sweetness of hot chocolate can just add a teaspoon or two sugar to it. It tastes something similar to hot chocolate when hot, and milkshake when cold. Not only does it taste really good, it is nutritious as well! It is high in iron, calcium and vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12. It is just a shame that we have to import it... (We are still searching for Milo Cereal. It is like Coco Pops, only better!)"
5.0,great tasting coffee,The Italian blend is very smooth with an outstanding flavor. Unlike some dark or bold roast coffees this one has no bitter taste. Timothy's Italian blend is is one of our favorite coffees.
1.0,"Nice Aroma, Bitter Taste","The hazelnut aroma from this cup of coffee was really nice, but all I could taste was bitterness.  If you don't like bitter coffee this selection is probably not for you."
1.0,Great Product! But not from Amazon!,"I make a great syrup for our children during the winter months with these berries. I won't be buying this brand again however, I found another website for 1 lb, which will be cheaper on the long run."
1.0,enough salt to gag you.,"The positive review on this product is either a paid reviewer, or incompetent to share an opinion with living humans. The sodium content per serving of this product is 1000 mg. PURE POISON."
1.0,Wrong Cheese,"I ordered this combo package specifically because it included Emmentaler.  But, when it arrived, there was 4 cheeses, but only 2 were as specified on the webpage and no Emmentaler. Bummer."
5.0,Helped with my baby's food allergies,"I love this oatmeal. My baby had dairy allergies so that I had to eliminate all milk products from my diet while I was nursing him. He would have really bad diarheaa whenever I had anything that had even a small amount of milk in it. Shortly after I started feeding this cereal to him, he stopped having that adverse reaction to milk. He has also been very healthy. He's almost 1.5 now and has only been sick once.  Now if only it would do something for his teething.. lol."
1.0,somewhat misleading...,"I saw this product recommended in a cookbook, and couldn't wait to try it.  I am a vegan, so I went to the product website to check the ingredients. Surprisingly, the website did not have a list of ingredients, but it did specify that the product is ""a zero calorie, zero fat, vegetarian and kosher seasoning that makes everything taste like bacon.""  I ordered the BaconSalt, but was very disappointed when it arrived.  The ingredients are extremely unhealthy...I would never put this on my food.  Among other things that I can't pronounce, this product contains corn syrup, monosodium glutamate, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, hydrolyzed corn and soy proteins, artifical flavor, yellow 6 and red 40.  So YES, it is vegetarian (not vegan...it contains lactic acid, and the red food coloring is derived from insects), but NO, it is NOT a healthy product.  So unless you're one of those vegans who lives on french fries and diet soda, this is NOT a product you want in your spice cabinet.  I wish there had been a product review on BaconSalt when I researched it on Amazon.  I definitely would not have bought it if I had known how unhealthy this seasoning is.  You'd be better off eating bacon!"
1.0,Unrecognizable!,When I received this I thought it was spotted rocks. They were hard with white spots all over them. Not edible at all.
1.0,3rd beware - bad reactions to this cereal,"Twice after giving my baby this cereal he vomited profusely to the point of becoming pale, clammy and limp. He stayed listless for a while the first time, very scary. He's not allergic to any of the ingredients but I won't be giving him this boxed cereal again. Not sure what the problem is but I saw another review with the same issues so be aware."
5.0,Amazingly REAL!,My nephew turned us on to this seasoning when we visited him in Michigan.  We are from Calif and love our Mexican Food.  This seasoning was the REAL thing and now we're keeping it on the shelf as a staple seasoning.  Love it!
5.0,Awesome granola!,"I love this granola.  I use it in all sorts of ways: straight from the package as a snack, in cereal, on ice cream, etc.  It's the best out of all the flavors"
1.0,MISLEADING- contains artificial sweeteners,"I bought this product because I dislike the taste of artificial sweeteners, so I thought this would taste better than other low-calorie powdered drink mixes such as Crystal Light.  However, as soon as I tasted it I knew there was ""fake sugar"" in it- I could taste the artificial sweetener but could not taste the honey at all.  I turned the package over and sure enough, one of the listed ingredients was sucralose, which is found in Splenda.  I think the label is a bit misleading because it gives the impression that only honey is used to sweeten the product which is not the case.  The box says it does not contain aspartame, which is true, but sucralose is not much better for you and still has an artificial taste.  I didn't like this so I wouldn't buy it again, and truthfully, I would rather buy this product if it was sweetened with ONLY honey or real sugar, even if that meant it had more calories.  A spoonful of sugar only has about 20 calories- if they put one spoonful per pack and each pack makes two glasses of beverage, it would still be a low-calorie drink, it would taste better and would be more natural."
1.0,"Expensive, dogs didn't like it",It was expensive even on sale.  We have 4 Pomeranians and no one liked it. They would only eat if really hungry.
5.0,Was bummed!,"I was bummed that I might run out of this favorite of mine, before I received my next shipment via the subscribe and save program! Really don't tolerate the full caffeine coffee, and love that I can get the 50% (probably should stop at one cup, but can't have just one!), not to mention it has a smooth flavor and just always leaves you wanting just a little more ;}!"
5.0,Yummy healthy snack we love,"We love these. The cheddar carrot flavor is far better than the green flavor. My daughter, age 2, likes them both, but because we snack on them in the car I opt for the cheddar carrot which is tasty to me too. I love that they are healthy and I can feel great about giving her these instead of some brightly colored mystery things. Love em"
1.0,Your kids are NOT going to eat this,"I did not buy this product from Amazon, but did purchase it from a local grocery store. I typically buy organic, whole grain cereals and prefer their taste over sugary over-processed stuff. Not the case with ""Fruitful O's""... this stuff tasted so bad it was inedible. It has a bitter taste, nothing ""fruitful"" about it. It left a nasty after-taste that lingered, kind of like eating dirt (not that I have done that lately). My goats did seem to enjoy it though, so I guess it wasn't a total loss. My goats also enjoy eating cardboard, so... go figure. I can't imagine any child liking this. I think I'll stick with Kashi."
5.0,Nice!,This set included a nice variety of teas and only gave you 2 of each kind so there were many teas to try.  I was also happy with the quality and taste. I would definitely buy this again!
1.0,Meh...So-so,Not to knock this but to be honest the nori was under quality. The sushi mat was really cheaply made but what can i say for the price you get what you pay for *shrugs*
5.0,Intense apple flavor!,"This flavor is difficult to find, but it is an intense apple flavor.  A single 2-calorie piece really packs a flavor punch."
5.0,Very good glueteen free cake mix,This is the 1st Gluten Free cake mix I have use.  The cake turned out very good. The cake did take much longer to cook then the direction had stated. This could be due to the oven being old and not the right temp or could be the cake mix. I forgot to check the temp in the oven.  I highly recommended this cake mix and the cookies from Wow Baking.
1.0,pic is wrong,"pic shows grinder, but this is oil, and is not organic. Don't buy based on pic, but on descrption. I will have to throw it out."
1.0,Any claims of the beef being true Kobe are false,"As one reviewer said, it is illegal to sell Kobe beef in the United States, or anywhere outside of Japan for that matter.  It is strictly regulated, and any claims of Kobe beef being sold in the US are false.  As for ""Wagyu"" beef, that is a certain breed of cow.  Kobe is a particular cut of that breed.  It may be true that meat from Wagyu cows in cuts other than Kobe are available for sale here in the US, but this product specifically states that it is KOBE BEEF.  I would hope that an honest and responsible business would take a little bit of time to do their research before promoting these products."
5.0,"Great Taste, Quick Shipping, Great Overall!","Super quick shipping! I've had this product, and if I didn't know there was no sugar added, I would not have known. It really is good! Thanks!"
1.0,Not what you think,"This is anything but barbeque sauce, more like barbeque liquid. I could have saved my money and bought a bottle of vinegar, and seasoned it myself. This stuff tastes awful a waste of money!"
5.0,Great almond butter with no sugar or salt added!,These packages are very convenient for travel or work.  The almond butter is wonderful!  And it doesn't have added sugar or salt like Barney Butter does.
5.0,perfect for a morning pick me up,This coffee has the perfect balance for a yummy cup of coffee. Love the richness in every sip. I would definitely recommend the Newman's Own special decaf coffee.
5.0,PACKED TO THE GILLS,"My 1st can of these & wow a good spice to them, I eat habanero hot sauce occasionaly & these leave your mouth with a good mild burn, not as bad as habaneros, but spicy none the less ( which I love), this can is the most packed with fish I have ever seen, no floating in a sea of liquid, also no fishy taste & the medium sized sardines, not the big fillet, not the brisling just good meaty medium sized no heads, no tails. I eat sardines every day, so a variety is nice, these will fit into my rotation of favorites nicely."
1.0,Too Sweet,"I have been buying SnackWell yogurt pretzels and thought I'd try these.  Bad idea, no comparison.  The pretzel was just too sweet, didn't taste like yogurt."
5.0,Miracle Berry....,"Just a tad expensive, but neater than heck!!  It really does what it says!  Awesome!!"
5.0,WONDERFUL !,"Surprisingly, this spaghetti tastes just like the regular non-organic, only fresher!  A wonderful find as many organic products do not stand up to their non-organic counterparts.  Definitely a keeper for a very picky past junk food family!"
5.0,SO GOOD WITH LESS FAT!,"I purchased this product a few times from the Newark Natural Foods store located in my area. Sadly the price was insane for just one of these. I use it, I love it, and I stand by this product.Great in protein shakes, baking, and other various dishes."
5.0,Kids love it.,"I was going to wait to review this product until after I've had a bowl of it, but given the response of my young family, I see no need.  The night I had the box of Quaker's Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares in the house, my daughter (who's five) asked for it as a snack before bed. Then after she tried it, she asked for it as a snack in her lunch box.  When my son (who's seven) saw what she was eating, he wanted some too, liked them, and asked for some in his lunchbox as well.  Hard to argue with that reception.  Here's a cereal that not only tastes good (think a heartier and less sweet version of Cinnamon Life), kids like it, and--with 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein--it is good for them too. I recommend it for you and your family.  ** One word of caution, this cereal does have barley in it. We have one family member who is allergic to that particular grain. (Causes mild hives.) You might too, so be aware of food allergy symptoms!  **"
5.0,Superb honey...GREAT FOR HAY FEVER!!!,"Since everyone else has raved about the taste and purity of this honey there's no need for me to add to the chorus. But I don't think anyone has mentioned that this little gem is an ABSOLUTE CURE FOR HAYFEVER. I usually have sneeze ATTACKS beginning in March and lasting all through the summer, esp. when it's time to mow the lawn. I've been taking this honey for the past month and I have sneezed twice, ONLY because I wasn't close to the honey. I take a teaspoon in the morning and another one in the evening and I don't experience a single symptom of pollen allergy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you have hayfever. It's a lot cheaper and better than sudafed or any other OTC or prescription drug."
1.0,Taffy's,"This was the worst item I ever saw.  It was rubbish and I returned it and they did not give me my money back.,  The item was rubbish and the seller even worse.  I will be careful next time I buy something online."
5.0,Two years I have been using Pamela's Bread Mix and I am very satisfied.  The bread is easy to make and very tasty.,"I have added Italian Seasoning,onion and garlic powder to the batter, very tasty.  Scant on the oil."
5.0,Starbucks Snob LOVES Teeccino Java!,"My drip coffee of choice is Starbucks decaf espresso roast, ground for my flat bottom filter and brewed in my Mr. Coffee 4-cup coffee maker.  I am no sissy when it comes to how much grind I use in my brew either; I make it per the package directions.  I've taken note over time that whenever I drink coffee I just don't feel so great.  I decided to give the Teeccino Caffeine-Free Herbal Coffee, Mediterranean Java a try after reading A LOT of online reviews.  Besides, I met the Teeccino folks at Natural Products Expo West in March 2011 and I really liked the idea of the Teeccino brand.  I am sitting here sipping my Java now as I write this.  Love it, love it, love it!  To be clear, it does NOT taste like Starbucks espresso roast.  This is a taste all its own. It is GOOD in my opinion.  UPDATE 06/05/2012 I have tried this hot, cold, black, with half-and-half, with milk & orange liquor, and with half-and-half & orange liquor. It ALL has tasted good to me!  If you are looking for a natural ALTERNATIVE to coffee I think this fits the bill!"
1.0,Not that real grape flavor,"This juice was very disappointing.  First of all it is not really all grape juice.  The additional Natural Flavors, which means it has a glutamate flavor enhancer is scary.  Real grape juice does not need a flavor enhancers. All it needs is all real grapes."
1.0,Ditto - Bring Back the Old Recipe,"I thought it was just me, but now I see that I'm not the only one who hates the new version.  The original recipe had such a delicious aroma, this one smells and tastes artificial.  I have to resort to adding my own brown sugar and maple syrup, but it's still not right.  I will be trying another brand - McCann's Maple & Brown Sugar as someone suggested.  Bad move Quaker Oats."
5.0,helps open airways,"AS A CHILD,THE ORIGINAL LUDEN COUGH DROP, WAS THE ONLY ONE MY MOM EVER BOUGHT. TODAY THEY ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND, HENCE WHY I ORDERED SO MANY FROM YOUR SITE. I GAVE THEM TO MOM,(WHO SUFFERS FROM EMPHYSIMA),FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT.NEEDLESS TO SAY SHE WAS ESTATIC, AS THE ORIGINAL LOUDEN COUGH DROP'S ARE THE ONLY COUGH DROP ON THE MARKET TODAY THAT CONSTANTLY HELPS CLEAR HER AIRWAYS TO HELP HER BREATH. PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPLY THIS PRODUCT. I HOPE TO SEE IT MORE REDILLY IN THE MARKETS SOON.   A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER,   KAREN BOLDUC."
5.0,Great snack,"Our little one just loves these in every flavor. They are very portable and keep fresh in the can. They have less sodium, fat and calories than the adult version of cheese puffs and extra viatmins."
5.0,Great Sugar Free Muffin Ever!!,"I just made this mix this morning and I was alittle unsure of how they would come out since I have had many many sugar free muffin mixes before and lets just say they were rubber, but not these!!! They came out golden outside and fluffy inside. Yum!!"
1.0,THIS IS INSTANT COFFEE,"This is an instant coffee product, and the taste is terrible. I tried different serving sizes and none were worth drinking. Finally gave the box to my husband to take to work to get rid of it. Save your money, it is not good."
5.0,Favorite Dog Chew Product,Top Quality Chew Bone Dog Treat! This Purina product keeps my dogs busy and content!
5.0,Best Curry Powder available.,"I've been cooking all my adult life...and I'm 76 years old, so that's been a lot of cooking. I especially like curried dishes. Of all the curry powders I have used, the SunBrand is absolutely the best...bar none. The blend of spices is perfect. Beats more expensive brands."
1.0,BAD ORDER,"The product I am reviewing is called Bluebird ""UNSWEETENED"" Pink Grapefruit Juice.  Amazon sent me ""sweetened.""  I immediately contacted Amazon making them aware of the mistake and without question Amazon immediately replaced the item.  Unfortunately, Amazon reshipped SWEETENED, AGAIN!!!  I now have 24 cans of something I will not drink because of the sugar content, thus the reason for UNSWEETENED.  I gave up trying to get the correct order from Amazon.  So, essentially, I spent all of that money for nothing.  AMAZON NEVER GOT THE ORDER RIGHT AND DID NOT HONOR IT BY SENDING ME THE CORRECT ORDER OF UNSWEETENED PINK GRAPEFRUIT JUICE OR REFUNDING THE MONEY TO MY ACCOUNT."
1.0,"Worked for 1 season, not 1 year","My fault for listening to false advertising on the radio & not reading the fine print on the inside label. Live in Central FL where we have heavy rain in the summer. Just read on their website that this lasts only 6-8 months in areas with heavy rainfall. Well, I've been seeing weeds sprouting out by my bushes in March & we sprayed this in November.  I wish they wouldn't play their no-weeds-for-1-year ads in areas where that are known to experience heavy rain. The liquid border/edger thing worked better than this, at least there's still no grass/weeds at the edges of my yard & that was sprinkled earlier that the groundclear."
1.0,Save your money.,"I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer here. I have no problem with the unsulfured darkish color of them, but they really don't taste like anything but sugar.  Part of that could be because of the kind of apricot (not California?), but I wish the product was clearly marked in terms of the kind of apricot, since as anyone who likes dried apricots knows, there is a big difference between Mediterranean and California apricots.  In any case, these are simply sweet and sugary lack the fruity tartness of even Sunmaid brand apricots. I hope I can find someone to give them away to because, as much as I love apricots, I can't eat these."
5.0,"Our favorite BBQ sauce, and no High Fructose Corn Syrup","I'm a big label reader at the store, and I must have read 30 different barbecue sauce labels looking for one that doesn't have HFCS as the first or second ingredient.  Bullseye is the only one I've found (it doesn't contain any!).  This fact, and because it tastes really good means it's the only brand I buy.  This original flavor sauce is just spicy enough, and has a nice smoky flavor.  The Kraft website says it ""doesn't contain artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.""  Ingredients include real molasses, tomato puree and natural smoke flavor.  This is the type of product I'm willing to pay more for, but Bullseye isn't one of the more expensive brands.  I signed up for automatic delivery with Amazon, and saved 15% on the cost, and got it shipped free to me as well.  With that deal, you won't find this sauce cheaper even at the big discount stores."
1.0,Black Pepper Chai Tea?,"I have been a fan of chai tea for a long time and occassionally will try different brands.  In my book, a good cup of chai tea does not require sugar and cream, and has tastes of cinnamon, vanilla, and cardamon.  I picked up this box at the local store because it was relatively inexpensive in comparison to most of the other brands.  I also hoped that ""double spice"" meant double the tea servings. I was wrong.  Like other reviewers have observed, the tea tasted very bitter.  An extremely strong black pepper note seemed to overwhelm the rest of the spices.  I have liked other Stash brand teas, but I was very disappointed with this one.  Unfortunately, the box now sits in the cabinet collecting dust."
5.0,German Candy,"The Asbach Uralt Brandy filled Squares with sugar crust, can only be purchased at certain times of the year, due to heat will spoil product."
1.0,Nasty!!!!,This is the nastiest protein shake I have ever tasted and I have tried plenty! I could not even swallow it because it was so nasty. It does not mix smoothly using a blender bottle or a blender. It might make a decent java shake if you mixed it into ice cream but that kind of defeats the point of having a protein shake!
1.0,Didn't buy it,"I just don't understand how these guys are trying to sell 120 bars in bulk for 115 dollars, while Amazon sells 10 bars for 7 bucks. Just buy 12 boxes from Amazon for 84 dollars. I really would like to see this product in bulk though. Nature valley sells 96 bars for 20 dollars. That's what I want from Cliff."
1.0,"Amount of Grains Correct, Shipped Improperly, Grains Appear Inactive","I received the promised 3+ tablespoons of Milk Kefir grains, but the product was shipped in a plastic tub that had nothing, like tape, to keep it closed during shipment. As a result the product arrived in a plastic lined shipping envelope, but the plastic container had come open and what (if any) liquid was shipped with the product had spilled out along with the grains, inside the envelope, with only a few grains remaining in the plastic tub. Simply adding some cellophane tape or shipping tape around the edges of the plastic tub lid/container would likely have kept the product contained properly during shipping. Also the package was HOT when it arrived. The grains ""looked"" large and healthy, if a little bit crushed, however I have tried making milk Kefir 2-3 times since I received the product, according to the instructions included in the shipment, and the milk curdles very little, even if I leave the grains for two days, instead of just one. I'm hoping the grains are still just in shock. Some grains seem to float while others sink to the bottom of the glass jar filled with fresh whole milk, that I cover using a rubber band and coffee filter, so the mixture can breath at room temperature away from any direct light. Also the grains were in large clumps in the shipment or appeared to be, but now have broken down to much smaller clumps. The color of the grains is close to the color of milk. I'm hoping the grains that sink to the bottom aren't dead or totally inactive, but most milk Kefir makers seem to indicate their grains float on the surface or the milk. I'll try making milk Kefir for one more week, but if the milk still isn't curdling, then I'm afraid these grains arrived dead/inactive and likely never will become active. Any buyers should be forewarned that the seller wants you to pay return shipping for a full refund and says they will not reimburse you for this cost, and this must happen within one week of receiving the product. I purchased water Kefir grains from another seller that were shipped with liquid in a totally sealed plastic bag, that arrived unbroken - they have been making water Kefir successfully in the same environment, so I'm certain that the environmental conditions are not a problem, also those water Kefir grains have since doubled in volume (grown). I am not using metal utensils, only plastic, nylon, or glass (jars, strainers).  It's now September 16, 2012. I had to give up on getting these Milk Kefir grains to work properly (or at all). My Water Kefir grains I had received from another seller are now busting at the seems in productivity. They went from 3-tablespoons to 2.5 quarts of Water Kefir grains by this time. I found a website that told you how to gradually convert Water Kefir grains to Milk Kefir grains, and using this technique I now have very effective working Milk Kefir / Milk Kefir grains. They don't grow as fast as the Water Kefir grains, but they do product Milk Kefir that's delicious and viable."
5.0,"Excellent Mellow Tea, Hot or Cold","This tea is excellent!  I like delicate teas just fine, but Stash's plain Honeybush is pretty bland.  The vanilla flavoring in this tea is subtle enough that you may not recognize it as such, but it rounds out and sweetens the flavor of the honeybush to give it a body that tastes like more than just muddled water.  I don't care for most black tea because I find it bitter, and I fancy this my black tea substitute.  The flavor is warm, mellow, well-rounded, and has just a suggestion of sweetness and depth to it. Tazo Honeybush is also delicious, but has weird mystery ingredients (artifical and natural flavor, anyone?  Mmmm!)  Unlike some of Stash's teas, this is also perfect iced or at room-temperature, with no filmy crust of flavoring and tea dust to form on top.  If you have ever liked a honeybush tea, I am confident you will like this one.  The flavor is also similar to rooibos, if you've tried that, but rooibos has a wider range of flavors it can adopt than honeybush does.  Honeybush is always, as its name suggests, just a bit warm and sweet."
1.0,Watered Down!,I thought I would be getting a pure version of Agave at a great price until I tried it. This stuff is so diluted compared to other agave's! No wonder why it is so cheap. Compare it with Volcanic Nectar's Agave Nectar and you will/can never go back!
1.0,Very bad quality,"Last week I purchased this product and after popping a couple of times I threw it in the garbage (all six packs). This popcorn is old, stale, and many kernels has black spots on them. The taste is terrible."
1.0,Saddest looking almonds EVER!,"Ok, so first of all -- the package in the picture says RAW, and received packaging DOES NOT! So obviously is a mislead. The almonds I buy from the grocery store are not organic, cost less than half, and they taste/look far better than these... Sun Ridge almonds are very small, wrinkly and dry... So disappointed, asking for refund, and never buying that brand again! If you think they're great -- you either have never tasted fresh, good quality almonds, or I just received a awful bad batch..."
5.0,So glad I ordered these!,"Best snack I've had since Celiac diagnosis! I sometimes have one as a quick breakfast, too, they're very filling! Thank you, Nature Valley!"
5.0,These are AWESOME.,"Insanely delicious.  Texture and taste are phenomenal, they are incredibly satisfying (and don't leave you feeling mildly nauseous like actual junk food) and the ingredients are just marvelous.  Mmmm mmm."
1.0,disappointing,"Perhaps the worst bottle of wine I've ever had. I'm not even sure I would cook with this. It is thin, no body, and a transparent color not characteristic of a good pinot.  The taste is just bitter - not the complexity that I expect from a pinot noir of any price. Just not what I'm looking for even in a low to mid price pinot noir. Maybe my bottle wasn't sealed well and went to vinegar - other reviews for this wine are favorable."
5.0,Great Gum,This gum is great. It has a great taste and lasts a long-long time. There is not another gum on the market that compares to it.
1.0,You Don't Get The Flavors You're Expecting,I just opened the box... and the flavors inside are NOT AT ALL what's pictured in the product description photo.  I'm really disappointed and feel like I have no recourse.  Money down the drain for flavors I won't drink... and I'm bummed I don't get to try the flavors I thought I would.
5.0,Another great Nylabone product,"I have a very aggressive chewer, and Nylabone products are a favorite in my house.  This one isn't one of the best, but still a toy that will last a long time.  Just what we need here."
5.0,Great purchase,"My fav brand of coconut milk...arrived quickly and in good shape, no dented cans as other complaints.  Will buy again for sure!"
1.0,These are awful.,These bags stink like chemicals when opening.  The smell is horrible.  The taste of the pretzels have the stench as well.  Amazon is shipping a replacement order that will arrive tomorrow.  Will update my review upon receiving the new batch.  1/28/2012- unfortunately the replacement order is the exact as the first. Something is not right with these pretzels. The chemical smell is so strong.  Amazon is refunding my purchase.
1.0,SHORT expiration date,"The case of 6 I received expires June of 2010. Amazon strikes again. I have read about Amazon shipping nearly expired products, but never had it happen to me. I don't know how they get away with it. Description should show almost exired. Very bad business on Amazon's part.   I can live with the short expiration date, I've eaten alot of expired products! All the boxes I've made the potatoes are still hard even after you've cooked it twice as long! So it STILL gets a 1*!!!"
5.0,Zing Zang Bloddy Mary Mix,I Must Say I used to live in Myrtle Beach 4 years ago and this is when I first tried the Zing Zang Bloody Mary Mix!! And I was hooked I would drink a bottle almost everyday Well if not everyday every other day. It Is The BEST!! Then I moved back to my home town Pittsburgh and I was searching every were and I finally was able to find it here I was Soooo Happy!! I have all of my family and friends hooked on this product Never Change the ingredients Or anything about it. IT IS THE BEST MIX ON EARTH. Thank You for Your Time
5.0,Fabulous!!!!!!!,"Once you taste this oatmeal, you will NEVER go back to another brand! I like to make it the night before and let it sit in the fridge overnight, so the flavors of brown sugar and cinnamon (that I add) marinate and it softens just a bit. It is wonderful this way! My whole family is HOOKED!"
1.0,Not up to par for my tastebuds,"I am one of the biggest Starbucks fans and have tried nearly every blend of coffee bean they have.  While I am not a huge fan of flavored coffees due to the nature of the artificial flavoring they add when Starbucks came out with ALL NATURAL Fusions I was intrigued. I have tried all three blends they offer: cinnamon, vanilla and caramel. Caramel blew me away and I loved it and the description on the bag of vanilla had me guessing it would be the same subtle syrupy sweetly decadent taste that I would like. Not even close.  The vanilla did not impress me at all the while the scent of the coffee smelled heavenly and even my kids remarked on it, the flavor was off putting. The aftertaste made me grimace and I slogged my way through the first cup and offered one to my husband who did not like it either. We poured the rest of the pot out.  I took to to work and brewed a pot and two of my coworkers loved it so to each their own. I would not buy this flavor again or the cinnamon but I have bought multiple bags of the caramel.  I am glad Starbucks is making natural flavored coffees and is a leader in the industry by being the first to do so."
1.0,Worst tea I have ever tasted,"I made a mistake of buying this tea during Christmas time and did the ultimate mistake of gifting some of the the individual packs to others. Worst tea I have ever tasted. French vanilla and Key lime tea??  (Really??). Not that the other flavors were any good - for both white and green tea. And yes, as the other researcher mentioned, the jasmine tea is bad as well. overall, a total waste of money."
1.0,Picky Kitty,"My cat deemed these treats fit for hockey games only.  He wouldn't eat them, but had no problems shooting them under my couch."
5.0,Top Quality Dried Bing Cherries,"Dried Bing Cherries are usually quite expensive to buy and can be overly dehydrated making them tasteless and like little rocks. These ones were very reasonably priced and exceptionally tasty and moist. I love them. Yes, they are good for you too!"
1.0,EAT REAL PASTA AND RUN 5 MILES- MUCH LESS TORTURE THAN EATING THESE,"I read about these forever on Hungry-Girl.com and I've always wanted to try them, they rave and rave and rave about them. She obviously gets a kick back from all of the products she markets on her site. I would be curious to see if SHE actually eats these. First of all I will say I can eat almost anything. I can fix taste and I eat diet food even if the taste is compromised, like fat free cheese.  The texture of these noodles weren't the worst part. Yes, they are slimy (almost like noodles that have been sitting in water way to long) because they come preserved in a fluid. So they are rubbery and slimy. Not the worst part though. The worst part is when you open the bag, it smells horribly of FISH- GROSS! I almost gagged. I rinsed them and cooked them in a pan with a little olive oil, cracked black pepper, fresh garlic to try and mask the smell, some parmesan cheese & tomatoes. From the first bite I expected it to taste like fish, but it wasn't a fishy taste. It tastes like you are eating noodles covered in soap. I know that sounds odd. It was NOT my dish, I have tried these a few times (fettuccine, spaghetti and other ones) and each and every time, strong fish smell, slimy noodles and soapy taste.  NOT WORTH SAVING SOME CALORIES AND CARBS if you have to gag the food down. It would be less torture to go run 5 miles and just eat pasta.  You will more than likely lose weight if you eat these, either from vomiting them back up or not being able to eat more than one bite. My appetite was ruined after I tried these. So if you are into some kind of ancient Chinese torture methods of eating then these may be for you."
1.0,rip off,"First of all, one tea bag does not make more than one cup (unless you like the taste of slightly tinted hot water). Second, the price is outrageous. Third, the taste is mediocre. Fourth, where is the list of ingredients?  A list of nutritional values is not an ingredients list! Fifth, the list of nutritional values is for the entire box of tea, not per bag. This expensive tea is a rip off.  Be wise about what you buy and don't buy marketing hype."
5.0,Entirely pleased with this product,"I did a lot of research about the different tuna species sold in canned form -- which are healthiest, which have less mercury, which are overly harvested, etc.  This was one of the few that I feel comfortable and safe eating.  It has a great flavor and firm texture. I buy the unsalted variety.  It's not the kind that dissipates into mush when you add it to things.  I can add it to a stir-fry, casserole, or sandwich, and it always holds together in chunks.  I would highly recommend it.  Also, I contacted the company to ask a couple questions, and they were very friendly and happy to assist me."
1.0,Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter,"Beware.  This is a 16oz jar not 26 Oz jar. A jar of this on the grocer's shelf is 3.19-3.69. I think this item is mis-priced --OR-- the company meant to package 2 Jars together for 8.99 which makes more sense. Otherwise it's delicious!  M in Bethesda, MD"
1.0,Struck Out,"I'm trying to find coffee I can order over the internet for a reasonable price.  The cost for shipping is usually the problem, so added it on to another order to get it shipped free.  The other order came in good time.  It took the coffee close to a month before it arrived.  It tasted like it'd been sitting in a warehouse the whole time; definitely not fresh.  The roast was also not dark enough for espresso.  Poor delivery, poor product.  This was not my usual Amazon experience."
1.0,Yuk,I bought these because Amazon was running a sale and with the subscribe and save they were cheaper than the big pack of Twizzlers sold at Sam's Club.  These taste nothing like Twizzlers and leave an after taste in my mouth. Needless to say I cancelled my subscribe and save. Now what to do with 4 pounds of nasty tasting candy.
5.0,tasty and healthy!,Tastes great plain or with milk.  I like it because it's sweeter tasting and has more fiber than other fiber cereals.  Fiber one caramel clusters are good too.
1.0,Real Customer,"I love coffee.  I have been working with whole beans for over 10 years and this is the worst coffee beans I have every used.  It produces a musty weak undrinkable disappointing brew.  The sad part, I paid over $40. and I can't return it."
5.0,What a great deal!,"Any fan of quality Hungarian or Spanish Paprika knows that it's expensive to buy by the can, especially if you use it regularly.  I use a lot of sweet paprika to make my BBQ rub so I couldn't pass up on this deal when I came across it.  I even gave a few cans to family and friends."
5.0,YUM!,"You can't go wrong with this bold, rich coffee.  This is all we drink around here as far as coffee goes.  Guests always ooooh and ahhhh over it!"
5.0,"Great ""no brainer"" lunch or dinner","Way too good to be a microwave meal.  I was raised on Italian food, and never thought I would like a boyardee meal.  Was I wrong!  Great taste, fills you up just right.  Try it once and you will be hooked!"
1.0,Never ordering cat food online ever again!!!,"I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky. She will only eat the seafood pate of Friskies. I thought the purchase was a great deal since it was cheaper than Walmart and I could have it delivered to my house for a free price. I thought this was a good idea. Well, I was wrong. My housemate and I wondered what that godawful smell was. After weeks of dealing with cockroaches scurrying under furniture and fruit flies perching everywhere, I found out where they were breeding. One of the cans arrived banged up and maggots decided to call it home. You think fresh cat food smells bad? I brought home a premature infant and was afraid of all of the germs that infested the place at the time. I did not want a single risk posed to him getting sick. So I kept him in his room until I found out where the funk was coming from. The moral of this story is unless you don't mind infestation and possible contamination, don't order cat food online."
1.0,nuts,If you go to Costco or Sam's club you will get Coca-Cola 32/12 oz for $10.96 . Same for the 7.5 oz cans (no longer 8 oz by Coke). Why would you do this?
1.0,Yuck!,"I decided to try amaranth flour because it sounded like it had so much good nutritive value to it but yuck, it tasted like wet cornsilk...ick, ick, ick!!  I love Barry Farms selection but they are slow in getting their products to you, and although their quality is good they tack on quite a bit of shipping, but if you can't find what you want anywhere else with less shipping, Barry Farms has a good selection and like I said their quality is good. I will pass on amaranth flour next time though as I could even taste the amaranth flour in my flour mixes.  It had a strong flavor and smell, one that I couldn't get past, so I threw it out.  I'll stick to all my other gluten free flours that I really like and there are others that have good nutritive value as well like quinoa flour."
1.0,balsamic glaze,"Wow, worst tasting balsamic ever. So disappointed in it. Tastes like pure sugar. Will probably end up throwing it away."
5.0,Delicious and low-cal!,"The new Crystal Light Mocktails are a flavorful new addition to the popular drink line. Each container hcomes with 5 packets. Empty into a large plastic or glass pitcher, add tequila, a little lime juice, about 3 cups of water and then some ice. If you are looking for the full margarita experience, a salted glass is a nice touch. Volia! Perfection! With only 5 calories, this can't be beat.  In terms of flavor, it is absolutely delicious. I am looking forward to trying the other flavors."
5.0,excellent feta cheese,This is the real mild true French feta I used to get at the International Food Bazaar in San Jose California and it arrived wrapped really well and in the brine which is very important to keep it fresh.  Prompt service! Will buy again!
1.0,Product Quality lacking,"In one box, four of the ten stix were only partially filled.  I had to use all four to get the flavor of one properly filled stix. I have not yet checked the other boxes but plan to do so and inform Arizona their product quality is lacking."
5.0,Excellent flavor,"The smell when first opening the canister can be strong, however once brewed it is perfect. It is  not too strong of a chai or coconut flavors, but strikes a wonderful balance between the two. I will likely buy the flavor again when this one runs out."
1.0,"Very cheap product, have had to get replacements many times!","I have never reviewed an item before, but taking the time to review the Baby Brezza because of the unfortunate experiences I have had with this product and to warn people not to spend $100 on such a poorly made product.. I read multiple reviews on the Baby Brezza and read some negative reviews about the blade not working. But I tend to go with positive reviews if they outweigh the negative ones, but from now on, I will definitely reconsider buying anything with negative reviews, and the Baby Brezza purchase has actually discouraged me from buying anything from Amazon that is expensive and can be broken, as you cannot return the product after 30 days.  I bought the BB in February 2012 and should have returned it right away after I had some problems from the beginning, but I was too excited to use it so I did not.  1. The cover never fit quite right. The manual said that the blade has two positions, up for steaming and down for blending, and obviously up if you are going to steam/blend but it did not seem like the blade had 2 positions and I always had to readjust the cover to make it fit, turning the blade slightly down from the up position so the cover would close and lock.  2. I bought the grain basket accesory and it never fit! The cover just would not close, it was much too tall! That should have been the final indication that I had a defective BB but it was so much trouble to return the product to Customer Service and I just played phonetag with them!  I was still able to use it for the purposes I wanted, to steam and blend fruits and veggies so I just kept using it for a while til the final third thing happened!  3. The whole thing just broke! The driveshaft and blade just popped off one time! Blade just would not turn!  Called customer service. Terrible experince except for one rep that was really nice whom I had been playing phonetag with. Before I talked to the rep I really liked, the two I spoke with including the manager were rude and unhelpful. Granted, I called when I was upset and was probably mean myself but I thought customer service people's job is to make the customer happy, which I learned at 14 years old at my first job at a restaurant. They argued with me, displayed frustration even mild anger with their voice as well as impatience when I asked if I can get a full refund. They said I would have to return the product and wait for it to be inspected, and maybe I will get a refund. They also said that I could not get a refund on the grain basket as they do not give refunds for accesories and the first rep even argued with me asking if I had left the blade in when I put in the grain basket, which is impossible to do if you wanted to put in the grain basket at the same time.  So I asked to speak with the rep I had been playing phonetag with, and she was really nice, patient, and tried to keep her customer happy. She offered to send a new Baby Brezza without me sending in the broken one, a new grain basket that she said she would make sure it fit, and another free accesory of my choice. The new BB along with the other two products came quickly, few days and so I was a happy customer again!  The new one I received is different from the one I originally bought. The blade was a different color, more brown instead of orange, the driveshaft lock at the bottom of the pitcher was configured diffrently, and the blade had 2 definite positions, up and down, the cover fit perfect, and the grain basket fit. But guess what!  4. This time the blade was broken. It still works but the top part that twists comes off, which I didnt think was a big deal as it still worked but when I was cleaning it, the bottom with the blade part fell off and almost hit my dog! I checked the old BB i had and the top of the blade did not come off so...  I called the nice rep again. She sent me a new pitcher, driveshaft, and blade. She didn't send me any new accessories for my trouble when I asked, but she was still very nice. I did tell her that this new BB is a lot better than my first one and she said the one I have is from a different line, so their product is not even standard!  5. Got it the mail today, the top of the blade still came off! I left a message with the nice rep again but this is now ridiculous. My baby is one year old and I donT even use it as much anymore!  So hence, why I am writing this review. Save your money and trouble and get a steamer and a handheld blender to make babyfood. Oh, I used the grain basket to make small sized pasta like it suggests, not big size pasta. It came out like paste, all stuck together!  And I made same pasta in a saucepan in 5 mins and it was fine. Grain basket took 25 mins and pasta was one solid, pasty mess when it was done! So just boil pasta in a saucepan.  Originally gave  it two stars for the nice rep but changing it to one star. If it was not so cheap and a poorly made product with all the malfunctions, I would have been happy with it. Should have gotten the Beaba fron William and Sonoma, maybe they at least would take back a broken product without me packing it in a box, going to usps, spending money, to get my $100 back! Or they should only charge $40 for the BB, not $100 or have the accesories go with it for free! I guess that is what you may get with products made in China.  Addendum: my husband just told me that he noticed there is water leaking in the back when it is on steam mode, when the first one did not do that. It seems like the second BB we have has a new set of problems. When I decided to buy the Brezza earlier this year (2012) there were only a few one star reviews compaining it did not work. I just read the current ones and there are so many one star reviews complaining of the same defects I experienced or different ones that really scare me like oil leaking that I donot want to use this product anymore. I would not have bought it if  I was reading the same reviews back when I decided to buy it. I am goIng to call Amazon to see if they can issue me the refund. It is near impossible to get a live person on the Brezza customer service and they do call back, but it takes a while and it is so incovenient. And with a product like this that you use a lot for only a limited amount of time when baby eats babyfood, it is really a rip off to not just send someone a replacement right away. Planning to call Amazon to see if they can take a look of how many complaints there are of this defective product and not sell this product anymore. It is a disservice to loyal customers of amazon. Makes me want to stick to brick and mortar stores so you don't have the inconvenience and frustration of not getting a refund or a replacement immediately. Maybe for some people, $100 is nothing but for us, $100 was an investment of a product I was planning to use well into my baby's toddler years to sneak in pureed vegetables in their spaghetti sauce like the BB site advertises. Cannot do that with a poorly made product that is only on warranty for a year!"
1.0,Tastes like eating margarine,"I bought based on all the positive reviews.  The first couple of truffles I thought tasted pretty good but after the 3rd or 4th, I rapidly lost my appetite for it.  The rest of my family lost interest after one or two as well and no wants to eat anymore so I chucked the rest in the trash.  Was anyone actually able to finish an entire box???  Yuck."
5.0,Great Mac & Cheese,I love this product. Great taste and I like being able pronounce (and know)all of the ingredients.
1.0,:(,I just got this coffee a few days ago. I had coffee with this bean yesterday and today morning. I can't like this coffee even if I'm trying so hard to like this coffee.
5.0,Cowabunga!,"Our little rat terrier can usually make a ten minute snack out of the biggest rawhide treats. This thing has kept him very busy for three to four days on a refil, and the main ingredients are not nearly as likely to clog his pipes.  The inserts force him to clean his teeth, and he cannot put it down. Does not seem to even be interested in chewing the container. Looks hocus, but I tell you, this thing is GRREat!"
5.0,great tasting,"Great tasting, mild brew,great way to start your mornings.I would recommend this product to all tea drinkers.Try it you will like it."
5.0,Rave Review!,"What's there not to like??  I am not a ""chip"" person usually, but was looking for something yummy that would do justice to my homemade hummus.  These fit the bill!  Nutty, crunchy, full of flavor, fiber-rich.....even provide a protein punch with 4g per bag.  Will put these babies on subscribe and save!"
5.0,The BEST sugar replacement on the market!,"I've been using Fat to Skinny Zero since it was first introduced. It's the first non-sugar sweetener that actually tastes like SUGAR! It's a remarkable product - I would not steer you wrong. There is absolutely NO AFTERTASTE! It doesn't give you a tummy ache like some sweetener products can, and the food prepared with it tastes like it was made with regular sugar. My mouth is SO HAPPY!  I use it for candy, cream-cheese cake frosting, beverages, cakes, desserts - anywhere regular sugar can be used. I keep a bottle in my purse and use it on the road as well. (Don't leave home without it!) It's a keeper!"
5.0,Cheap and tastes great,"I was expecting this to taste horrid based on other reviews, but it really does taste good compared to other protein powders. It's not an earthy or ""green"" taste like some people are saying, much more similar to the taste of sunflower seeds. I've used soy, rice and pea protein powders in the past and this hemp protein definitely tastes and mixes better than other products I have used.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone lookng for a better tasting, easier to digest alternative to other protein powders."
5.0,Taste great!,This product is cheaper than if you can find it in the stores. It's easy to make and taste great for adding flavor to foods or just use as gravy.
5.0,My Favorite,"I have been buying this item ever since I first purchased it at Costco a few years ago. Costco stopped selling this procuct and then I turned to Amazon. This oatmeal is far better than the store brands or Quaker Oats. It does have some added sugar, but it is not too sweet. Great Oatmeal."
5.0,Better than most,"Pure protein, no sweeteners or flavors but tastes great. It tastes like malted milk w/o the sugar. That most protein powders are sweetened flies in the face of trying to be healthy. You don't need the additives and you certainly don't need to train your body to always crave sweets. The best part is that, without any flavoring added, Jarrow's Whey Protein tastes delicious with plain milk."
5.0,green tea for weight loss,"I have never taken a green tea supplement before this one, and my experience with it has been pretty good.  The good news is that I did not feel any negative side effects but I was taking this for weight loss and I did not lose very much weight at all while on this.  When I began taking raspberry ketones along with the green tea,  Green Tea Extract 60 Capsules (500mg) + FREE 25 Grams Raspberry Ketones Powder , this is when I started to actually lose weight.  I read an article that said taking them together created synergistic weight loss effects, and so far I have lost six pounds in the past 17 days compared to just a couple pounds when I took the green tea on its own.  There are a lot of good health benefits to be had by taking green tea on its own too but for energy and weight loss, adding raspberry ketones to the mix has been great."
5.0,"Buffy loves 'em, no sugar, last awhile","These are supposed to help with dental health - I'm not sure about that, but they don't have added corn syrup or sugar, and they take a few minutes to chow down. Buffy, Princess of Goldens, loves these and takes each daily treat out to the front yard to roll on before consuming - high praise from her. My vet recommended them over the usual grain, fat, and corn syrup based treats. This is one of the few treats I'm comfortable with giving daily, it's not doggie junk food."
1.0,Horrible After Taste,"This product taste strongly of salt substitute.  I was looking for a low sodium product, which this is, but it was a waste of money, as we hated the taste.  Yuck."
1.0,Terrible,"I am by no means a coffee expert, but you would have to have a string of mental conditions to prefer this ""coffee"" over mud in a cup.  The taste is terrible at best, no amount of sugar and cream added makes it more tolerable, and quite honestly, there is a reason why Via sells better.  IT TASTES BETTER.  For several reasons I might add.  You can get it in a variety of flavors, so finding one you truly enjoy isn't difficult at all (unlike Taster's Choice), Starbuck's spent an incredible amount of time and effort perfecting the instant coffee while Nestle appears to have pulled theirs outta their lower back.  Long story short....if you like coffee, don't even try to settle for this.  If, however, you have no love for coffee, and are solely interested in a bit of caffeine, I guess this would suffice, but honestly there are less disgusting ways to get it (apples for example)."
1.0,just found out,"it is sold for less than $3 in the supermarket, but here, more than $11?! just found out about it a few days ago. people don't make the same mistake in the future"
5.0,coconut oil =),"iuse this to deep condition my hair, and it makes it SUPER soft =) im starting to run low, so im going to go ahead and order more =)"
1.0,What you see is NOT what you get!,"Seriously???? I ordered the Oceanspay 10 count White Cran peach.... I was sent 6 boxes of the 10 count powdered drink tubes.  The advertisement featured larger product one could use to make a 2 gallon batch. I can buy boxes of powdered tubes at Kroger for 2.50... essentially, I paid $26 for what I would have paid either $21(not on sale) or $15(on sale).....NEITHER Of which is what I actually believed I was purchasing because I wanted the 2 gallon container mix.... not the product use for bottled water tubes."
5.0,GOOD STUFF,I love Goldfish - you can eat a little or a lot - plus this size will last me for a long time.
5.0,Great product!,"I was a little hesitant about ordering this product as I had seen a few of the reviews mention flimsy packaging and older/dated versions of the product.  But, my food co-op stopped carrying oat bran in their bulk section and the stuff at the grocery store is prohibitively expensive, so online shopping it is!  When it arrived, I found the packaging to be just fine--no spilling or ripping, and I have been able to use the original packaging as the default storage container with no problems.  As far as taste, it tastes like any other oat bran I've tried.  Which is to say, it's pretty bland, and a good vehicle for other tastes. I like to add nuts, chopped apples, and a bit of cinnamon to mine.  I haven't noticed any bad taste or aftertaste.  Will probably buy again when this supply runs out!"
5.0,Best Herbal Tea Ever,"I have been drinking Celestial Seasonings herbal teas for as long as I can remember, and I have always found them to be pleasantly flavored.  A few years ago, my supermarket had the Gingerbread Spice flavor on the shelf in November - I had never heard of it, but it looked good (who can resist a tea with cookies on the box?), so I tried it.  I LOVED it.  Pleasantly flavored would have been a vast understatement - this tea is DELICIOUS.  And it smells wonderful.  It takes me quite a while to consume 20 tea bags, so some time passed before I was ready to restock.  Much to my dismay, the supermarket only carries this flavor during November and December!  I had to wait until the holiday season to get it again.  Imagine my joy at discovering that Amazon now offers Gingerbread Spice all year round!  What a happy surprise!  Now I can drink my favorite tea whenever I want it.  I enjoy Gingerbread Spice with milk, but find that it is quite sweet enough without adding any additional sugar.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys herbal tea."
1.0,Not what we wanted,Recieved the order twice but got the Gluten free style. Hate the taste and want the regular old Nances Mustard we grew up loving.
1.0,Doesn't taste all that good,Pro- It was on sale so it was pretty cheap.  Con- Taste is weak and very light. No real flavor.
5.0,AMAZING,"These are so delicious, I had to buy lots of them.  Regular BBQ sunflower seeds are just coated in stuff and the flavor disappears after they've been in your mouth for 2 seconds.  These are actually soaked in amazing flavor, so you actually taste BBQ (and a little kick of Jim Beam).  SO DELICIOUS!!"
5.0,"Rich, sweet, full-bodied coffee from a k-cup","Despite giving Emeril's Big Easy Bold five stars, I think it only fair to open with a couple of negative points. First, if you're looking for authentic New Orleans style coffee, you'll likely be disappointed by the lack of chicory root. Frankly, I doubt that most coffee drinkers will mourn the lost chicory. Second, this coffee is a concentrated dark roast; if you're fan of light roasts and mild coffees, this variety will probably taste ashy and too strong.  We just started using our Keurig B40 last week, and the first few k-cups I tried were disappointingly watery. The Emeril's Big Easy Bold is one of the few blends I've found that provides a full-bodied cup of coffee without any harsh overtones and without any nasty, bitter after-taste. Made with a single varietal (Colombian-grown arabica), Emeril's Big Easy Bold brews up with a rich cocoa aroma and a thin trace of crema. The flavor includes caramel, chocolate, and fruity notes with a hint of pepperiness, but the chocolate note lingers in the finish.  I don't add sugar or cream to my coffee, but I doubt that either addition would detract from the overall experience. Excellent with scones."
1.0,Worst food experience ever.,"I bought this sauce at a local grocery store eager to make a pesto dish. I opened it hearing the pop, meaning it was properly sealed, and lo and behold inside was a LIVE beetle. Threw the bottle away. Makes me shudder how many other jars are infested with bugs and larva."
5.0,Awesome stuff,I've been drinking this for years.  This is a great way to order it - much cheaper than buying in the local grocery store.
5.0,"Excellent, But The Cost is Too High.","San Diego tap water smells a bit and leaves a lot of white crud in the glass if evaporated dry. But, what the hey? Why should I buy supplemental minerals if Colorado River water already contains a good variety? In any case, the city says it's safe and I know of no problems. Well, my wife feels differently about such matters. She's from Europe and nobody there supposedly drinks tap water. Disgusting. Drinking water must come in a bottle and be collected from some important and well-known springs. Besides, she seems to have elevated senses in taste, smell, sight, hearing and all other senses. In any case, to keep peace in the household, I agreed that we would drink bottled water. We gradually settled in on Kirkland Signature bottled water. The price was right! Well, now even that isn't good enough. My wife seems to have discovered Fiji Natural Artesian Water which comes in attractive rectangular bottles and is imported all the way from the South Pacific. It costs several times as much as regular brands, but that's part of the appeal. It's the best, she claims. It's so smooth and goes down so easy, she says. Now other bottled waters, although OK, are not nearly as good. No, Fiji Natural Artesian Water is the water for her. I must admit that it's excellent, but the cost is way too high.  Gary Peterson"
5.0,Outburst Energy Bites,"I absolutely love Outburst Energy Bites. The Chocolate Mint flavor is delicious! Definitely recommend. I usually pop a few in the mid-afternoon when I am getting tired and they actually work to help me get through the day. They are also great for working out, for a little extra boost."
5.0,Toothless cat loves it,"Our cat, an elderly fellow missing most of his teeth, isn't too picky.  He still enjoys his kibble, which is usually Atta-Cat from Costco, but he LOVES gravy so I subscribed to get a case of this every month.  The pouches are faster and easier to open than a can, and I like being able to give him a variety of flavors.  He seems to get most excited about the beef and the turkey.  After some experimenting, I now give him one of these Friskies pouches in the morning along with some kibble, and just kibble at night.  He typically eats 100% of the gravy and 70-90% of the chunks.  There's a lot of gravy in the pouch so make sure you squeeze it all out.  Good to the last drop!"
5.0,Hard to find cobbler mix is my family's favorite!,"I have been buying this mix locally for about 10 years, but they were always sporadically available. About 2 years ago the last store in town that was most reliable stopped carrying it altogether.  On occasion I've found the mixes in a country store here and there and I would buy all their stock. Lately I haven't reliably found it in any stores anywhere.  Finally gave up on the stores in the area having this mix and checked online.  The company's website wants some ungodly amount with a ridiculous shipping price. Luckily it was available on Amazon for around $2 per bag of mix, which is about what we were paying in the stores locally.  The family has made a variety of home-made cobblers and clafoutis, but we always preferred this one. We use canned fruit or fresh. If you follow the directions on the package you get a perfectly molten and crispy blend of fruit and cobbler. For fresh fruit you get great results by making a simple syrup to soak the produce in(and if you prepare it according to cooking orthodoxy it makes it that much better).  The 12 pack is great, but we must have gotten the last one since they are currently not available. Will definitely be ordering more if they are restocked at a comparable price."
5.0,Excellent treat!!!,This was a fantastic treat that was truly enjoyed by everyone!! What I liked most about this candy is that each piece was wrapped by itself so you could just enjoy one or more if you really wanted too!! It also made for a nice grab and go treat!!
1.0,Not Raw,Whether it tastes good or not is not the issue if someone is looking for a raw almond butter.  This almond butter isn't raw.  I got some almond butter imported from Italy & it is delicious.
1.0,vanilla beans,I did not care for this product!!! It is a weak bean.The vanilla specks didn't show in the homemade ice cream.The vanilla flavor was very weak even when I put extra beans in the custard.I would not recommend.
1.0,Horrible,This popcorn is the worst popcorn i've ever had.  It smells horrible!!  It also made me a bit queezy afterwards.  I would not reccomend this
1.0,Dented String Beans,"Yep i have been getting cases of string beans for 9 months now, and every case i get, has atleast 10 dented cans in it,, Do they know how unhealthy this is, I have cancelled my service of this, Please DO NOT feed this product to your children... Sad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,Franken-beef!,"[...] [...]  Links to prove its a bad thing.  Just like injecting poor and old cuts of meat w/flavor to make them look good.  PLUS adding extra weight.  Did you know real meat isn't RED, like in the store.  If blood is drained properly, it is brownish.  A green sheen means it's rotting, but red meat is just dye."
1.0,Not for a really agressive chewer,My dog loves to chew!  I figured a product created specifically for dogs that love to chew would be perfect.  Rocky actually ATE this bone.  And then proceeded to throw up pieces of nylabone the next morning.  Horrible!  If your dog is an agressive chewer do NOT purchase this product.
5.0,Great raw almonds,"These almonds were just what I was looking for. They are raw, which I wanted, they taste great, and were fresh. I would buy these again."
1.0,Not Very Good,"I will finish the bottle, but won't order it again. Very artificial/chemical tasting. I do not recommend this flavor at all"
1.0,Nothing new or notable,"I was unimpressed with SWITCH WATERMELON/STRAWBERRY. It's just another entry into the sparkling juice market--a market that really didn't need another brand, especially not one lacking in anything new or interesting.  Like all the other sparkling juice drinks, its flavor comes mostly from apple and grape juice concentrates; the flavors on the label are only a small part of the ingredients list. The result is that this doesn't really taste like watermelon OR strawberry.  Instead, it fits some food scientist's ""flavor profile"" of those two tastes, kind of watermelon-ish, kind of strawberry-ish, but lacking in both. The flavor is just not anything to shout about, and no better than the other products on the market.  I'm also not sure why it's called SWITCH. I guess it's a marketing thing--they want people to ""switch"" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. Well, I know that *I* won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink."
5.0,If you love pistachios you will really go nuts over these.,"These nuts were absolutely incredible. They had a perfect crunch and the flavor knocks you over. Sometimes raw nuts can be bland  , but not these. Next time I will order more than 2 pounds. I used them in smoothies , in salads and chopped them to add to my husband's paleo cereal. They are also delicious when lightly toasted and sprinkled in with veggie or meat dishes. Shipper got them to me very quickly!"
5.0,Dr. Chew Sweet Potato dog treats,"We have a pure breed dog who is allergic to almost everything and can't eat most dog foods and treats.  After trying every kind of veggie, no wheat, no soy, duck, etc. treats and spending copious amounts of money only to find that he won't eat them, the only two kinds of treats in the world that he will eat are Milkbones (go figure) and Dr. Chews!  He LOVES Dr. Chews and they have only one ingredient, sweet potato.  Cooked, sliced, sun dried sweet potato.  They're full of fiber and vitamins and they don't stain fabrics.  The only concern we have is that they are made in China.  We found no negative history on this product (although we are not professional researchers) but we are still careful to give him only one at a time and let a day or two go by before he gets another."
5.0,Nature Factor Organic Coconut Water,"I've tried a few different coconut waters over the past month or so - drinking during/after a long run to replenish electrolytes.  I won't go into the health benefits of coconut water in general here as I'm sure there is plenty of that information available elsewhere.  Specific to this product however, I have to say it's one of the best I've encountered.  I wouldn't desire coconut water (any brand) based just on it's taste, but this one tastes the best of the 4+ I have tried (including O.N.E.). It actually tastes fairly good chilled during a long run.  The container is easier to use while running on a treadmill than the cartons that other products come in also.  The fact that it is organic is nice too - I couldn't find any other organic coconut waters on Amazon.  Everybody's taste is different, so order a few different products and compare to see which one is best for you - but Nature Factor Organic is definitely worth trying."
1.0,very disapointed,"I was very disapointed in this product, it use to have a good solid layer of current paste throughout the center creating 3 layers. It now has a scant amount of current paste througout the cookie. Now there is no layers just 1 layer with a bit of current paste here and there, leaving this product almost tasteleess."
1.0,Not worth it,"This item was extremely disappointing.The boxes were damaged. The boxes were filled with filler (paper, styrofoam, etc) to make them look full and therefore there were very little sweets in the boxes! Not worth the price for the amount of goodies. Would have returned it if I had received it earlier, but unfortunately I didn't and had to give it as a birthday present anyway. It was embarassing! Don't waste your money on this."
5.0,Great for our Fifties Party,"We had a sock-hop themed party, and we ended up getting enough of these for just over one pack per person - that is 6 boxes, 144 packs - they ALL went!  Folks thought they were a hoot!"
1.0,Occassional Scorching is Unpalatable,"While generally a fan of edamame and wasabi, I found the seasoning of these beans uneven and dangerous. The occasional powerful bean was fun, until I ate one more concentrated than any mouthful of western wasabi or capsascin I had ever had. It was beyond unpalatable - to the point I gagged uncontrollably and had to spit out the beans, leaving a trail of fire out of my mouth. As colorful as that sounds, it is not an exaggeration. It's been five minutes and the burn sensation lingers. Not enjoyable. I had to throw out the bag due to the negative association. Eat with caution, especially while driving."
5.0,Excellent Tea,This brand of Jasmine Pearls is just as good as the brands available at Teavana and Whole Foods for $4-6 per ounce.  Absolutely no difference in taste or quality.  Highly recommended.
5.0,Yum,"5lbs of Raspberries is a large amount. For comparison's sake, think of a 5 lbs baby. Now imagine that baby filled with Haribo Raspberries. This is the amount of candy you'll get. Can you handle it?  I've given some to friends and family and still have a lot left over for myself. As soon as the product arrived, I stored the majority of the candy in a large air tight jar, and a smaller supply in a more accessible jar on my desk. It's been 10 months since I've ordered it, back in June 06', and the candy in the large jar is still chewy and fresh. I would say the shelf life on this candy is very long, given it's properly stored.  Superb product with nice texture and in my opinion, just the right amount of sweetness. The interior is gummy but it's not sticky and won't cling to your teeth."
5.0,"Great product, Fast shipping!",I looked all over the internet for high quality corn silk tea and finally found it.  I received my product promptly and the price was great. Thank you!!
1.0,Do not buy this coffee,"This is a waste of perfectly good coffee beans.They are roasted light-medium and is very bitter...undrinkable.African coffee should be full-city/dark roast.I do know coffee.I have roasted my own and at first made the mistake of not roasting it enough.The result tasted like this.I would not have bought this for myself.I bought it for a friend and am now going to have to eat the $32 I paid for it,not to mention looking like an idiot.I am not happy.Coffee bean direct will not in any way rectify this,nor will Amazon.I am a prime member"
1.0,Not sweet at all.  Very tart.,"I'm not sure why they would call this Wild Sweet Orange.  It's not sweet at all.  It's very tart.  I'm not a tart tea person.  Even with a packet of sugar it still wasn't sweet.  Also, this tea tastes more like lemon than orange which I should have known based on the first ingredient being Lemon grass.  Really not happy with this at all.  Will likley just have to throw this out.  If you don't mind a tart lemony, citrus essence tea it might be okay for you but not what I was expecting at all based on the description."
5.0,Tips on Use,"I ordered these direct from the manufacturer in Spain. They work great in the Nespresso Essenza C91. With this machine you have to stop the water flow, it does not stop automatically. So using these Necaps are easy, you will not get a diluted shot unless you let it run too long and this applies to Nespresso capsules as well. However your shots may come out a little short due to the Necap not holding the same amount of coffee. The Necap will also deform due to the heat from the hot water. This is normal. I like using these very much. Making them is time consuming but then so is going to the Nespresso store to buy originals or going on line. If you want to save money and have time to do this then give them a try.  Tips: Pack the coffee in tight using the bottom of an empty Necap. Don't do it so tight that it is like a rock. You also need to use espresso grind coffee. It does not have to be espresso beans, any bean will work but the coffee has to be ground on the finest setting for espresso machines.  1. Set out several Necaps 2. Use a funnel to fill to top, tap side of funnel to get coffee to go down. 3. Use bottom of empty Necap to compact coffee. Press firmly. 4. Fill up to top again and compact. 5. Put foil on and you are done.  You can also reload your Nespresso capsules using aluminum foil as a new cover. Cut the old foil away, rinse, clean out the used grounds, re-pack with new, place foil over and pinch tightly around rim of nespresso capsule, trim excess foil away. These can be used over about 2 times.  Remember to run some water through the machine to heat your cup and clean out any left over grinds to get a nice tasting cup of espresso.  My coffee makers that I have used are a T Fal drip, several different sized Bialetti Moka Express, an Aeropress, french press, my grandmas old perculator and currently the Nespresso Essenza C91. I have also made cold brewed coffee. All serve there purpose in different ways."
5.0,Never felt better,"I looked into this product for a friend who has cancer. The information sounded so promising, I decided to try it once for myself. I have mixed mine with a super-green juice every morning for about 10 days. I don't feel hungry, I haven't had headaches, best of all I don't hurt anywhere. I'm 55. I've had pain somewhere for years. I've added this to my daily routine like I did with vitamins years ago. I thought it would be good for me...I never expected to feel this good."
5.0,Excellent Quality and Value,I've been drinking lots and lots of tea over the past few months as I work through a low carb diet regime.  I had been buying varieties at the grocery store and decided it would be economical to simply buy a large sampler.  With that in mind I randomly chose Bentley's Finest Tea Classic Collection.  I couldn't have been more pleased with the quality of the tea.  The peach tea is in fact my favorite in the collection but the English Breakfast Tea made me a fan of that flavor where I never had been before.  I'll be watching for other tea collections from Bentley's.
5.0,Yummy!,"I should of bought two bottles of Melinda's and saved on shipping because I have been putting this delicious sauce on everything.  Not as spicy as I thought it would be, but it taste great with a good burn.  It burns much more than any store bought sauce I have tasted."
5.0,DELECTILICIOUS EXPERIENCE,"As this gum doesn't appear to be available locally, I am pleased to have discovered it at Amazon online. It tastes great and lasts quite well. The actual pie should taste as good."
5.0,favorite tea available for my Keurig,You can't beat the convenience and the tea is strong enough you can get a double volume on one keurig cup.
5.0,Very Good REAL Wasabi - Highly Recommended,"Sushi Sonic ""100% Real Powdered Wasabi"" is just that, real Japanese Wasabi with no additives. The product description was a little confusing but the bottle states ""Ingredients: 100% Wasabi (Wasabia japonica)"" and no other ingredients.  The 1.5oz (43g) jar contains roughly 17 servings when mixed with water as per the directions. The wasabi is a fine light green power that on its own is fairly mild tasting. It mixes it into a paste fairly easily and does not tend to clump, but don't be lulled into complacence by the complete lack of ""heat"" immediately after mixing as it will develop a respectable wasabi kick after sitting 10 minutes or so.  I really enjoy the flavor and it is more subtle than the normal horseradish based ""wasabi"" found in tubes and most Sushi restaurants. I think it is worth the extra expense for special occasions, but for everyday use the normal wasabi will do for me.  Note that this is a ""Product Of China"", which might be a concern for some people.  Highly Recommended!  CFH"
1.0,It's not pure kombucha,"No wonder this stuff tastes so good- look at the ingredients! It's not pure Kombucha; they blend it with normal tea, sugar and flavorings. I'm heart broken. :("
1.0,Yuck.,"I was so excited to finally find this in a store near me.  I ran in, paid my $6.99 for a pint and dug in with a spoon while sitting in the car.  All I can say is I was seriously disappointed.  This is chocolate flavored water ice.  The chocolate flavor isn't enough to satisfy any type of chocolate craving.  Even at 32 calories a serving I thought it was a waste of the calories. I had a few bites then put it down to try and let it melt to get a little more flavor. It wasn't any better.  I pitched this in the garbage, having probably eaten only a dollar of my seven dollars.  Here is what I learned from this experience: if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. Don't waste your time or your money."
5.0,Frontier Tortilla Soup,I ordered this tortilla soup and haven't tried it yet.  It sounds so simple to make and it looks so good. Can't wait to try it.
1.0,It Is NOT capachino!!,"Capachino is to have some milk in it, flavor and coffee, this is just flavored coffee. I do not see how they can eve call it capachino? This has no milk at all (my package of Kcups didn't). The coffee is OK but since it claims to be capachino I give it one star because it does not even vaguely taste like capachino."
5.0,Amazing how much the size of the bite impacts its appeal!,"My Shih Tzu, Missy, had pretty bad tummy problems (vet says food allergies) for the first two years after I adopted her in 2008.  Then I discovered Natural Balance products...specifically the limited ingredient and allergy formula products. Since switching Missy over to all ltd ingredient/allergy formula food and treats, her stomach issues have drastically reduced to the point where it is now occasional and manageable.  Missy has been eating Natural Balance Sweet Potato & Fish for some time, but recently I discovered this ""small breed bites"" bag in our local pet store and decided to give that a try (Missy tends to like treats and food in small bites).  WOW, what a difference.  It was a food she already liked...the exact same brand and flavor...the only difference was the size of the dog food pieces...and yet she attacked it with a fervor I could not believe.  More often than not now, she eats ALL her food...not just grazing off the top.  This morning, I was happy to find the small breed bites variety on Wag.com, and have already ordered a bag, along with some of the other great Natural Balance products Missy loves (and I love for her).  Recommended!"
1.0,"Received expired product, check ""use by date"" if you order","I received a 5 pound bag today, March 9, 2011 that had a ""use by 2/2011"" on the package.  When I contacted Amazon they credited me back the charge. Great customer service but would be hesitant to order this product again. If you order it I suggest you check the ""use by"" date on the packaging.  Opened package, had a strong chemical/plastic smell, tossed it in the dumpster."
1.0,Made in China and bad for the planet,"I loved the taste of this product but just noticed they are made in China.  I contacted the company to get more information. They said they test for quality but in fact the list they gave me was for bacterial contaminants only. They do not test for lead or other heavy metals, just salmonella, aflatoxin and microbiological testing. And they do not own the factory, they just contract out the production and inspect the factory.  As for the ingredients, some of them are from China, such as the malt syrup. And the US ingredients are shipped all the way to China, the product is made, then it is shipped all the way back. This was to cut costs according to a business journal report on the company. I hate to see what the carbon production is for each bar based on that practice. And for the price they sell the product for, which is quite expensive, this way of saving a buck speaks poorly to the company's ethics. I for one will no longer buy this product."
5.0,Flavor vs cost,"I agree with the other reviews on this being the best of the best on vanillas. It is an exact ratio of taste to bite and perfect for cakes and cookies as well as other vanilla uses. The cost for this quality seems in line with today's market.  While you may have paid less a few years ago. you also paid less for the price of gas and water then too! The most important aspect is it is a true extract, you use less for more flavor, so it is a true savings!"
1.0,Terrible,"These are terrible. I normally buy and love the Black Forest gummies but thought I'd try these because of the variety of flavors. What a disappointment. There is little to no difference between the supposed ""flavors"". They don't taste juicy, like the Black forest. They taste sugary and acidic but not fruity. Worst of all, there is an underlying bitter, chemical taste to them that just completely ruins it. They do look pretty, but that's about the only thing they have going for them."
1.0,"AWEFUL seller, Good product","this was the first time I've ever had a problem ordering off of Amazon. Suppose to be a 12 pack yet they only send me a 6 pack and then take 2 weeks to respond back to my e-mails. When they do respond they try telling me that the $52 price is for the 6 pack and not the 12 pack and the 12 pack is $102, I might as well go to Starbucks everyday at that price (I NEVER go to Starbucks fyi). the tea arrives in a flimsy cardboard case with the receipt of sale taped up on the box making it impossible to read once opened unlike ordering directly from Oregon Chai's website that packs everything in biodegradable peanuts (iirc they are made from cardboard as well) keeping everything safe, neat and organized."
1.0,"Shame on obscuring the weight, highlighting the ""bargain"" price.","One of my cats has become diabetic and I must have some dry food on hand so that I can leave home for a long day [wet food after a bit gets dried out and won't be touched].  Was just at my local pet store, saw this, but thought I'd like to look at reviews first.  Then, when I saw the price here, I thought terrific as the 6.5 pound bag at the store was about $20.  Nearly instantly ordered a bag [""free"" shipping]. Thankfully, folks here pointed out the miserable two+ pounds for close to $15.  When I went back to the page with the photo I noted that the weight was not displayed there and had to find it neatly tucked away from obvious view much further down.  Pfui."
1.0,This product tastes terrible!,I love the Asian Pear and Fuji Apple freeze dried fruit so thought I'd try the Mandarin orange crisps.  I was unpleasantly surprised by the bitter taste of this product.  Four of us tried it and none of us like it so I will throw the remaining pouches away.  Waste of money.
1.0,DO NOT BUY! TASTE LIKE CR@P,This is the worst tasting chocolate bar ever. I think if actual poo has a taste this would be it. Nasty!!
1.0,tastes terrible,"This stuff is way too expensive for what it is. I mean, seriously, how do people actually eat this. I had it this morning with some poached eggs and even a healthy amount of hollandaise couldn't make it taste good."
1.0,Produced in China,"The Amazon listing makes no mention as to the origin of the product. The label on the container indicates that the garlic is produced in China and packaged in the United States.  Given reported concerns about Chinese foodstuffs, I would not have purchased this product had I known it originated in China."
1.0,Just plain old Decaf,"I tried these with my JV/Melita Pod unit and they produced bland, unexceptional coffee.  Considering they cost the equivalent of about $20 a pound, you might expect more, but it is just ordinary java."
5.0,The Peppermint Room,"Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado. The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags. The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored. Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas. He did not tell us what was to come.  The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us. We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room. The smell of peppermint was overpowering. It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint. What a rush! The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry. For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.  I am now addicted to Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea. Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder. The events of that day have changed my life forever. Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet. I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer. On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour. Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon."
5.0,Awesome wet food,I first tried this out at my kennel at work. It smells so nice and is nice and easy to scoop into unlike the cheaper wet foods. And the ingredients are quality. I give my dogs this mixed with their kibble now.
5.0,Country Harvest Healthy Choice,This popcorn tastes so good and it is made with sunflower oil which is healthier.  We make this popcorn in our popcorn theater machine and everyone always wants more!  Great product and the portion size works perfect in our machine.
1.0,Where's the chocolate?,I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.  The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.
1.0,Not As Good As Before,"The new Ritz is not the cracker of old.  Poorer taste, and so crumbly you'll be lucky to find anything but crumbs when you open the box.  And forget putting peanut butter or soft cheese on the cracker, you'll break/crumble the cracker trying that."
5.0,5 Star Product!,"My hair is very dry and my scalp is very prone to dandruff. Usually without an extensive dandruff treatment that leaves my hair really really dry, my dandruff never goes away. Washing it will sometimes make it better for a day or two, but that's about it.  This is first shampoo I've tried that doesn't dry my hair out AND gets rid of dandruff. I usually wash my hair every 7 to 10 days. I haven't had a dandruff problem between shampoos since I've been using it, which has been about a month. It feels good on my scalp, leaves my hair soft, and it smells good, too. ^_^  I think is probably best for anyone with dandruff or a problem with excess oil or product buildup on the scalp.  The conditioner that goes along with this is equally impressive."
1.0,Horrible,"This tea is horrible. The product has a dirty laundry smell and does not taste much better. I expected better from something so expensive. It is simply not worth it. Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.  Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern."
5.0,Awesomely tasty and filling!,"These are a perfect breakfast on the run or anytime snack. Tasty and filling! But I got them at Kroger for $3.00 per box, so this is a bit expensive, even with free shipping. Check your local stores first, but don't hesitate to try them. I'm not a big blackberry fan, but it is mild, not too sweet or tart and the graham crust is very flavorful, if you like Graham Crackers, you will like these."
5.0,Great Sumatra Flavor & Easy On The Stomach!,"I have always been an avid coffee drinker, but after gastric bypass surgery I've had little tolerance for my old brands.  My sister turned me on to Senseo and their Sumatra blend, and I am a very happy coffee drinker again.  This one has very nice flavor and less of the acid of my old favorites.  I'll be sticking with this one now that I've found it!"
5.0,Delicious Glaze,"The black cherry flavor tastes  pretty good.  Although my assistant taster and I did not care for the orange Switch, we  like the black cherry.  Most people are preconditioned about orange flavor. It is supposed to taste a certain way, but black cherry has more freedom to be individual.  I discovered a wonderful way to use Switch black cherry -  cooking salmon!  I mixed the Switch black cherry  in the blender with a half cup brown sugar and a tablespoon of honey.  To that I added a shake of Chinese five spice, a shake of  ground cloves, and approximately 1 teaspoon of dry mustard.  I mixed that in the blender.  I sprayed a baking pan with butter flavored cooking spray.  Then I placed boneless salmon  - about one fourth fish - in the middle of the pan and surrounded it with slices of peeled pre-baked sweet potatoes.  The liquid from the blender went on top of  all of it.  Into a hot oven (450 degrees) went the pan.  As soon as the liquid bubbled, I carefully turned the salmon over, basted it with the glaze, and let it cook five minutes.  While it was still in the pan, I cut it into two servings, topped it with pecan pieces and returned it to the hot oven  another two minutes to heat the pecans.  It was pretty on the plate!  I poured some of the glaze over it.  Yummy!  Switch black cherry would be nice in ham glaze too.  Mary Lou Cheatham (Jane Riley) Author of Flavored with Love: Mary Lou's Family and Friends Can Cook"

5.0,Tasty soup fed our family for about $7,"Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup fed our family of four for about $7. The directions called for 8 cups of either water or milk; my wife added 4 cups of each. We enjoyed the soup with buttered bread.  One package of soup: $3.17 (we saved a couple dollars on a promotional deal) 4 cups of milk: $1.80 8 slices of bread: $1.40 Butter: $0.55 Total: $6.92   Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup  is tasty. We added a couple drops of  Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce  to each bowl. As I mentioned earlier, one package fed us all, including our two sons (ages 9 and 8). If you have two teenage boys, you probably should make a second package to fill them up.  The soup's ingredients are: dehydrated potatoes, chopped onions, parsley, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, wheat flour, hydrolyzed soy protein, lactose, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate, chicken fat, salt, dipotassium phosphate, turmeric & silicon dioxide (added to prevent caking).  These are the preparation instructions on the package: ""Empty contents into medium saucepan. Add 8 cups of water or for a richer soup add milk. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken, remove lid and let stand for 5-10 minutes. (A crock pot works great.) You may want the soup to simmer for a couple of minutes so the little potatoes can soften.""  The package also lists these variations: ""For a great chowder, you can add jack cheese or mozzarella and the add oysters, clams, or throw in some corn. Garnish with bacon bits and for color, add some chopped pimento.""  In summary, this is a suitable (and affordable) meal for a fall or winter day. The potato soup is good by itself but I encourage you to try the variations recommended by the company.  Rating: Five stars."
1.0,"Unsafe chemicals in this ""detergent"" bar","Dove Beauty Bar should be called ""Dove Detergent"" so it doesn't deceive people into thinking it is a soap  (just look at some of the reviews that call it a soap).

1.0,Sadly Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in this product.  I was expecting the rich, hint of sweetness of quality dark chocolate. My senses were assaulted with a sickening sweet, unpleasant taste of sucralose with no detection of the richness of dark chocolate.  If you are a lover of dark chocolate, this is not the product for you.  The exorbitant price lulled me into thinking this would be made with quality chocolate and real ingredients.  Alas.."
5.0,My Cats Dig This.,"My cats are fish cats, they do not eat any meat or poultry. For some reason it makes them gassy, nasty. Plus I feel a bit better about only having to kill one type of animal for them to survive, in this case, salmon. Having fed my cats the dry version of this food in the past I figured I would give this a shot. There was no complaints from my cats, they ate it all. I like giving all my pets foods with limited ingredients so Natural Balance always seems to work for us."
1.0,gra44,"I ordered 2 grape fruit spreads, and I received 2 blueberry fruit spreads instead. I could not send them back because they had been opened. The spread has a good flavor."
1.0,I feel BeanBoozled,"I got a call from my mother-in-law last night thanking me for her birthday present I ordered here. She thanked me for the surprise and also had to comment how terrible they tasted. She asked me if it was supposed to be a joke on her. I said no and felt bad a 93 year old lady ate some bad jelly beans.  Won't buy again,  Steve Baker"
5.0,Organic lollipops for the kids...,"Yummearth makes the best organic lollipops we could find, so we are constantly buying them here from amazon. price and quality are always good."
1.0,Picture Perfect Gumball Machine,"I was very disappointed in the quality of the picture and frame.  I guess I thought I would get more for $25.  Paying $9 for shipping and handling I got it within two days which was great, but I would have preferred cheaper shipping for a few extra days of waiting; however, that wasn't an option that I could see anyway.  I wouldn't suggest this product unless you don't mind spending $25 and giving it to a kid that doesn't care about quality.  I was buying it for the grandma of my children for Christmas."
1.0,Where's the beef (i.e. tuna)?,"The taste is ok but I could hardly find any tuna in it - I did discovered small scraps of it on the bottom, but the content was mostly pasta.  Don't waste your money."
5.0,My dogs really love this dog food,"I recently switched to this dog food from Nature's Variety Prairie.  So far I am very pleased with the dog food.  When switching, I was looking for a certain range of protein and fat and Merrick Whole Earth met the requirements I was looking for (a protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 14%) and chicken meal and turkey meal is the main source of animal protein.  The dog food was also ""highly recommended"" by an independent dog food advisor site that I use.  My dogs really (really) like this food and they eat as soon as I put it down (even their morning meal which is dry food only), so the taste of this food must really be to their liking.  Despite the fact my dogs are rescues (and who knows what they were eating when they were wildly roaming the streets), they are picky and with the Nature's Variety, half the time they never ate their breakfast.  Also, I have large dogs but for some reason they like the small dry kibble and this is kibble is on the smaller side.  I have also noticed a positive change in their stool.  It is a little firmer and a bit smaller, meaning they are absorbing more and eliminating less.  I actually really liked Nature's Variety while they were eating it but so far I think the switch was a very good one.  ****PRICE INCREASE UPDATE: I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER THAT THE PRICE INCREASE EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST WEEK IS AN ISSUE AS THE PRICE FOR THIS FOOD HAS ESSENTIALLY DOUBLED.  I MAY BE WRONG BUT THIS APPEARS MORE OF AN AMAZON INCREASE AS MY BACKUP FOR BUYING THIS DOG FOOD IS PETCO AND THE 8 POUND BAG IS CURRENTLY SELLING FOR $10.42, ABOVE BIT ABOVE THE AMAZON PRICE INCREASE BUT WELL BELOW THE CURRENT $16 FOR AN 8 POUND BAG.  SINCE I LIKE THE FOOD (AND MY DOGS LIKE IT) I CAN JUST BUY IT THERE."
1.0,These noodles are horrible :(,"The shipping of the item was superb.  They came packed very securely.  But the noodles were just awful.  I guess I was expecting the noodle to be more ""pasta"" like.  I'm just glad I didn't spend more money on this product."
5.0,gluten free pasta,The best pasta on the market for those who need gluten free. And it is a great price. We will keep buying from Amazon for our gluten free needs
1.0,A Shame!,"The new canister idea went a little too far, as there is also some thing different with the taste. They dont even taste like onion any more, very bland. Not the same French's that we have grown to know and love over the years. This is a true shame. Hopefully, some one will realize that and do some thing about it. If it isn't broken, don't fix it! Bring back the old caniser with the real original flavor please, my taste buds beg of you!! Thanksgiving this year will not be the same......:("
1.0,DISGUSTING STUFF!,"I had really high hopes for MTR products, given the high reviews I've seen on Amazon. I bought a 5-pack of this Paneer Makahani, and it's just disgusting. I am very passionate about Indian cooking, and cook Indian food at least 4 times a week (and am an Indian myself). Firstly, MTR seems to use the exact same sauce base for all the curries (I bought the Mixed Vegetables and it has the same revolting flavor base), and the sauce is just not right! If you tell me that it has Indian flavors, I won't disagree with you. But Indian spices need to be used better - they must be matured properly by cooking them off in hot oil, adding aromatics in the right amounts, etc. The paneer was absolutely bad quality and tasted like rubber, the pieces were minuscule and lost in the river of bland, disgusting sauce. Paneer Makhani is one of the most beautiful north Indian dishes, with a nice and smooth, creamy tomato-based sauce, and a base of tandoori but mild spices. This one is grainy, the sauce is pungent, and it's just disgusting to be brief. All in all, it can be a poor man's emergency meal, but no way on earth does it even REMOTELY deserve the number of stars it has! Very very bad food indeed .. =("
1.0,Dead in 2 weeks,Plant arrive in a protective box looking very healthy.The soil was very wet and within a few days the branches rotted away. I repotted what was left of the plant but it was too late. I have purchased from this company before with great results but will never purchase live plants from them again.
1.0,Waste of money,The flavor in this gum lasts less than a minute.  I couldn't tell if it quenched thirst because it was so tasteless I spit it out.  Total waste of money.
1.0,Small Bites are No Bites,"My dog HATES this dog food. She turns her head away from it and refuses to even put it in her mouth. I bought a 1-lb bag at a local pet store(I thought they were treats) and she LOVED it. But they were not small bites. There is something different between the regular and small bites. The only difference mentioned on the labels is duck, but my dog loves duck. So, it must be something else. I don't know what it is, but my dog knows. I bought this 5 lb. bag as treats to sprinkle on her more nutritional mainstay brand or to hand feed because she loved the one from the pet store so much. But I'm not even going to bother with this stuff. I figure there has to be a reason why the dog hates it. So, bottom line, I got bagged."
1.0,Disgusting.,"I am well-versed in all things dairy-free. I eat tons of dairy replacements, most of them quite good substitutes. This is by far the worst tasting substitute I've had. It doesn't come close to replicating any kind of cheesy flavor. It's a bit like peppery cardboard and smells like vomit. Use your dairy free budget and ""splurge"" on the Amy's frozen Vegan Mac & Chreeze. MUCH better."
5.0,Delicious tea,"Another delicious Rishi tea. The vanilla mint doesn't overpower the chai, so it the tea has a nice balance to it. I appreciate the package of three tins--I can go through this tea pretty quickly!"
1.0,"These contain corn syrup solids, dextrose & sugar! toxic to dogs!","If I could give these treats and a whole bunch of others 0 stars, I would.  They contain among their first ingredients corn syrup solids, then dextrose and a little bit farther down the list sugar.  Sugar and other forms of sugar like corn syrup and dextrose are linked to cancer in dogs.  They're just as bad if not worse for them  than for humans.  Sure the dogs love them; but there are a lot of healthy treats out there that are just as well liked.  You're buying the name brand, advertising and packaging."
5.0,Creamy Deliciousness,"I have tried this tea several times, as well as others from this supplier, and found it rich delicious and creamy. The fragrance isn't like ordinary teas, but full and rich in a way that was completely new to me. Great stuff!"
1.0,Horrible,"I'm giving this  one star because the price increased by $7 and I was subscribed to this and they shipped it to me for that amount with no notification! I was subscribed to both flavors. That's b.s.  If you're going to change the price, cancel all the subscriptions too! Its some scam"
5.0,This is absolutely amazing!!!,"Trying this, it was very good because you got a sense of what it is really like to make sushi instead of going to a restaurant.  What is even better is that you can have fun when you make it."
1.0,Ants just go around,"We've put the product in several locations and the ants just seem to mosey on around it. . . Really struggling to find a safe, pet-friendly product to help us. Just hasn't happened yet. . . . NOT ONE single ant has gone in to the house. Just sayin'"
5.0,This is delicious!,"I have eaten this many times.  It is delicious and would highly recommend it.  I always add rum and serve with sour cream.  The best.  Add a salad, good bread, nice wine and it is a perfect meal."
5.0,Can't beat the cinnamon intensity of these,I first bought these at Whole Foods and enjoyed them immensely.  I now keep them at my desk for when I need a pick me up while working.  Definitely a snack-type essential for me.
5.0,Good,"Of course this was good. It's Sirloin Burger. Buying in bulk is a great way to save money and I didn't have to worry about this product. Trusted brand, good product."
1.0,This has artificial flavor.,"This Fresh Fruit Spry gum has artificial flavor, and the taste is not that great.  The Spry Spearmint gum is naturally flavored and really tastes great."
1.0,HORRIBLE!,Do not purchase these. They are not normal or approved k-cups. They contain an instant mix that is supposed to dissolve into the water as opposed to a standard filter system. These were melted into a solid sheet on the bottom making them useless! Not recommended.
5.0,Too Tasty!,"I had purchased a box from our local grocery store here called farmer jacks because they are on sale 10 for $10, and they are To DIE for! If you're a doughnut fan and like chocolate coated ones these are for you! I had the devils food crumb doughnut ones and wished they sold whole boxes of these. No funny aftertaste either."
5.0,"Yummy, organic, and baby loves it!","My 10-month-old really likes her Mango Baby Brekkie, and who could blame her!  I tried it myself, and it's very yummy!  Plus, I can feel good about giving it to her for breakfast because it's organic, nutritious, and has no added sugar, unlike many other brands of similar baby food items on the market.  This product is a nice way to give my little-one a healthy combination of foods -- organic mango puree, yogurt and brown rice cereal -- in one neat package, without the need to open/peel and mix the all the ingredients by hand!  A great option for busy households during the morning ""rush."""
1.0,Nutricity is the VERY WORST EVER place to order from,Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order.  I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic.  I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns.  When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email.  I will never ever order from them.  I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them.  When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item.  And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email.  VERY DISSAPOINTING!  DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.
5.0,Delicious,This is the best Prickly Pear cactus candy!  It's not too sweet.  Just right and has lots of flavor!  I wish I still lived in AZ so I could pick some up more easily!...and frequently!
1.0,"Chewy, rubbery dough","I usually buy Aunt Jemima, but I was craving Pancakes and the store didn't have AJ, so I bought a box of Hungry Jack. Never again. When cooked the pancakes were like I mixed water and flour; they were very chewy and unlike any pancake I've ever had or made."
1.0,Small print- made in China,"My dogs love these treats and by reading the label you think they are wonderful. HOWEVER in really really really small print at the bottom of the package, it says made in China. I don't trust anything made in China and will not be buying this product again. Seems Dogswell is not proud of this fact and aware it is a problem also, otherwise why would it be in such small print and at the bottom of the package? Maybe if everyone complained about a product from China, DOgswellwould be forced to have it made here in the USA. Its not like its low cost or anything."
5.0,Great value,"I had always bought this in the retail stores like Safeway, Von's or Albertsons but they quit carrying it.  The value here is great.  I paid the same price for 24.5 oz as I used to pay for 8 oz.  I'll by all my spices on line from now on..."
5.0,Delicious and natural,"These are very good cookies. They are in no way comparable to homemade though, whoever said that is smoking crack. But for store bought, these are excellent."
1.0,Not very good,"Doesn't taste like bubblegum, or anything else I've tasted.  Gave them another try and ordered the cotton candy, a little better.  Going to try a different brand."
5.0,Lizano Salsa,I have been trying to find Lizano Salsa in stores for many years. I discovered that I could buy it from an on-line company and was very excited to find that it was reasonably priced and just what I was looking for. It's a favorite in Costa Rica where it is found in every home and restaurant.
5.0,Muir Glenn is excellent,this brand has been a favorite of mine for years now. Everything they make is very good.
5.0,Wish I could find them in north Texas,"These are so delicious.They are so smooth and rich without being overwhelmed by spice.I hate to have to buy a whole case,as it is just me.But they are so good ,it just might be worth it."
5.0,Great purchase!,This chipotle is wonderful - has that authentic smokey Mexican taste with a good amount of 'heat.'
1.0,Big surprise,"This product had a lot of great reviews, so it was a big surprise to find it really was not a good product for me.  Although the baked goods made with this flour tasted good, with a nice flavor, it did not knead well, and refused to rise well.  So the bread it made was good-tasting, but with terrible texture.  I tried more than one thing to make it work, and more than one recipe. All failed, and the common element was this flour. I used it in a bread machine, and it didn't work. The dough did not come together into a ball, but remained crumbly, almost like cookie dough. Everything was right, and the recipe was a proven one. All ingredients were measured correctly, the proper yeast (fresh and in perfect condition) was used, and used correctly, but the dough would not come together well, nor would it rise well.  My wife also tried to use it in homemade recipes, using our big stand mixer to knead the bread, but that bread also failed. Again, she used proven recipes, but with this flour, had poor results.  Finally, we tried mixing it into better-for-bread flour that had proven its worth many times... but even 1 cup (1 cup out of 4) caused the same problems... poor cohesiveness in the dough (where usually when the best-for-bread flour is used, you get a nice velvety ball), and a low flat loaf.  The results were consistently bad... no matter where or how (even only mixed in a little into some better flour) or how we used it our breads failed."
1.0,Greenies Dental Chews For Dogs,"Consumers Beware of Greenie products for dogs or cats. It contains a very toxic ingriedant called, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite {MSB},which is a synthetic {man made} form of Vitamin K3 and causes cancer, organ damage {kidneys,lungs,liver,and mucous membranes}.

1.0,Limited  Flavor,Just tried this item and found it lacking in flavor and oil. The best flavor I have found is buying the sesame in the store as a 2-3 oz plastic package and toast them in my toaster oven. Sun Luck - Toasted Sesame Seeds 3.75 Oz. 
1.0,Rainforest blend coffee,"Did not like and sold it to a friend. It has that ""burnt"" flavor like coffees from the popular coffee shops. I prefer milder flavored coffees."
5.0,Cats will eat,"I mix this with their other soft food. Overall, I like that it's healthy, so my cats will have to deal with it until they like it."
1.0,DONT buy this product!!!,"I love Watermelon! At work one day, a friend offered me a Dunkin Donuts Watermelon coolatta. I didnt think I would care for a slush drink - but it was fantastic and soon, I was buying one every day. I have a home snow cone and slushy maker, so I went in search of a good Watermelon Syrup.  I tried Monin, Torani, DaVinci, and Best Bargain brands Watermelon syrup. Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.  Avoid these products like the plague!!!  Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the ""Contact Us"" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!  Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!"
1.0,Bland - what am I missing?,"I love Greek food and was excited to find this product with all the positive reviews since I don't cook a lot.  I took one reviewer's advice and bought some at Wally World at a considerable savings.  My first (and probably last) attempt was chicken breasts, chick peas and sweet onions in a slow cooker.  I poured on the seasoning as I added each layer (onions, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning, chick peas, seasoning, chicken, seasoning) to the extent that I though surely I had overdone it.  The result was tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  It's not that it wasn't flavorful enough, it was flavorless.  I confess that I grew up in a household where we ate ""world food"" all the time, we just didn't know what it was because we had no cable TV and there was no FoodTV back in the dark ages anyway.  I live in an area where authentic ethnic food is everywhere.  Maybe my taste buds are completely fried (I do like me some spicy hot anything!) but to me this has less character than a moderate sprinkling of plain old black pepper, which is no character at all."
1.0,No positive effects experienced,"Before buying this product, I read some of the other reviews and felt pretty assured that this product would give me the energy boost that I wanted. I bought the 12 pack to have a decent amount to try.  I am a relatively well built six foot 215 lb guy and decided to drink one bottle before working out. I felt absolutely none of the energizing effects promised by the manufacturer. I tried this a couple of times, and each time I expreienced the same result. I then decided to drink 2 bottles to see whether the dosage might be to blame. After drinking two bottles I noticed that my heart beat increased and that I had difficulty in trying to catch my breath, but again none of the energy benefits promised.  I still have a few more bottles which I will probably finish, but I do not think the results will be any better. I guess you need to try it for yourself in order to see whether this formula complements your bodies chemistry. It certainly didn't complement mine."
5.0,Excellent value,"Great value, tastes as good as any tahini I have bought but for a third of the price. Definitely recommend!"
5.0,Most Delicious Tea,This tea is absolutely delicious!  I stumbled upon it a few years ago and it is my favorite!  It also was the only tea that I drank while I was pregnant because it settled my nausea and is organic and is caffeine-free!!  The flavor is so light and delicious!  Just a dab of sugar (or not) is all it needs!  Very fragrant tea!  Thank you Davidson's!
1.0,Loaded with sugar!!!  False advertising!!!,"I have bought various coconut waters and assumed this was pretty much the same. First, I tasted it. Awful. Then I looked at the package: 15g sugar per serving, and sneakily notes that there   are ""two"" servings in this little box...30g of sugar!!! No mention of that in the description - they even claim it can help you lose weight. Shame!!!"
1.0,really bad,"This stuff tastes awful.It tastes sour and  kind of artificial. The consistancy is disturbingly glue-like. I tried to mix it with olive oil since I hate throwing away food. It did not help, so a full jar went to trash bin."
5.0,The best for cooking,"Nutiva does not make a bad product. I eat a strict Paleo eating regimen coconut oil is all I use for baking; well sometimes Ghee. I brush coconut oil on chicken breasts, sprinkle some hemp seeds on top, a bit of black pepper and then bake. The coconut flavor is not overwhelming it just sneaks in there. I also use coconut oil when I saute my spinach; also adding black pepper and hemp seeds. I am finding this the new oil in my life I really enjoy it."
1.0,Not good.,"If you even like this product...the bottle design doesn't allow one to effectively shake up the ingredients before pouring therefore you get all oil right off the top. I suggest pouring it into a bowl and whisking. It contains xanthan gum but it wasn't effective as an emulsifier. No one flavor stood out but I could taste the canola oil. I like tart and this isn't. With the sweetness of the fig, a bit more acidity would have balanced it out. I found the flavor cloying and unpalatable. I even tried adding wine vinegar to it but it didn't help. It ended up sitting in my refrigerator for over 6 months. I finally used some to baste the top of a pork roast and poured the rest down the drain. I still can't figure out why they added caramel color when balsamic vinegar is already dark and so is fig paste. Also, I bought this on sale (it was a discontinued item) at my store. I asked one of the managers why it was was discontinued and he said usually it's because the product was not a good seller. I can see why."
1.0,Bleh -- not what it used to be,"Campbell's Chunky Clam Chowder used to be one of my favorites.  No longer.  The current offering must use a new recipe.  The former sweet, creamy taste is gone.  It is now runny and has an funny, kind of peppery off-flavor.  Reminds me of the BP oil spill.  Includes crunchy bits of shell or sand.  I ate a couple of spoonfuls and threw the rest away.  Ugh.  Never again."
1.0,Peach Cobbler mix,Calhoun Bend Mill - Peach Cobbler mix... I'm very disappointed in this mix - I used fresh peaches too........but 7 min. before it was suppose to be done it was already too brown & over done.....I really don't care for the taste also.
5.0,Earth's Best is simply the BEST Instant Oatmeal !!!,"I have been buying this cereal for my two little boys since there were one and now they are almost 3 and they still love it just as much! I mix it with organic milk and it is a really good healthy breakfast for my kiddos. If you buy it from ToysRus or BabiesRus you will pay about 3.49 per box, which is the cheapest I have found.  Here is a link:  [...]"
5.0,Simply Amazing.,"Unlike the other reviewer, I find this coffee to be simply amazing. I, too, am an American and I have NOT grown up on the coffee. It was a chance finding for me when a friend and I ran out of coffee and this was the only thing available at the store near our apartment. Since that chance finding, all we have wanted to drink is this particular coffee.  I have never tasted a coffee so smooth in my life! It really is delicious. And I feel the cardamom adds a wonderful, lingering aftertaste. You really will be hard pressed to find a smoother coffee. I have converted some non-coffee loving friends into having a cup when they come over to my place simply because this coffee tastes amazing."
5.0,Great Product!!!,"This product came highly recommended. As a some time sugar addict, I can promise you, this stuff is very good. And you don't need to use a whole lot of it."
1.0,yogi Peach Detox,"bought this because of the 'Peach' in the name of the product. Should have been labeled 'Cinnamon' as that is the only flavor that comes out. There is 'NO' discernible Peach flavor. very disappointed.  Yogi Peach DeTox, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) "
1.0,Almost Nothing in there,"There are only 3 truffles. There are pieces of toffee. Ridiculous. chocolate covered peanuts and popcorns were a bit more plentiful (a handful). When looking at the photo, don't look at the boxes, but the chocolates shown because that represents that actual quantity."
1.0,12 bags of expired chips - NOT GOOD!,I ordered 12 bags of these chips in September and when I got them I found that the sell by date was 10 May 2011. What disappointment!
5.0,So Good why isn't it Bad???,"After a couple of days to try out these 2 Peanut butter substitutes (the regular and chocolate versions) I can say I'm a convert. I LOVE peanut butter, for me it's a trigger food. If I eat it, I tend to want to eat half the jar at once and it can lead to wanting to eat other things I know I shouldn't. I've worked damn hard to shed 170lb this past year and half and indulging in PB is something I very rarely do anymore. I'd all but given it up. So actually finding something like this, which will allow me to enjoy the occasional PB&J sandwich without the feelings of guilt and remorse is a godsend! The reg. version of PB2 does have a roasted peanut taste to it, so it's not quite like regular PB, you don't get the salty sweeter taste of Jiff or Skippy. JUST the roasted peanut taste. But it's quickly adapted to. And the Chocolate version (which I was more skeptical of) was even better! You can eat either one right after you mix them with water, but I think they're best when added to something else. First of all I like to mix a base of reg PB2 with the chocolate version since I prefer a bit more of the nutty flavor to the chocolate. When just eating the chocolate my first thought was this would be great on whole wheat with a smear of marshmallow creme. And I don't even like marshmallow creme. But I will probably try it out one day to see if I'm right. Either spread works great on fruit. I've tried apples and bananas so far. I also tried a PB&J with reduced calorie jelly and it worked very well. Good enough to replace the high calorie reg. PB&J sandwiches.  It might sound strange but one combo I REALLY like is to scoop a bit of the powdered PB onto a fat free potato chip (I use Pringles fat free sour cream) and no there wasn't a taste clash or anything. I'm sure you could use the reg Pringles fat free, I just happen to think the sour cream ones taste better. Anyway turn the chip upside down and scoop a bit of powder into the ""bowl"" of the underside and eat. The salt of the chip is the first thing that hits your tongue and then the PB powered crumbs. And the combo is just....yumm!!!! Like that, it really does taste like any PB you could buy. I tried it with the chocolate version too, and there it's really like eating a peanut butter cup. And surprisingly the salty chip and powered PB isn't dry in the mouth. Quite the opposite actually. Now on the other hand, I tried adding the powdered PB2 as a topping to my skinny cow ice cream as I do on occasion like some melted PB on my ice cream, but there it DID dry out my mouth completely. Very strange. So I decided to try and mix the PB2 with water then heat it up in the microwave to see if it would melt like reg PB. It didn't. It got hot, but ended up dry like the cookie dough for peanut butter cookies where you can basically ball it up in your hands. I guess without all the fat the PB2 can't melt like standard peanut butter. So as for ice cream topping, at least so far, it hasn't worked. I am looking forward to seeing what else these 2 powdered products would work with and am already planning on ordering the larger sizes as I'd like to try some baking with them too.  All in all, I highly recommend them!  Edit; Okay so it DOES work as a melted peanut butter substitute on ice cream. The key is to start with a base of water and gradually add powder to it until you get a very creamy consistency that will run off a spoon, just like melted pb *then* heat it up in the microwave. My first attempt with this method I used far too much water so be careful there. I kept adding bits of powder including the chocolate version for fear I'd use all my pb2 up. But it was so much water I couldn't thicken it up enough and decided to start over. However, rather than just throw it all out, I decided to try it out as a drink. And you know, heated up, it was like a super rich cup of cocoa....delish! Even with no added sweetener it was sweet enough. And as a plus, since it's just water you can save those calories there. Not to mention, if you're lactose intolerant like me, regular hot chocolate is out anyway.  Now even though this stuff is 85% less than regular peanut butter it does have some calories and fat, so I wouldn't over do it. But as an occasional indulgence, I'm so happy I found this!  PS: I just want to add since purchasing PB2 from Amazon I've found a site called ""netrition.com"" and I highly recommend buying food stuffs from them. Amazon is great for pretty much everything else, but they are way over priced on their food. I bought the large 16oz pack of PB2 from netrition for only 7.99 per bag. the same price Amazon charges for the small 6.5oz size! They don't have free shipping like Amazon, but they only charge $4.95 flat shipping fee no matter how much you buy. So it's not bad. Maybe because I bought so much, or it was my first time ordering but they also sent me a free low cal. quick cook cake mix. They were also way WAY cheaper on PB2 peanut butter crackers and everything else I ordered from them.  So like I said, Amazon is great for most things, but when it comes to food. Netrition is a whole lot better!"
5.0,Great!!,"My hubs and I have loved these for years...good poured over a block of cream cheese and eaten with party crackers, great on hamburgers, etc. we love them. The hint of sweet helps with the hot!!"
5.0,my favorite,"This is my favorite breakfast coffee. Very smooth, no bitterness at all. I would rather have a cup of this than a to strong cup of starbucks."
5.0,Yummy,Hard to find a whole wheat product.  Very tasty.  Tastes even better leftover after pasta has sat in sauce
1.0,"Amazon ships balanced nutty, not what I ordered","I ordered 6 bags of Medium Colombian Coffee, when I started using it I noticed differed taste, then I read carefully the label on bags, it showed balanced nutty Colombian Coffee, this is not what I ordered, I do not like its taste."
5.0,Good food,This butternut squash taste good!  Love the portability of these pouches.  They are messy to open.  I use scissors to cut below the ziploc line so I don't have to deal with it.  The ziploc is nice though if you are going to have leftovers.  We never do.
5.0,Garbage,"Some of the reviews of this product that is.  The pineapples are excellent, and I may be ordering them regularly.  The pineapples have a nice yellow color, they have a nice fresh no-added-sugar taste, and in the pack I received none of the cans had the slightest dent."
1.0,Taste like a sugar free product,I tried this after a co-worker said they were good. One sip and you can taste the sucralose. Gross. I hate that taste. Waste of money. Gave them to my co-worker.
5.0,Best Tuna I've Ever Used:  Please Make It Available Again,"I love this tuna.  It tastes great and is packed in olive oil, which is a big plus for those of us who like flavor.  I wanted to order more today, but it apparently isn't being sold because some people had complained about it.  I read the reviews from some disgruntled (probably overly picky) people who were upset about the consistency of the tuna.  While it may be that you don't always get a solid chunk of tuna or sometimes it's packed a little looser than other times, you still get a whole can of tuna instead of a fourth of a can of flaked tuna and three quarters of water like the regular cans.  I am really bummed that I can't order this right now because of the complainers of the world.  If you don't like it, nobody forces you to order it.  I hope Amazon has the good business sense to make this available again as soon as possible."
5.0,Good deal for the price,"I was pleased with the order.  There is a definite difference between this and ""fake"" cinnamon. Taste fresh.  i just hope a pound will last for a while.  I put it in everything I can."
1.0,Made in China,These bars are high in sugar and hard as a rock and they are made in China!  So who knows what is really in them!  Why doesn't Amazon disclose the country of origin?  Why doesn't the company disclose country of origin on their website?  Shame on Mrs Mays.
1.0,"Forget the time saver, add a  couple of steps for a much better product!","First of all, I can't understand why this is so expensive since it's less than $2 in the grocery store. But anyway, I bought a couple of these when they first came out and were buy one get one free. Made the cinnamon ones to take to church this morning. I didn't pay attention to the nutritional listing and didn't know that they only made SIX muffins! Who packages a muffin mix to only make 6? The container is tall so that you have room to shake (I realized after opening it) and it gives the illusion of having much more in there. So... to try and stretch it out to look like more, I made a  batch of minis for the small group that I meet with. The really bad part is that you can't scrape the batter with a spatula like you can when it's in a bowl. You can easily leave a whole mini-muffin in there! I have a skinny spatula that I had just bought, so I was able to get most of it but it was terribly awkward and I still left some batter. It makes me wonder if these things are tested out in a college dorm. After cooking I drizzled white icing and shook out a cinnamon/sugar mixture on top. That's the only thing that made them special, as they would have been pretty plain without the topping. Needless to say, I wouldn't buy again."
1.0,Not as good as other Pacific soups,"I love Pacific Natural Foods organic soups, especially the creamy tomatoes and butternut squash. But this cream of mushroom soup has no flavor at all. I went with the 12-pack based on my confidence in the brand. Now I am stuck with 11 packs of bad soups."
1.0,Melted mess,"UPS just delivered this, and it was a melted mess.  It's not a big circular box, as pictured, but a rather small, rectangular box (with perhaps half the chocolates as pictured - if wrappers count).  And when we opened the box, what we found was a box of chocolate sauce.  No individual piece survived.  What a mess.  ADDENDUM:  I complained of this Saturday evening.  By Monday afternoon they processed a full refund, including shipping fees.  Guess it was just a fluke."
1.0,Useless for cluster flies...,"If you're buying this device for cluster flies, save your money.  We've had it up for a week in different places around the house and the only thing inside it is a hapless ladybug that wandered into it.  Hundreds of cluster flies cloud our windows and divebomb us as we walk from room to room.  A bug zapper has been the better approach for euthanizing these annoying insects."
1.0,Shipping is a problem,I would like to give this a better review but all 12 cans were badly dented to a point that I never would have purchased from a store. The case came inside another box so I don't think it was Amazons fault. Disappointing.
1.0,Waste of time and money,Bought the bottles less than a month ago.  Totally Tasteless...odorless...useless.  First time I used it and found it a waste of time in my coconut cream pie.  For crying out loud...it doesn't even SMELL like coconut.  Sorry I purchased it.
5.0,Best of the K-cups,"I'll keep this short and simple. These are the best K-cups I've had, and I've had a lot of them. Also makes the kitchen/office smell awesome. Well worth at least trying."
5.0,BEST. GUM. EVER.,This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time. Yummy!
5.0,The perfect nutrient and stylish aid for dry curly hair,"I got this oil for my daughter's hair, which is dry, long and curly. Well, she got it from me, but unlike me, she hates spending an hour blowdrying her hair to make it silky, something I'm sure will change once she hits puberty, but for now, she wears two braids, and her hair gets tangled frequently. The Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil, is perfect for our kind of hair, and after smelling it, I decided to try it on my own hair, and loved it.  The little bottle comes with a tip drop dispenser, which one can graduate depending of the amount of oil needed. I think it hints to the use of only a few drops at a time, so I recommend simply starting with three or five drops, rubbing hands together including fingertips, then massaging the scalp and hair with both hands until all the oil is absorbed by the hair, then stylish it. The smell lingers, but it's not overwhelming. The best effect of the oil is how well it nourishes the hair and scalp, which one can start to experience instantly, and confirmed after a few days of use. It also leaves the hair shiny and manageable. I'm  using it mostly during those days I don't want to stylish my hair and I wear a ponytail, or a single braid. This is one of the best hair products I encountered in a long time, a sure buy from now on."
1.0,Poor Selection,"I received my ""variety"" pack of teas today.  It contained:  7 Bigelow Pomegranate Green Teas 7 Celestial Seasonings Mandarin Spice Herbal Teas 6 Celestial Seasonings Sleepy Time Herbal Teas 2 Celestial Seasonings Decaf Green Teas 2 Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger Teas 1 Celestial Seasonings Green Tea 1 Twinings Green Tea 1 Twinings English Breakfast Tea 1 Twinings Earl Grey Tea 1 Celestial Seasonings India Spice Chai Tea 1 Cranberry Green Tea  I was highly disappointed that two favors comprised half of the order--not much of a variety if you ask me."
1.0,Soggy mess,"Okay I usually LOVE Fondarific fondant and order it any time I want to splurge and save myself the work of making my own fondant. Since I had a cake that I wanted to be hot pink I figured I would order some premade fondarific to avoid the hassle of trying to dye marshmellow fondant to the shade of pink I wanted. What a mess!! I started the cake late because I thought ""hey I have fondarific and it is a cinch to roll out"" WRONG. The stuff was a sticky, gooey mess that kept melting away and tearing when I tried to pull it off the rolling mat. I used a ton of shortening to keep it from sticking and rolled it super thick just to compensate. It sort of worked, my cake had pock marks in the fondant from where it started to tear and stick to the mat but at 1am I was more worried about getting the dang thing covered than I was about pock marks. Seriously it took me about 90 minutes to get my 2 tier cake covered where it usually would take 20 mins with fondarific. I don't know if it had to do with the pink dye in the fondant (I have never used this dark of a pink before) or if there was a manufacture defect with this batch of fondant. All I know is I live in Washington where there is zero humidity and you would have thought I was in Savannah Georgia with the way it was drooping off my hands. I will not be ordering this color again any time soon. I have 3 other colors I ordered and will try out soon, will let you know if I have the same problems with them."
5.0,We love this and the price is decent...,"I've read wonderful things about the benefits of this honey. Hopefully it's not a fad, health tip gone viral. We enjoy the taste. Very sweet and bold. You don't need much to go a long way. The price is decent, granted this type of honey is more expensive than most...but after doing some searching this price was fairly competitive compared to grocery store. We've re-order this because we were happy with it. We use it in our vegan protein shakes. Tasty :)"
5.0,Get more whole grains,"You can replace white flour in all your baking with this flour, and get more whole grains into your diet.  This flour does not make your baked goods heavy, and the flavor is very mild."
5.0,Childhood's memories right from a can,"This ""creme de marrons"" is exactly like I remembered. Good quality. Of course you have to know what you are buying. My children did not like it, but they had never had it before and this might be why. It goes well on crepes I think and there are lots of recipes out there to which you can add this little sweet paste."
1.0,Hernia Inducing Cat Litter,"I used Fresh Step cat litter for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that it was the best ""bang for the buck"" litter. It clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, it forms a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase this litter. Interestingly, after having this experience (twice, because I thought maybe I just got a bad batch the first time) I turned to Scoop Away which I always considered to be a similarly good product, only to find the exact same thing. What the heck? Turns out both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!"
1.0,Lame....,"If you want true flavor and big seeds, go get some Big's sunflower seeds.  Once you try Big's, you're not comm'n back to Davids."
5.0,Great rich roasted flavor,"Finding a rich roasted taste at an affordable price is hard to do ,but this coffee fills the ticket . I like my coffee strong and rich tasting with a roasted flavor and McDonald's coffee was the best That I could find . But McDonalds only sells it by the cup and they will not sell it otherwise so I started trying different brands and Yuban is the only coffee that comes close to McDonalds coffee. Try it ;you'll like it !!!"
5.0,"Totonac Maple Flavoring, 2-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)",Very good product flavors are robust and as expected.  Make sure you keep the cap on tight to prevent loss of quality.
1.0,Is This Really Indian Food?,"It looks like puke, off white and grainy and probably tastes similar, too. I can't find any peppers that I could recognize. It looks like yogurt based sauce that anyone can throw together blindfolded. It is very mild. It has no recognizable flavor of any Indian spice. Worst thing is that it is not returnable so I am stuck with it. I will never by this brand again."
5.0,Great diet soda substitue but expensive,Tastes great and seems to be more healthy than diet soda.  The only down side is the expense.  Have tried this flavor and the root beer (which is good as well).  If you use the subscribe and save feature this helps lower the price.
5.0,Yummy,I love the soft bakes oatmeal raisin cookies.  The subtle taste of the oatmeal with the natural sweetness of the raisins is wonderful.
5.0,Awesome Chips!!!!!!!!!!!,"I picked up a 3 oz bag of the Salt and Vinegar chips last weekend at Wegman's and in a blink of an eye, the bag was GONE.  Very nice vinegar flavor.  Bad side was in a blink of an eye they were gone which is not good for portion control.  I ordered the variety pack in .8 oz size (single serving) to help with portion control.  Most of the flavors I like - but fair warning, the parmesan garlic is VERY garlic. Love the salt and pepper.  With 100 calories a pack, what a nice change from baked chips.  Try it - you will like it."
5.0,Love Big Train Chai,"I love Chai tea, and Big Train Chai is the best one that I have come across. The 3lb. bag is the best buy! Knowing what I would have spent at a coffee shop...5 drinks alone would cost at least $20, so I've made my money back after only 5 or so drinks. A yummy product, big quantity and saved money~I Love it!!"
1.0,Do not sell this product,"This is product of very poor quality. Mushrooms have worms. This is clear when they are reoconsistuted with water. Basically, the mushrooms had not been checked before processing. This product should be taken from market I would put no star, but this is not an option"
5.0,"Best snack out there, but buy elsewhere!",We love Ella's! Amazingly pure and delicious portable snack. But this price is crazy - it is cheaper at our Whole Foods in Manhattan! Eek!
1.0,No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts,"My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis. It isn't. Read the Nutrition Facts (per 3 cookies): 160 Calories, 11 Grams of Fat, 3 Grams of Saturated Fat, 18 Grams of Carbohydrate....the same, or worse, than most cookies containing sugar. These cookies may be ""sugar free"", but the implied health benefit is completely imaginary. Furthermore, at over 50 cents per ounce they are the most expensive packaged grocery cookies you can buy, which is completely unjustified by ingredient cost, and flavor, which is adequate but not exceptional.  It's an unfortunate fact that some companies prey upon consumers who seek or need ""special"" products by forcing them to pay huge premiums for the product. Using Murray's formula, a can of Diet Coke should cost at least $3....but it doesn't, simply because production costs do not justify the premium and the market will not tolerate such an unconscionable mark-up. Neither should you. Don't let your health or dietary concerns override your common sense and lead you to pay preposterously inflated prices for ""special"" products that, upon close inspection, provide no legitimate benefit."
5.0,Great stuff,"Love this product, been using it for 13 years and will continue because there is nothing that compares to it's taste and quality!"
1.0,A ripoff,"The salsa is incredible, but not for this price. One can order the same salsa from El Fenix's website for $29.50... less than HALF of the price offered here."
5.0,GREAT TASTE AND VALUE,Lima beans are always a good dish but these are excellent with the bacon flavor. After taking some Bean Zime I will sit down by the TV and eat a whole can they are so good. And good for you too BTW.
1.0,Bland and Boring,"This coffee was boring to bland, which was very disappointing since I had had what I believed to be some delicious Douwe Egberts coffee at a local diner. Clearly, this was not the same stuff. Just tasted like week coffee."
1.0,WHAT?,"Not sure why Amazon put these under natural, but NATURAL these are NOT! I am one of those lucky people that are allergic to some of the FD&C dyes so be warned....these are chalked full~"
5.0,not mixed,Their is no mix that I could see. It did come up so that is a plus and the cats ate it well. Not what they advertized
1.0,Syrup????,For syrup it is awfully runny. More like flavored water. I've had much better from other companies. I won't buy this again. Sorry I bought two bottles the first time.
5.0,Awesome Rice,This rice is amazing. High in Protein and Fiber. It has a nutty taste and is very filling. My whole family loves it so much we buy it by the case since it is really hard to find in stores.
5.0,It takes like Eggos.,"If you like Blueberry Eggo Waffles, and you like flavored coffee, you will like this.  The flavor is especially awesome with blueberry or vanilla creamer."
5.0,The Best,"I have been enjoying ""Deadmans Reach"" for close to 15 years now.. This is by FAR  - THE BEST coffee ever, if you like to be ""Hyper Caffeinate"" !! RavensBrew is a great company to do business with as well -"
5.0,"Nutricious, tasty, low cal","This is another very good soup from Progresso. For those used to Campbell's Cream of Tomato soup, this is a big change. The soup is spicier, and there are chunks of tomatoes in it. Its not quite as creamy as the Campbell's made with milk, but it is rather thick.  Calories are in a good range at 130 per serving, and a bowl of this soup is filling. There is a ""regular"" variety of this soup without the high fiber content that is fewer calories still, but I like this one as I have trouble getting enough fiber in my diet daily. This soup will go well with a sandwich and still have a lunch that doesn't threaten the waistline.  Recommended."
5.0,Best Gluten Free Pancakes Ever!,"If you have tried and tried to find a replacement for gluten free baked goods, specifically Pancakes/Waffles/Chocolate Chip cookies.....look no further!  Pamela's is amazing!  Your guests will probably not even know you made gluten free."
5.0,Songbird Essentials Seed Hoop,"This is a great product. New to feeding birds from a hanging feeder on our patio, we were surprised and frustrated by the mess our new friends made (disgarded seeds everywhere). The 30"" Seedhoop has effectively corrected the problem.  You do need to be patient after first attaching to your feeder as it takes a few days for the birds to realize they can feast without harm."
1.0,pieces too big,"I believed that I was ordering small pieces which I could use in baking or cream cheese and ginger sandwiches.  The pieces are much too big for this purpose and they are not really crystallized ginger, they are soggy cubes of sugar coated junk.  Short on flavor and unpleasant texture."
1.0,"Seriously, this is pretty bad","Ok. So all I wanted was a simple way to get some good for you pineapple without the mess. The answer... Canned Pineapple, right? I of course opted for Organic, because hey, at least it's better then boring ol' Dole. Boy was I disappointed. Ok, first let's talk color. The color pictured on the can's label shows pineapple that is bright yellow and vibrant. Alas, the pineapple in the can was more of n off brown see through, mutated something or other. Not yellow at all. Not bright and vibrant at all. Now let's talk taste, because even if the color was off (by a lot!) at least it still tasted good, right...? Wrong! This tasted like cheap imitation pineapple that airlines wouldn't even serve back when they served meals. I gagged at almost each bite hoping the next one would be better. These stale with almost no flavor. My Advice... buy the real stuff and slice it up or buy it already sliced. Nothing... and I do mean nothing beats the real thing. And the fact that this can says organic, don't let it fool you, it tastes awful..."
5.0,Wow! Amazing shipping time!,"These beans are awesome! First time buyer, but not the last! :-) I will definitely buy from again. My dad and I ordered these after paying over $4 per shriveled little bean in the grocery store. I never knew vanilla beans were supposed to be so plump and ""juicy"". Wow, these are amazing! They smell divine! Packaged wonderfully, but you can still smell the yumminess packed inside. :-D Highly recommend! As a bonus, the estimated delivery date was Sept 16. I got them today, Sept 11! Woot! :-)"
1.0,WAY Overpriced!!,"This company is gouging you people!!  The product itself is fabulous, the best Chai Latte ever!  But I just bought 6 16-count boxes (what this actually is) from Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10.99 each.  Unfortunately it looks like they've stopped making this so the mark up is just going to get worse.  Shame on you."
1.0,"Beware:  Terrible taste, possible side effects, buy at your risk","I've had very good luck with some of the teas sold by Amazon (for example, Good Earth and Triple Leaf brands), but not with this product.  Contains four different types of teas specifically formulated to combat the sniffles.  Breathe Deep:  Tastes like jasmine incense (though licorice root and eucalyptus leaf are the top ingredients) with an unpleasant lingering aftertaste.  Cold Season:  Very powerful smell, taste, and aftertaste.  Ginger root and licorice root are the top two ingredients.  Throat Comfort:  Licorice root and fennel seed the top ingredients.  Can really taste the fennel and soothing to the throat but gave me stomach upset and a headache.  Echinacea Immune Support:  Peppermint leaf and lemongrass are the top two ingredients (note that peppermint is not recommended for those with GERD).  Echinacea root is the third ingredient. Can taste the top two ingredients.  It is not an unpleasant tea, but does have an odd aftertaste.  There is a pattern here:  Licorice root is prominent in these teas' formulations.  Buy at your risk:  They cannot be returned under Amazon's grocery policy, though Amazon did kindly refund my money after complaining.  Yoga does not have a customer satisfaction statement on the box, so don't know how the company would handle customer dissatisfaction."
1.0,Dog will not touch it,"My 1 year-old Golden Retriever shows no interest in this bone.  He loves Kongs, Greenies, rawhide, and other bones, but will not touch these.  He sniffs it for a second, gives me a funny look, sort of like ""Where's the beef"", then pouts."
5.0,At the top,"The big Amazon box arrived in the mail today.  Wow, four BIG tins of Curry powder.  I was cooking within 30 minutes of it arriving and it was DELICIOUS!  I'm not a conniseur by any stretch of the imagination, but it made for one of the best curries I ever tasted.  Three friends will be receiving Madras Curry powder tomorrow.  16 ounce cans are large.  Spice money well spent."
1.0,lame,These are lame.  They all taste the same. Gelatin is made from animal skin and connective tissue that has been chemically processed into oblivion with extremely powerful chemicals.
5.0,LOVE IT!,"We love our WowButter!!!  I has the same consistency as regular peanut butter & the same taste!!  Doesn't get hard with age, not too sweet, and could fool anyone into believing it's really peanut butter.  It's a staple we have to have for my son."
1.0,Great Candy Awful Seller,"My daughter loves these candies.  They used to sell them in Wal-mart, but they no longer carry them so for Christmas I went online to see if I could buy them outright from a candy distributor.  When they arrived the bag wasn't sealed and one of the candies fell out when I lifted up the bag.  When I poured them into a tin to wrap for Christmas I noticed some of the candies had blue dots on them and some of them looked ""dirty""!?!  I tried contacting the seller but have not received a reply back.  VERY Disappointed.  I've never had a problem with Amazon before.  What a bummer"
1.0,healthy but bad tasting to me,"This product is healthy since it contains no hydrogenated oils but gosh darn the taste is awful. it is sour and salty taste and I cannot grow accustom to eating it. Unfortunately too, this tortilla wrap is the only one with 100% no trans fat, every other store brand contains hydrogenated which means there is some trans fat."
1.0,KTC  Mustard Oil  is not edible,"Upon receiving the KTC mustard oil, we noticed that the label said for external use only.  As the product was listed with other ""gourmet food items"" we had assumed that this was a mustard flavored food oil.  Not a mustard Seed oil.  There is a big difference and one that could be dangerous if not noted.  The Amazon ad did not relate any warnings or ingredient list that I could find, that would have helped me avoid purchasing the wrong item."
5.0,Best of the best!,"I had searched far and wide for this scotch bonnet pepper sauce nearby where I live...but it just seems that the midwest doesn't crave this particular flavor.  I fell in love with this stuff in the Caymen Islands and finally found it through Amazon.  It's a fabulous flavor-- mixing the 'zing' with a bit of unique sweetness.  Unbelievable on most everything...meat (pulled pork, hamburgers etc.),pizza, soups (especially chili), with snacks and appetizers (like hummas), and in pasta (my favorite....mac n cheese for a nice variation).  I bought three bottles this time, to make sure I have enough to last for a while.  One thing to be aware of is the thick texture.  I added about an once of filtered water to bring it to a more desirable consistency for myself, after having used a small portion...I just added the water and shook it up.  To me, this sauce is not just HOT like some of the others out there that have no flavor attached to the heat, instead, it just has a fabulous, dynamic flavor that I simply can't get enough of.  At less than four dollars a bottle...you CANNOT pass this JCS scotch bonnet sauce up!"
5.0,Best salami I've had,"This salami is my favorite, but I can't find it in local stores except in small 6-oz pre-sliced packages. Excellent, mild flavor and perfect texture. I bought an electric meat slicer just for this salami. I'm really looking forward to it being available on Amazon."
1.0,This stuff is awful,"I really like cereal and eat a lot of it.  The sweet cereals are a treat I give myself from time to time.  Saw Krave and it sounded interesting, had a coupon and it was on sale so decided to take a chance.  Tried the chocolate flavor (instead of double chocolate) first as it sounded like it was going to be very sweet.  Not even close.  The texture is overall soft, like it's barely staying together.  The center is gooey.  The taste is an odd one (the words ""chocolate"" and ""sweet"" don't come to mind) and there is a strong chemical aftertaste, so much so that I found myself reading the ingredients list to try and understand why.  Had another coupon and it was still on sale, decided to try the double chocolate to see if maybe that's better.  Same overall results.  Both flavors of this cereal are just plain nasty.  How can you possibly ruin a chocolate flavored cereal???  I'm amazed it made it though the taste tests at Kellogg's to be released to the public."
1.0,Horrible and misleading,"This ""sugarless"" product has more calories than regular sugar.  It has fructose syrup in it, which they use instead of sugar.  It also has food coloring in it, that is banned in most European states, like Germany.  The rest of it is Gelatin, which is made out of grind up bones.  Further the product made in Austria, arrived wet and smelly.  Terrible.  This is a very misleading product, chances are it is cancer causing and definetely bad for your teeth, diet or moods."
5.0,Good Stuff,"I cook alot and use lot of herbs, spices and pepper. This is a great value and has tons of flava!!!  Don't hesitate to purchase."
1.0,Reese Skinless and Boneless sardines,"I bought these for my Mom who likes Sardines. She said that they terrible. Unfortunately, they will be discarded, because she lives in another city and is unable to return them. I just wasted my money, when I am trying to help my Mom with her food cost."
1.0,Less than appealing,"I know this product is supposed to be good for you considering the fiber content, but I just could not choke it down. Not appealing to me at all."
5.0,"Tastes great, no sodium benzoate, just perks me up","Don't know why Hansen's isn't promoting this drink more. It's hard to find. There was only one store that had it in my area and they stopped carrying it. So I had to buy 3 cases from Amazon.  It tastes like Mountain Dew, has the right ingredients. Yeah, there's sugar but no high fructose corn syrup. Gives a nice lift in the morning without a crash later. I drink it instead of coffee."
1.0,Cat food MADE IN THAILAND,"If I had known this cat food was manufactured in Thailand I would not have ordered it. I can't imagine there's much oversight of pet food production there. There is no mention of Thailand in Amazon's description, but it's stamped in big red letters on the box. I fed one can without knowing - it made my cat sick and there were whole fish vertebra in the vomit."
5.0,perfect for kids (and adults) on a sugar-free diet,"We really enjoy these.  Those expecting the taste of the artificial pops may be disappointed, but if you just wish you can have a freeze pop like your sugar-eating friends -- then, you will be quite satisfied! We just wish that A. the manufacturer would make them larger and B. Amazon would carry them, at a decent price!!!!!!!"
5.0,real good value and great jerky,"i really liked this product and is made in good ole USA ....good stuff and right price (was 12.99) ...""very nice "" will buy again"
1.0,Worst Coconut Milk Ever!,"This is the worst coconut milk ever. My wife is Thai and we had used this brand before and appreciated that it was organic and BPA free cans. However, now its made in Sri Lanka and the quality of the coconut milk is unacceptable. The packaging is completely misleading as the product looks nothing like the image on the label. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. I now have 11 cans of inedible coconut milk."
1.0,Don't get ripped off,"I've seen these products at high-end pet stores.  Don't get ripped off.  This is a total waste of money if you live in a town with at least one Asian grocery store. Go to your Asian grocery, preferably Japanese, and purchase dried bonito flakes, i.e. katsuobushi.  Katsuobushi is way cheaper and probably much better quality, as it's meant for human consumption.  There should only be one ingredient.  Bonito.  One of the ingredients we Japanese use to make dashi stock."
5.0,Best Herbal Equivalent I found to Earl Grey Tea!,"Please keep in mind that Earl Grey (my all time favorite), has a strong Bergamot (citrus) flavor and that's the reason this Lemon Ginger is pretty much the only herbal tea I like.  I drink A LOT of tea during the day, mostly black (not so good, I know).  Over the years I have tried different varieties (black 'straight up' or 'decaffeinated', green, red, white and herbal teas) and ALWAYS come back to 'straight' black Earl Grey. As healthy as the red or herbal teas might be, I simply do not really care for the taste of most of them.  This Lemon Ginger is the only one that I keep a boxful of on hand and brew it often in the evening (when drinking caffeine before the bed would not be such a bright idea). Taste-wise, it is the closest to the Earl Grey without caffeine, that I found."
1.0,Rip off,"this was a rip off.  Girl Scout cookies cost $3.50 per box from Girl Scouts.  I thought there would be more than one box in the package for the price I paid, more than twice as much.  In addition, many of the cookies were either partially crumbled or stuck together."
1.0,Same Gastro Problems,"Really recommend that buyers beware - I too ate no more than a handful of this product - about 2.5 hours later, I had minor stomach pains - another hour after that, I was in umimaginable pain.  It took a good 3 hours of severe pain and bathroom trips to be able to walk upright or consider any other behavior.  Twenty-four hours later, I was still not 100%.  Buy the full sugar version in little bags and learn moderation - the sugar-free version is NOT a good answer"
1.0,"Dry, dehydrated and stale.","I'm not sure if I just got an old batch or what, but they were really dry. The powdered suger was clumpy too. I was looking to having these turkish delights but they just suck. I guess I'll just have to find some local here."
5.0,Great on Large Orders (for cheaper shipping),"These Peanut Butter chips are fantastic. We use them in all sorts of cookies and candy making too. To melt them (which not using as chips), use a double boiler and they melt like magic.  These babies go great with the carob (chocolate alternative) chips: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CXUE0?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8  As well as the yogurt coating (both sold by Barry Farm): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVTE0?tag=a52-20&ie=UTF8  Do note: the more you order from Barry Farm, the better the shipping (compared to all items), but larger orders can take a little longer to ship. Don't fret though, you'll get it!"
1.0,Bumble pink salmon boney,"If you like Pink Salmon, I would not recommend Bumble Bee Pink Salmon in a can. It has little skelton bones that look like small vertebraes.When I contacted Bumble Bee about the problem. They did not respond, leaving me to believe that they don't care what people think of their products or don't care if there are problems with them. They get a 0 rating from me and I will never buy another Bumble Bee product."
5.0,So Good!,"I tried this for the first time and I loved it! It is so good! This product is so much better then Chef Boyardee's Ravioli. You really get a lot per can. The sauce is rich, the ravioli is meaty and tender. 3 minutes in the microwave and you have a meal or snack that is filling and satisfying. Plus the price from Amazon is great. I highly recommend Campbell's Raviolios. Enjoy!"
1.0,Weak,"Coffee is more like cold colored water than coffee!!  Wanted some strong coffee, very disappointed, wish I Had not ordered so much, was trying to save money, but feel like I got ripped off big time!!"
1.0,Stale flavored chorizo.,I was expecting to be a lot of flavor from this Spanish chorizo. It is too bland to compliment my dish. Perhaps because it is too dry and appears stale. Not worth your dollar.
1.0,Seriously?,"When I purchased this item the webpage claimed you got 12 JARS for this price, original price of $100.  Thought it was some cool closeout or something.  Instead got 1 jar, which makes this overpriced, not to mention false advertising."
5.0,Amazing colors!,"Love, love, love these food dyes!  Great assortment of colors that made my Easter cookies pop!  A little bit goes a loooooong way with these dyes.  I think these will last me a very long time.  I used these to color icing for cookies and the color was absolutely gorgeous....we received many compliments on our cookies."
1.0,*gag*,"I wasn't expecting much from a Taco Bell product, but I was at least expecting something edible, with a little heat, that I could offer as a sauce for tacos.  A pretty low bar, right?  But this 'Jalapeno' Sauce doesn't even meet that criteria.  First of all: ""Bold & Creamy""?  I guess it's creamy, in a gag-inducing way, but there is no bold there.  Perhaps someone passed a jalapeno over the bottle as a flavoring. Maybe.  There is no heat, no kick at all.  Which would be fine; some people don't like kick.  Except they named it Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce.  So....yeah.  Even if you accept that this is a mild sauce, it's still gross.  There is buttermilk in it, which gives it a tang, but soybean oil & water are the first two ingredients (of more than 25).  The whole thing just tastes really chemical-y and fake and bad.  BOTTOM LINE:  I have teenage boys.  Who run cross country.  They're hungry at dinnertime, and not what you'd call discerning.  And even they wouldn't eat this stuff."
1.0,Truly revolting,"Imagine farmers on earth lose the ability to grow peanuts. And, 10000 years down the road, an alien species who never tasted peanut butter before tries to whip up a batch. I am sure the result would be something like Walden Farms Peanut Spread.  It's not very peanuty, not very buttery...it's just the vaguest notion of peanut taste in a very foul paste-like consistency. The after taste is thoroughly horrible, with notes of shredded hubcaps and melted imitation Reeboks from Laos.  If you are a dieter and are trying to incorporate some fun alternatives into your eating plan, skip this one. It's truly revolting."
5.0,Very Good,I sometimes have a hard time finding these in the store. So when I found these online I was very happy. Me and My daughter loves them.
5.0,Great for when you are sick or to help your immune system!,"Love this product!  All the flavors in the sampler come in handy.  I got everyone at my office addicted to these teas and we were ordering them by the case.  I have a few friends who refuse to drink hot tea, but once they tried these they fell in love and said it was the only hot tea they liked!  No honey or sweetner needed, they are perfect the way they are!"
1.0,"If I could give it negative stars, I would!","I was very excited about this product, then I recieved it! It tastes like metalic/ plastic. It's a weird taste very hard to describe. It smells just as bad as it tastes. I'm upset and amazon said No Returns! I have contacted the manufacturer and am waiting to hear back. I hope I didn't just throw money in the garbage which is exactly where this product is going if they don't take it back."
1.0,Wholly Crap. Literally...,"Picked up a bag @ Target the other night on a lurch, as I didn't want to trek to my regular local supplier at 6:30am the next morning. Packaging was appealing enough to give it a try, and that's about where it ends. This is probably some of the worst coffee I've ever bought. It's like SB's, but flavorless and only about half as burnt-tasting. I would opt for the instant KIA packs next time I find myself in this predicament!!"
5.0,Brilliant- best decaf on the market!,"I would just perish without PG Tips decaf! I'm off of caffeine, (grumble) and find that no other decaf tea seems to have the flavor of caffeinated tea. Thankfully, this product DOES. It tastes like regular tea- even better, actually! Quite smooth, rich and full bodied. They must never cease to make it! Puts all other decaf black teas to shame. Very pleased to find it on line, as no one near me carries the decaf any longer. Since I can no longer have my beloved PG Tips regular, this is the perfect substitute! Now if I could only wake up....oh, caffeine, right...oh well...at least I've got a cuppa."
5.0,Best baby food ever!,"My 6 month old baby absolutely loves this food, he smacks his slips every time I give it to him. Its so quick and easy to prepare I mix it with oatmeal or cereal and milk. Only downside is each package makes 2.5 oz, and its a bit pricey for me. But the quality of the food is superb! Its worth every penny! I don't use this daily since I make him his food, but this is a great substitute for on the go or last minute quick fix."
5.0,Like A Marathon Bar From My Childhood,This brought back memories of my childhood and the old Marathon candy bars I used to get as a kid. These actually taste better!
1.0,Not the item pictured,"I ordered this item specifically because it is the new packaging.  I received the old packaging, which also does not taste like the one that is pictured.  I sent a message to Amazon and have not heard a response.  I am curious as if I should just dispute the charge being as I do not have the option of returning it?"
5.0,Need a shot?,"Love these... I drink espresso every day, and when I need an extra shot at work this is great"
5.0,Satisfied.,"The chilies come in small cans and are perfect for me, a single woman.  Also, it is so hard to get whole chilies in the town I live in.  Thank you."
1.0,Nobody likes it,"One reviewer said it was not medium brew and it doesn't taste like medium brew - at all.  I had ordered their decaf and it is amazing!  I made one for my sister and she said it sure didn't taste like decaf...and she's an orthodox coffer drinker.  So she came up after I recieved this 50-50 just for her and she said it was really weak. She made another cup and put another pod in with the first one and used less water - and it was still weak! She came up after that and made this coffee, dumped it out and said she was going to use my decaf and don't order anymore of this crap - and that girl wouldn't EVEN drink decaf before.  So for us - cancel that subscribe and save and stick with the decaf.  Seriously, this is not even close to medium roast!"
1.0,Gigantic rip-off !!,Price for the bucket is only $ 18 at Sam's !!! So they overcharge you by 400 %.You should not buy at that company.
1.0,Just Awful,"This product has a terrible metallic after taste. No matter how I try to doctor it up, with extra sweeteners, flavored creamers, etc., the just awrful metallic taste comes through. The surprising thing, is, however, that the decaf version of this same product tastes much better."
5.0,So good you need to put them in the trunk on the way home from the store if you don't want to sneak into the box,"The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are delicious, I received a complimentary sample from Influencers to try the product and review it.  Well when the Vox Box that contained my complimentary products to try I opened it up infront of the mailbox, on the way up my driveway I ate my cookie.  I absolutely love that these are individually packaged yet a nice size cookie.  You don't feel deprived by throwing just one in your lunch box or purse, and certainly the kids love them.  I think they are very reasonably priced, and plan to stock up on a few boxes.  Perfect for the the beach when you want snacks yet don't want the seagulls attacking open food bags.  Not to mention they are a guilt free snack:  -Made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats -Individually packaged -Provides a good source of fiber -Contains 6 grams of total fat per serving  Definite buy, if on sale stock up."
5.0,K Kups,All of the K cups I have recerived are excellent.  I love my Keurig and would recommend it to everyone.
1.0,Not Usable - looks like they were roasted and had a strong chemical smell,"We have been buying the decaf sumatra unroasted beans from Coffee Direct for a few months now. Although the beans looked a bit different than the Sumatra we had been buying from Sweet Marias, they roasted and tasted fine. But I'm afraid that on the last order we had the same experience as ""Thomas A. Oehser "" , not once but twice. Received beans that appeared to have already been roasted except they had a bad strong chemical smell. Contacted Amazon's great customer service department and they immediately sent a replacement order via 1 day shipping. Received the replacement beans today but they had the exact same problem. Unusable. Contacted Amazon customer service and they immediately refunded our full purchase price plus shipping. We thern cancelled our subscription to Coffee Bean Direct for future orders. Apparently Coffee Bean Direct has significant quality control problems."
1.0,Cheap K-CUP clogs my Keurig!,"I bought these the other day because they seemed a good deal and also had many different flavors. I used the first one and the Keurig seemed to drip out instead of flow. I tried to use a regular K-Cup that I had and it worked fine. I tried this with over 10 of The Brooklyn K-Cups, I am completely dissatisified, and wish I could rate this lower than a 1. I would never buy another one of their products!!"
5.0,My dog loves this food,"My Miniature Schnauzer was having lots of health issues and had ""Schnauzer Bumps"", but we didn't know what was wrong with her. After doing research online, we decided to try her on a grain-free diet and she is doing great now. Before her skin was hot, dry, itchy and covered with bumps. Now she feels good, looks good and her skin is clear and smooth. Thank you Taste of the Wild. My only wish is that you would offer some treats. But to solve that problem, we buy two flavors of the food and fill her  bowl with one flavor and give the other one to her for a treat. And since they taste different, she is happy and so are we. We buy the Salmon and the Fowl flavors and alternate them as her food and treats periodically. Just a note, the other thing that we did for our dog was to also change her shampoo to the Nootie brand of Aloe and Oatmeal Shampoo in Cucumber and Melon fragrance (sold by Amazon also). It's natural, works and smells great and even our groomer buys it to use and says that our dog's skin has improved 100%."
5.0,good stuff,"no calories tastes like the real thing, works great with stevia, a a a a a a a a a a a a a"
1.0,Yuck!,"These didn't taste at all like the freeze dried bananas I get at the grocery store. I am a little confused, because both brands list bananas as the only ingredient (no sweeteners, salt or flavorings added).  These taste terrible.  They do not have any banana flavor and there is no natural sweetness to them at all.  I cannot eat them straight from the bag, so I have tried mixing them in with granola and into muffins, but they just taste like a bland, tasteless chip.  I tried giving them to my puppies as treats, and they wouldn't touch them.  What a disappointment. I don't know how you can mess up a product with only one ingredient."
1.0,Horrible!!!,"I expected the product to be something entirely different from what I received. The minute I opened the seal to see what it looked like, the smell slapped me dead in my face. The smell was so bad that I ran to wash my hands and I refused to put that in my hair or on my skin. It melted into basically water, as for that part maybe that was expected to happen because it's an oil. On the other hand, the smell I doubt was supposed to be that potent and bad. I will be throwing it away because I cannot use it or give it away to anyone."
1.0,The cereal is stale,"I baught this kind of cereal from Wholefood. Since this was the first time I tried this brand, I picked 3 kinds: multi-grain, oatmeal and brown rice. Oatmeal was all right, but the other two smelled like they were already stale(the expiration day is May 2013), and they tasted bad too and sticked on my throat when I tried them. My baby cried and refused to eat them. The customer service of Wholefood was very nice and refunded me. I don't think I will buy this brand of cereal again."
1.0,Disappointing 'milker',"We have switched to organic, natural foods and have tried to eliminate hydrogenated oils from our diet - that meant finding a replacement for Creamora. I was excited to find this product. Sadly the taste does not live up to the name. Instead of Creamer it should be called Milker. There is no creamy taste, frankly it is the equivalent of adding non-fat dry milk to your morning coffee. True, no hydrogenated oils, but also no cream, so what is the point? They need to do a version that is not non-fat, using real cream. Oh well, live and learn. I'm still using it by mixing it with Creamora until I can find a true replacement. Will not be a repurchase."
5.0,soba noodles,"buying a case of 12 12oz pkgs with free shipping made these noodles a great deal, much less than buying at the whole foods store."
5.0,Delicious Flavor - Better than sugary Root Beer,"Zevia drinks have been my favorite alternative to sugary or diet drinks. I like all the flavors I've tried but I really loved the Root Beer flavor. It reminds me of when I was a kid and enjoyed root beer floats. This is however a more complex drink with the natural flavors of wintergreen oil, anise oil, lemon oil, orange oil and ginger extract. This does contain citric acid which can cause tooth damage if you drink it too often. I think it is safe to say that this drink won't harm you if you only drink it now and then. My little Eat Safe handbook also says that Erythritol is safe at low levels. When you think of the dangers of eating too much sugar or artificial sweeteners then this drink starts to look pretty darn good. But drink in moderation. The problem with the ginger root beer flavor is that you will want two cans at a time. It really is that good.  ~The Rebecca Review"
5.0,THE best creamer,"I have to have my coffee every day, and I have tried many different kinds of flavored creamers.  This is the best, hands down.  I keep one at home and one at work.  It adds the perfect amount of creaminess and sweetness, but it still tastes like coffee.  I wish it was more readily available.  I've seen it for sale at other places (Sam's Club, for example), but Amazon definitely has the best price.  I highly recommend it for all coffee drinkers."
1.0,Coconut Water,"The taste was just awful.  I tried to choke this down after a long workout but it wasn't worth the effort.  I will not give it away. I will throw it away. However, Amazon refunding my money was great."
1.0,Poor quality and taste,"I got this at the same time I got Davidson's Assam tea. While I love the Assam and would recommend it, I cannot say the same for this Earl Grey. There is a lemony citrus taste, not the smooth Bergamot flavor I am used to in a good Earl Grey. It is way too bitter because of this. I wish I could like it a bit more as the price was great, but nothing is good about the price when you cannot enjoy the product at any level."
5.0,Great every day coffee,"I've always enjoyed Eight O'Clock coffee and this did not disappoint.  I drink this coffee pretty much everyday and brew it using a standard drip style single funnel with filter.  Even when fairly finely ground, the coffee is still smooth and easy to drink without being bitter.  I will definitely be ordering more of this."
5.0,Great nutrition and great taste,"This is a great snack for my little guy. It's wonderful nutrition with a yummy taste, very good combination. Makes a great snack."
5.0,"Oh, this is good!!!","I've never tried this brand of chocolate before. I prefer semi-sweet so this was a real treat to be able to try it out. Everyone's taste is a little different so let me describe the flavor as very close to Nestle's Semi-sweet morsels used in chocolate chip cookies. Scharffen Berger is just a little bit sweeter (not quite the sour bite I'm used to).  I did not taste the honey but I did have an aftertaste of citrus. Its hard to describe. Its like if you eat a fresh ripe strawberry, after a few chews you get a little twang after you notice the sweetness.  Good chocolate is expensive so I think the price is reasonable at around $3 per 3 ounce bar. Although there is a cross-cut design on the top, it does not help if you want to make specific sized pieces."
5.0,Delicious,I've been through 3 cases of this product and plan to continue to purchase it.  The quality is great and I've had no issues with ordering from this company.
5.0,BEST ESPRESSO,"Medaglia D' Oro is the BEST espresso out there!  It is cost effective, excellent taste, better than any of the others, and convenient.  Easier than fixing my espresso ground beans and just as good. Tom"
1.0,Chalky Sugar,"The switch to organic is a good step, but Rice Dream rice milk is chalky and too sugary - 23 grams of carbohydrates per serving!  That's close to the sugars in a soda.  A person could get a sugar high or go into sugar shock (if diabetic) with this level of sugar.  I finally stumbled upon unsweetened Almond Breeze vanilla which has 4 grams of carbs and So Delicious vanilla coconut milk which has 9 grams of carbs.  I still have half a dozen sugary rice milks that I'm watering down with homemade almond milk just to reduce the terrifying sugar level.  Unsweetened Almond Breeze tastes smooth and nutty, and regular so Delicious both tastes smooth and somewhat coconutty.  You can even mix the two and even add some rice milk, but rice milk alone is too high in sugars."
5.0,lovely flowers,"I had only used chamomile from store bought tea bags, so this was a new way to purchase for me. 16 oz of dried herb, is a lot of dried herb, it filled a gallon ziplock bag. They were fragrant, with heads mostly in tact and not a lot of stem. I would say when steeped they were easily twice as flavorful as anything I was used to. Better quality, better price (by a lot), I will never buy spices at the grocery store again. Thanks Amazon."
5.0,Great Disposable K-cups,"Tried the  disposable k-cups and they work great, just as good as keurig k-cups. Put my own mid grind coffee in cups and they worked without problems. They couldn't be any easier to use. Will continue to use them."
1.0,To be perfectly honest...,"This is by far the worst hot chocolate I've ever had and trust me, I'm a chocolate lover...  The taste is too artificial, it's not creamy, it leaves a bad after taste, and it fills only half of a cup. Now I assume the half a cup is so we can pour milk after but if it's already horribly ruined, why bother?  The Tassimo machine is great besides their choice of certain products to compliment it, like this. Nastyyy..."
1.0,Hatcho Miso or not Hatcho miso,"Hatcho miso is made in Okazaki a town in Aichi prefecture in Japan, that's about 250 miles from Sendai for the over- excited. It is the most famous miso in Japan. Warlord Tokugawa (Richard Chamberlains 15th Century Shogun buddy) was it's most famous advocate. He drank Hatcho miso soup everyday. Japan's current Emperor is also a ""customer"" The only authentic Hatcho is exported by Mitoku company. Eden foods are listed by Mitoku as an importer of authentic Hatcho. However, this web page proclaims in a couple of places that the product being sold is made from 100% American soybeans!  It has a very earthy flavor. Salt content is fairly high, but, one doesn't eat a sufficiently large quantity to be much of a problem unless one has real health problems with any amount of excess salt. Personally, I believe the benefits from eating miso products far outway the possible detriments.  The price being asked is high for genuine Hatcho miso and ridiculously high if the product is in fact American made.  Eden/Amazon need to clarify.  Caveat Emptor."
5.0,The BEST chocolates out there!!,I LOVE the Mauna Loa chocolate covered macadamia nuts!! they are simply the best! I also love the Mauna Loa chocolate covered macadamia nuts WITH coconut!! yum! the quality is great..they are very large and nuts always seem very fresh..and the chocolate itself is very good. These are a MUST try!!
1.0,Poor product,"This is  terrible popcorn! No taste, poor popping ratio. and the size OMG! I popped this Gourmet popping corn in front of a party, everyone busted out in laughter!"
5.0,amazing...,"Manna is an appropriate way to describe this beautiful, pure and divine concoction, made purely and simply from coconut ""meat."" It literally melts in your mouth. It comes as a solid in the container. You just have to place it in hot water for ten minutes, then stir it. This can be used as a spread or for anything, really."
1.0,Read before using this Fish Scaler!,"I got this in a large pack of Dove body wash at a big name bulk store and was excited to try it out.  I normally use the pouf to shower with (Don't tell my Pals!), but decided to give this a go.  It's, as another person posted, ""Like using a Brillo Pad!"".  I have very sensitive skin so it's way too rough for me.  It's too small, gets very slick, and it's impossible to reach in between the Guy parts.  I don't see how any Man could ever use this other than for scrubbing dirty, greasy hands.  It's made more for the mechanic or coal miner who needs to scrub their skin to get clean and definitely not for a Guy who occasionally does some yard work, etc.  If you arrive home looking like Mike Rowe after a hard day at ""Dirty Jobs"" then this may just be for you!"
5.0,Num num bacon num num,"I bought these bones for my adult dog and a couple of young teething puppies I was fostering.  My adult dog was able to devour these things in no time (I eventually got him the larger sized bones so it would at least last him a good minute instead of seconds).  The puppies loved to chew on these things and were determined to eat them as fast as they could.  When one puppy managed to finish, she would go after her sister's if she still had some left.  These things actually smell good enough that you might almost want to eat one.  haha  They don't last too long but they are a good treat for a dog, especially one who is teething.  They still don't last more than 5 minutes but if you want to spoil your dog, this is a good way to do it."
1.0,caused my dogs to have allergies,"both of my dogs got allergies from these bully sticks. Both dogs are itching like crazy, first started with the shaking of the ear then scratching all over. Took them to the vets and finally got it narrowed down to these. Not good at all."
1.0,Terrible!,This was hands down the worst coffee I've ever had.  I bought it because Amazon had it on sale for a fantastic price...little did I know that it was going to be so bad that no one in my office could drink it.  This coffee is a waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone.
1.0,Never fix something that isn't broken...including candy!,"I've been eating 3 Musketeer bars for over 55 years and though they have never been my favorite, they were certainly delectable.  No more!  The new ""formula"" has eradicated the malt nougat and replaced it with ""more chocolate.""  Quite honestly, it tastes more like a bad Tootsie roll than a Musketeers.  Too bad Mars has lousy corporate judgement...I mean, do we REALLY need more chocolate?!  Frankly, I think everyone's taste-buds are selectively jaded.  I loved the creamy nougat center, and to replace it with ""whipped chocolate"" is selling out to marketing oversell.  I won't buy them again....ever!"
1.0,"Junk, don't waste your money","Junk tea.  20% is twigs and chunks of leaves that aren't even rolled.  First one I ordered came in a zip top bag and was OK.  Not a great Keemun (my daily drink), but okay for my morning thermos on the ride in to work.  It came in a plastic coated paper bag with a zip top.  I ran out and decided to order some more.  The second batch (unfortunately I ordered 3...big mistake) came in plastic lined paper roll-down bags like shown in the image.  And it is junk.  I can't even drink it.  It has no flavor.  Forget the fact that there is almost none of the signature Keemun flavor.  There is almost no flavor at all!  If you want to convince somebody that loose leaf tea is worse than Lipton tea bags, this is the stuff to get."
5.0,superb herring,"This german herring is superb, firm, lightly smoked and flavorful and loaded with omega 3 fatty acids. There were two large herring in my can. I would buy a case if I could."
5.0,Sweetest I tried,"I have made my own ghee and purchased various brands of ghee. I have also tried traditional Moroccan ghee ""Smen"" and it can be strong and tangy. I found a review of this brand on an organic/vegan website and it commented on the fresh sweetness of this ghees scent.  That review was right. This is bar none the sweetest scented butter product I have tried. Absolutely delightful. It is more expensive than other brands I have tried.  I am not sure how they process it to get this fresh sweet butter scent but I will use it in my baking when the sweet buttery scent is most noticeable. In sauteing, this delicate scent is covered by meat and or vegatable scents. If you like a ""tangy"" butter scent to cut through with an oregano tinge try ""Smen."" Zamouri spices carries it."
1.0,do not buy this product or anything else from this company,"Can't taste the pumpkin and horrible customer service. If your questioning whether to buy this or not, don't because you will be very dissatisfied and you do not get to return product. This is just a warning."
5.0,Fabulous marmalade,"For those of us who love bitter, strongly flavored jams and marmalade, this is the standard by which all others are judged. Incredible on toast or an English muffin in cold weather, it also is robust enough to be satisfying for a breakfast in the hot summer. I like the added flavor of the peel; those who don't will like the fine cut or the version without peel. This is not a marmalade for wimps."
1.0,stinky,"This thing smells like trash, which I can only assume is intentional, and doesn't trap flies.  I had no success."
5.0,Gano Schokolade,I put this product in my coffee & it tastes fantastic! Coffee is kindof boring without it. Excellent product & super good for you!
5.0,Delicious Snack!,"An excellent alternative to sugary candy bars, Kashi GoLean bars combine the delicious taste of chocolate with the nutritional benefits of Kashi's blend of grains."
1.0,Awful Product...and you can't return for your money back!,"I LOVE Kind bars, but these are terrible.  Upon taking one bite they tasted stale and not like any other Kind bar product I purchase on a regular basis. I litterally had to spit it out after taking a bite...and that's extreme..sorry!!  Steer clear of these new bars, I really think something was wrong with them, again I couldn't return due to Amazon's policy.  Very disappointing."
5.0,Puckerooms really rock,"These candies are a little quirky, somewhat addicting and extremely refreshing.  Fun for your mouth--they leave a nice tangy sensation, so they're great for car trips when you get thirsty but don't want to drink too much liquid."
1.0,Mold all over! Be careful,"This is my second order of Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack from Amazon due to lower price than other stores and I hit the jackpot.  You can see the pictures I upload for this product.  It has mold all over, which even can be seen from outside the bag.  Unfortunately I did not see it and put one in my mouth.  Few seconds afterward, the taste was so strange and my friend, who was about to eat, stop me from swallowing.  Try for yourself, but please be careful."
1.0,"They literally gave me 6 tiny, broken pieces of chip.","I opened one of these terra chip bags and to my surprise, 6 crummy pieces of broken chips were in there. Not even 6 whole chips. 6 chip fragments. Plus, the chips looked totally stale. I returned the bag to the store immediately upon opening it."
1.0,Stale,"These were not good. I've used the crackers and made my own crumbs and they tasted good.  These tasted bad, and were a waste of money as I couldn't use them at all."
5.0,fresh and mild pumkiny flavor,"I usually order the normal organic South African Rooibos Tea and have jugs of this prepared in the fridge for iced tea, use it in my fruit smoothies and even prepare half and half lemon rooibos tea. My brother wanted to try something different and we order a bag of this green Rooibos.  It is a very mild tea leaning towards a pumpkin flavor, the tea in the bag is less aromatic than the normal Rooibos.  It  is a great tea hot or cold if you are looking for very mild color, taste and aroma.  Kind of like green tea with a smear of Rooibos.  If you tried the spiced Chai Rooibos and found it too strong cinnamon flavor, maybe this tea is for your because of this milder taste.  I love strong flavors, my favorite tea is still the original Rooibos, but having of a bag of this one around just to change it up once in a while will be great."
1.0,Maybe it's just me . . .,"but I drink dark roasts all the time, and I thought this one was extremely bitter and acidic.  Bad batch, maybe, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1.0,This tea MESSED me up,"I started drinking this tea 7 months ago and I would drink it every night. During that time my anxiety sky rocketed and depression set it in. I did not even question the tea for this because it kept me regular and my weight balanced, I instead blamed my anxiety on stress. One day last week I was sitting with my mom and she asked about the tea and the ingredients which I never really looked at, I then looked up the plants and herbs used in the tea and they had side effects for anxiety attacks, depression, moodiness. I found the culprit! I immediately stopped drinking the tea and JUST THE NEXT day my anxiety was gone.  This tea was literally making me go insane and I realize now I'd rather do it the natural way and that my mental mind and happiness is definitely better than some slimming tea. Gym and keeping a balanced diet is the way to go! Anxiety and depression is not worth it at all.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TEA!"
5.0,"Great product, great service","Gu is the perfect pick me up for long rides, long hikes, and right before a good work out.  When I'm not hungry but need a boost, Gu does the trick.  I've tried other similar products but Gu gel worked the best in terms of performance and digestion (no upset stomach).  Packaging and delivery was also timely and of quality."
5.0,Truly a honey of a honey!,"This Tuscan chestnut honey has a marvelously deep, rich flavor. Comparing it to supermarket honeys is like comparing a crusty Italian loaf to packaged white bread. It enriches any dish you add it to, but I like it best just spooned on to a slice of toast - or straight off the spoon."
5.0,More than I expected,"This Chai is very fresh, spicy, and aromatic. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package to find that there was far more tea than I had thought. 3oz. of tea is a lot more than I expected to recieve for this price. I will definately buy from Davidson's again the next time my (larger than expected) tea supply runs out."
1.0,Amazon should be ashamed to even carry this.,"""2% Kopi Luwak""  That's the key part in the description of this fake Kopi Luwak coffee.  For my money, 2% might as well be 0%.  Basically they have taken ordinary coffee beans, which may or may not be good beans to begin with, and put in 00.16 ounces of Kopi Luwak beans per pound.  That means this bag contains about 00.30 ounces of Kopi Luwak as it's a 200 gram bag.  My point?  Drinking a cup of this is not drinking a cup of Kopi Luwak, but just a very expensive cup of normal coffee, period.  Amazon should be ashamed to be selling this.  Enjoy your fake Kopi Luwak coffee."
5.0,One of my favorite kitchen items!,I make my own almond milk and I strain juice when I make it (like to get rid of all the pulp).  This is so simple and so fabulous!  I hang it on a hook to dry and it's ready for me every time I want to  use it.  Thanks Raw Food World for such a great product!
1.0,Tastes like mouthwash,"I bought this thinking it would taste like a peppermint patty, like another reviewer said. It tasted so overwhelming bad that I literally could not take a second sip. The mint taste is extremely strong. It's almost as strong as drinking mouthwash! And that's exactly what it tastes like.  Completely undrinkable."
1.0,Blah bread that sticks to the pan,"I've been buying Bob's Red Mill bread mixes for about a year now. I like the 10 Grain Bread and, even more, the Potato Bread. I was disappointed by the Wonderful Bread. It requires more added ingredients, esp. eggs and egg whites. As a result, I was expecting something with more flavor. But the bread just tastes like regular white bread. It is softer than the 10 Grain - again, similar to packaged white bread. I use a bread machine. I've never had a problem with any other bread mix. But the Wonderful bread sticks to the sides of the pan. As a result, the finished loaf is always broken with large tears and holes on all sides. I suppose I could get past this if the bread was indeed Wonderful. But it isn't. It's just blah."
1.0,MADE IN CHINA!,I was VERY excited to find this snack and opened it right away. They tasted amazing & I couldn't believe the great price for the product! THEN I found out they are MADE IN CHINA! You've got to be kidding me! I seriously have a problem with that & will be returning the products from Mr's May's that I've yet to open. I cannot believe they are stating they're a all natural healthy snack. Who even knows what's really in them!
1.0,Terrible Service,"If you're looking to receive this in less than 2 weeks you're going to have to pay extra shipping. The FREE shipping they offer will cost you a couple of weeks before you receive your merchandise. As for the product, the coffee is great."
1.0,Bring back the original React gum!,"I was a huge fan of the original React gum, but the React2 gum is dreadful. It smells like Vicks vap-o-rub and tastes like generic sugary-minty lose-its-flavor gum. Avoid it."
5.0,Really nice!,"After buying a box at a store, I found these for a great price on Amazon.  At first, I thought the tea would go well with milk and sugar, but when I tried it, I just love it black (no calories - yay!).  There's a subtle scent and taste of both vanilla and caramel that make this so amazing."
1.0,Delivered broken,"I should have gone by previous reviews and passed on this item.  The lollipops were just about all broken.  I had about 2 good ones out of a dozen. They were wrapped in bubble wrap, so I have to wonder if they were broken before even shipping..  I don't even want to be bothered with trying to exchange them.  I'm pretty disappointed."
1.0,First Review: Cant get rid of them!,"Order full box, tastes horrible. No one will eat it, brought it to the office, few people tried it and spit it out. Bought it because of reviews, hopefully no one else buys it."
1.0,The Quality,"I recently purchased a box of this candy at See's and all three of us noticed the dark chocolate was very good, but it lacked the molasses flavor. I was able to return it to the Northridge store for a refund, but found after the fact, that the box of half dark chocolate caramels and butterscotch squares had a sugary inner part as well. I and the other people believe See's is cutting corners in what they make."
5.0,Love it!,"This is so yummy! It's the exact same thing as the Kraft Mac & Cheese powdered sauce. I like to use this with healthier pasta, so you get the same box-taste (which kids like) but better nutrition."
5.0,Great product,I love this product I feel really energized when I drink it.  I really love the fact that it's all natural and give me a energy boost in the middle of the day. If you're on the line about trying to give it a shot! It has a great citrus taste and no funny after taste.
1.0,Unpalatable,"I love coffee. I love the scent of it when it brews. I love the taste with a bit of cream and some sweetener. I love it and I drink a lot of it. I've tasted everything from high dollar gourmet blends to cheap supermarket standards just to see which I prefer the most. I'm sometimes as finicky about my coffee as a wine connoisseur is about a robust pinot noir.  That's why, when I brewed a pot of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and tested it, I had to get a second opinion. I hated it. It was horrible on every level. The scent of the grounds as I was preparing the pot was my first clue: not only did they not smell like any coffee I've ever smelled, but the scent was almost a burned rubber odor that, when brewing, permeated the house like day old stink.  And then there was the taste.  I can't speak to whether or not it does what it's purported to do - ease the sensitive stomachs of those for whom normal coffee is too acidic (which occasionally includes me, especially when I drink a cup at night). I can't speak on that because there was no way, after four or five mouthfuls, I was going to force myself to drink any more to find out. Call me crazy, but I sort of expected the coffee, low acid French Roast or not, to taste like coffee. Not like soaked sweat socks poured over radial tires. It may very well be low acid, but the aftertaste alone makes heartburn preferable.  But I know that I'm finicky about coffee, so before I became too hasty in my rush to judgement, I secured a second opinion from my father. My father who loves coffee even more than I, but unlike myself, has never met a cup he couldn't drink, and thinks that drinking the two day old swill at the bottom of a scorched pot is better than wasting it to brew fresh. He drinks it black, likes it strong, and has been known to tolerate even my aunt's coffee...and that, for anyone who's tried it, is saying something.  So when he poured himself a cup of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and settled in his chair, I watched him for his reaction, expecting him to razz me for my persnickety tastes. He drank half a cup, got up, and poured the rest of the cup and the whole of the remaining pot down the drain.  That pretty much says it all."
5.0,"Scrumptious, organic and gluten free!","I adore dark chocolate and found these cookies to be ultra-satisfying.  Their flavor was superb, as was the texture -- crisp without being hard, and the yummy chocolate chunks...of course, it was nice to at least pretend to be virtuous by purchasing and consuming them (""I'm supporting organic foods!"")!  Let's face it, some cookies (and other foods) that purport to be healthier for you than others taste like cardboard.  These aren't like that.  In fact, my only complaint is that it's hard to stop eating them once I've opened a box!  But then, we all know that dark chocolate is a good source of antioxidants, so..."
5.0,A great tea!,This is a fantastic tea.  Very easy to drink and I find that this company pays a lot of attention to quality. Someone told me about this particular tea after it was highly voted at the World Tea Expo show.  I would recommend this for anyone that likes a great flavored tea.
5.0,good coffee,I use this coffee with my toddy cold press system and it makes a very smooth cup of coffee. I so far have only used Folgers coffee with the system and see no reason to change as the end result is so very good.
5.0,Taste really good,These noodles are real tasty. I eat them almost every day with beef broth or beans. I have tried other brands and found these were the best tasting.
1.0,Tastes like evil,This is the worst tasting protein I have ever eaten. It is the Indiana Jones and the crystal skull of the protein world.
5.0,Yay Bread!,"I discovered that I was gluten-intolerant about a year ago and have been looking for good-tasting wheat-free products ever since.  My primary roadblock has been bread - every single loaf of gluten-free bread I've tried has been beyond disgusting.  I've been to health food store after health food store and haven't found a single loaf that I can eat without gagging.  I thought it was hopeless until I read the reviews of Pamela's Amazing Wheat-Free Bread Mix.  I decided to give it a shot, so I borrowed my sister-in-law's bread machine and fired up a loaf.  Simply put, I was amazed at the results.  Does it taste like regular bread?  No.  Well, almost.  Is it light-years beyond any other gluten-free breads?  A hearty, resounding YES!  If you've eaten other gluten-free (GF) breads before, let me give you a comparison: it holds up better than pre-made GF bread, but it still feels like it could fall apart easily.  Putting a slice in the toaster helps with that.  It's a little on the chewy side.  It tastes like it doesn't have any salt in it, so adding some butter really helps.  It kind of looks like banana bread, if I were to compare textures.  Make sure to have some milk on-hand because it makes you pretty thirsty when you eat it!  I would say this is 90% - 95% as good as ""real"" bread.  Thank goodness, my search for wheat-free bread is over!  And Amazon sells it for nearly half the price as my local health food stores!  If you're the only gluten-intolerant or Celiac in your family, I would recommend picking up a bread machine.  It makes one loaf automatically.  All I did was to follow the direction on the package and the loaf came out perfectly.  It was as simple as dumping the ingredients in the machine, making sure the settings were right, and hitting the ""On"" button.  So easy, even a caveman could do it!  I put the bread machine to work at about 9pm at night and woke up the next morning to freshly-baked GLUTEN-FREE bread.  EDIBLE bread.  Awesome!  I used a older Zojirushi machine, but some of the newer models like from Breadman actually have a Gluten-Free setting on them.  There is hope for decent-tasting bread for us gluten-intolerant people!  THANK YOU Pamela's Products!!"
1.0,"Artificial flavor, made from concentrate","I got hooked on coconut water while traveling in the Philippines. Since then I've been trying to find a packaged product that tastes like the real deal. There are a few decent brands out there. This particular product, however, is made from concentrate and tastes just like the plastic it is packed in. I didn't even finish the bottle."
1.0,This stuff is nasty,"I love the Alo line of fruit juices, but this stuff is just nasty.  It tastes like the borscht my mom used to make me eat when I was a kid.  I thought I'd be getting something similar to a V8 Splash, but that's just not the case.  The cooked cabbage flavor just overwhelms the beverage, and I couldn't even finish half the bottle.  I have to strain the Alo pulp with any of the Alo juices I drink because having floaties in my beverages triggers a gag reflex for me.  But in this case, the gag reflex was triggered even with the Alo pulp strained.  I'll be ordering more Alo juices in the future, but definitely not this one."
5.0,Delicious!,"This candy bar is my children's absolute favorite! It is not too sweet in comparison to other American candy bars, has a nice crunch and size is just right!"
1.0,nothing special,Too expensive for a bland olive oil. There are so many superior olive oils in this price range with better flavor.
1.0,Terrible,"I was truly disappointed when I received this product.  It didn't work with my machine, and it was a total Waste of money."
5.0,my cats can't get enough,"I have tried a lot, I mean a whole lot of cat food.  My two cats are so picky and I can never really tell what they will eat.  They loved the first can of this and I thought, well, we will see what happens in a coupld days.  They go through food like Sherman through Atlanta and even though I have only had the food for a couple of days, they have eaten six cans!  Little piglets.  I love this food.  The consistency is nice and juicey and my cats appreciate that.  If you are looking for a good quality, tasty food, order this."
1.0,Major False Advertizing Here,"this is so unbelievably horrible!  what it claims, the packaging, the wording, etc... anyone who makes a child drink this should be arrested for child abuse. i know, kind of extreme... just trying to make a point.  I almost bought this because the price, sounds like a good deal.  I decided to find out whats in it first.  sounds fairly easy, but noooooo.  good luck finding the ingredients.  kraft website??? nope!  here on amazon??? nope!  simply web search??? nope! I found it on kmart of all sites.  they listed the ingredients, thanks kmart.  #1 Water #2 High Fructose Corn Syrup #3 Citric Acid #4 Sucrolose (aka splenda) which is made by taking sugar grown naturally, slicing out part of its dna, and adding in a molecule from bleach.  think GMO, and tastes like crap to boot. #5 something called ""Natural Flavor"".  check it out from the FDA: under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22)  So basically we have no idea what that is.  but clearly it offers zero nutritional value  So thank you Kraft and Capri sun for trying to sell me poisonous sugar water masked as health food for my children!"
1.0,Where's the Amaretto??,"Astounding that this coffee has no smell or taste of amaretto whatsoever. I know it's decaf but it doesn't even smell or taste like coffee. It's bitter and has an odd flavor. Worst of all, you can't return food items. I wasted $36."
5.0,Great Pasta,"Love the montebello product line.  It tastes good, holds up nicely and is great with sauces.  My favorite pasta in the US."
1.0,"If I wanted hair this greasy, I just wouldn't wash it!","I have curly hair; like seriously curly hair. Additionally, it gets all frizzy whenever it's even the least bit humid. I have tried deep cleansers and balms before so I thought that I would take a stab with this one. The first thing I noticed is that the smell was fantastic! I wanted to put a wick in it and burn it like a candle. The second thing I noticed is that it was very greasy to the touch. Previously, I have put balm in my hair while washing and waited 15 minutes or so and then washed it out. Other times, I have only used the products once my hair is clean and dry and I use it to style. I tried both of these ways and ended up with the same disaster on my hands: greasy, gross hair! You might ask why I tried both of these ways and didn't just read the instructions. Funny you should ask! There are no instructions or directions on the container....AT ALL. I looked everywhere and under all of the labels and found nothing.  Therefore, I was left on my own to try to figure it out. When I put it in my hair while washing, it took almost a week to get my hair to stop feeling greasy. No matter how many times I wash it, it looked like I had dipped my head in a deep fryer. When I used it for styling, the same problem occurred!  Maybe I am from another hair product planet, but all I can say is that you should pass on this product. That being said, I kept mine because I like the smell!"
1.0,I couldn't stop gagging,"I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's brownies--add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as ""brownie bite"" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1/2C applesause instead of oil!"
1.0,Price?,Unless I'm reading something wrong on here than this product can be purchased for a significantly cheaper price by ordering directly from tassimo.com
5.0,Cant say anything that hasnt already been said!,"Well it is coconut oil... So yeah, good stuff. lol I use it on my two month old's face and even in her hair for cradle cap. It works really well for a skin moisturizer especially for babies and toddlers because it is so mild and smells like food! I caught my three old daughter licking her hands after I put it on her one day. I have yet to cook with it since I just started using it like a week ago, but I am actually planning on using it in the kitchen.  UPDATE: I use this on a daily basis for cooking. I love sauteing mushrooms and onions in it, and my day doesn't go so well without my eggs fried in coconut oil. It is so good for you! Before anyone knocks the amount of saturated fat in it, do some research on the benefits CERTAIN KINDS of saturated fat. They are not all equal. I have also been using this as a diaper rash remedy for my two year old. It works way better than any other cream I have used. And I have used them all..."
5.0,No more gas.  Happy puppies!,My dogs eat a. Natural diet and sometimes get a little gasy. This product really helps! My dogs line up for.Fart Busters and think they're treats.  One tip.keep them in the refrigerator...they last longer. Amazon has the best price and shipping is fast.
1.0,Low Quality. High Calorie and Fat.,"I wanted to love this. I was even prepared for it to be somewhat like a cheap Circle K Cappuccino. Unfortunately, the product itself is really greasy. You actually see grease in the cup. It is 80 calories per serving and the taste it really really powder tasting, like powdered milk.  I wasn't expecting a Starbucks Cap out of the K-Cup, but I was expecting a little more than this.  I read the reviews and they were sort of mixed, so I chose to try it, but I won't buy these again. They will sit on the top cupboard shelf till i am desperate I guess or throw them away. Three boxes of them... EESSSH  I also now realize these aren't eligible for return... so that sucks. Oh well, buyer beware, right!"
1.0,"Amazon's ingredient listing is totally wrong, kinda scammy!","So I just received my 2 bottles of this stuff...  I looked at the ingredients list... you will not believe what I read....  So the first 4 ingredients that Amazon list for this are: ""Red Raspberry Puree, Blackberry Puree, Beet Sugar, Tea Infusion""  Sounds good right? Yes, that is why I bought it because the first 2 ingredients are fruit puree.  So this is what the first 4 ingredients on the actual package are:  ""INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, WATER, SEEDLESS BLACKBERRY PUREE, SEEDLESS RED RASPBERRY PUREE""  guess what the 5th ingredient is?  ""NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS""  some other ingredients on my packaging that aren't listed on Amazon are ""CELLULOSE GUM, MALIC ACID, POTASSIUM SORBATE, CARRAGEENAN, GUAR GUM, XANTHAN GUM, RED #40 AND BLUE #1""  Hold on a second!!!  That is a HUGE difference, I thought I was buying a product that was mostly puree with some ""beet sugar"" to sweeten it but instead I bought 2 large bottles of Sugar with water in it and a small amount of fruit puree added, and then artificial flavoring!  Bait and switch technique for sure!  Amazon.... why????"
5.0,Fantastic ice tea,"We wanted something refreshing but not just plain decaf ice tea.  This is wonderful tea.  Tart without sugar but that is the way I like it.  Really nice change.  We added one cup of decaf black tea and it is good that way too, but it is even nice by itself.  If you would like a nice change (without something that you find keeping you up at night), and a tart but wonderful flavor and color, this is the tea.  My hubby puts sweetner in it and loves it too--and he does not usually drink tea, so that is saying something...."
1.0,hideous rancid taste,"I bought this after trying the brownie mix which was outstanding.  The dark brown blob that is supposed to be a chocolate chip, tasted rancid and not in any way chocolate.  Utterly disgusting product.  I suffered from stomach issues later that night"
1.0,Well know but Far from the Best.,"I've kept a bottle of Tabasco in my kitchen for more decades than I care to admit.  I've used it in Bloody Marys and added a few drops to many dishes I wanted to ""kick up"" a notch.  I'm embarrassed to say I never experimented with any other brand of hot sauce until recently. Huge mistake!  After a bit of taste testing I have to say Tabasco is one of the worse hot sauces available. Cayenne Pepper and a lot vinegar are Tabasco's major flavor notes. You can do much better! You won't miss all that bitter vinegar!  I could provide a long list of hot sauces that are much better. Here are just a few and I choose them because they are all widely distributed (sold here on Amazon and in your supermarket): Huy Fong Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce,  Cholula Hot Sauce, and Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce are all far superior. There are many others  Once you get away from Tabasco and its bitter vinegar after-taste you open up a whole new world. There are a lot of superior hot sauces. Things have certainly improved since the late 1800s when Tabasco was first developed"
1.0,BUYER BEWARE--NO RETURNS,These products were terrible tasting. My husband is Indian and said the taste was terrible. I agreed. When I went to return the unopened packages I could not so so. They have a no return policy. Now I will have to toss out $40 worth of unused product. Amazon is always so very good about returns but evententaly some of their vendors are not.
1.0,"Very sweet, decent hot coco, but not drinking chocolate to me","To me, drinking chocolate should be thick, nearly like a melted chocolate bar in a cup.  This wasn't anything close, and way too much sugar."
5.0,This item will make your life easier!,"I have three cats.  One cat takes two pills twice a day. Another cat takes one pill twice a day.  Every day was like a fire drill getting my cats to eat food with pills mashed up.  Now, my life is so much easier by putting the pills in the Salmon Pill Pockets and hiding the Pockets in their food. Through experimenting, I found that cutting the Pill Pockets in half and molding the Pocket around the pill to make a smaller piece is much better at fooling my cats. The Salmon Pockets are softer and more malleable than the Chicken Pockets."
1.0,Poor flavor,"To me, the flavor is not good. I threw out the remainder without finishing it."
1.0,Didn't Work,"Too bad, they didn't work for me; I took 3 pills 3 to 4 times/day for about 2 weeks with no results.  In fact, they seemed to dry me up more, so I stopped using them.  I'm going to try drinking more water and eating oatmeal..."
5.0,Heaven.,I hate coffee but love a nice hot cup of chai.  I have tried several options for home use and all of them have come up short.  Until the Chai Latte K-Cups.  OMG.  It's just like what I get from the coffee shop.  Having these available to me have pretty much guaranteed I will never order another one ever again.  And only takes 2-3 minutes to brew.
5.0,Eye Opener,"This is a great start to the morning.  I have very little taste or smell sense a head injury a few years ago, but I can tell when I drink this as opposed to another."
5.0,LOVE DFH,"DFH paleo cleanse has become part of my daily routine.  Nothing that I have tried - vitamins, powders, etc. has given me the energy and vitality that this product delivers."
5.0,Good price for good product,"Beside this product we tried 3 others corn flour for cooking polenta.  We like this corn flour because of its better texture. As well, the price here is more reasonable compare to the groceries that we used to buy it from."
1.0,Gross (and contains Life's DHA),"Update:  I deleted my old review, because it caused confusion and did not relate directly to this specific product. However, I will stand by my decision to discontinue my family's use of any product from The Hain Celestial Group, Inc. (Earth's Best products fall under this company).  If you read my old review, I apologize for not specifying that this specific product does not have BPA in the packaging. I did not mean to cause confusion.  I also failed to specify my exact problems with this specific product:  It made my daughter gassy She normally spit up at least 1/4 of her bottle (she rarely spits up since we switched to Nature's One Baby's Only Organic Soy Formula) I don't care for a couple of the ingredients:  Life's DHA (uses Martek's Hexane method) and corn syrup  ***Just so you are aware (I was not), the Obama administration banned the use of DHA and ARA in certified organic baby formula and cereal back in 2010. References:  [...]"
1.0,Not liked by either dog,"These are just glorified rawhide chews.Both dogs turned up their noses,my little one chewed for about 2 minutes and just ignores it.I generally like their products,rinse,tooth paste etc but I won't buy these again.I thought they were like checkups and greenies but they aren't.If your dog likes rawhide then you'll be ok if not you have wasted your money."
5.0,for those who  love egg creams,"Though the chocolate egg cream is considered the ""default"" egg cream I find  the vanilla egg cream even better. The essential ingredient in both is Fox's U-Bet  syrup. The nuanced delicacy of this SUPERB product is so splendid that it renders all other brands redundant. If I have an egg cream as my aperatif at luncheon I find that it insults my palate. I have found that  the U-Bet vanilla egg  cream is perfect for cocktail time or as a morning wake up drink. For diversity I will sometimes use Fox's equally splendid chocolate syrup--and to be able to order it online! A blessing! I think it was Voltaire or perhaps SJ Perleman who said ""A life with Fox's U-Bet vanilla syrup is a life lived in vain"""
5.0,Fondarific was fantastic!,"I was very pleasantly surprised by the taste, texture, and color of this fondant. It rolled out easily for me and even stayed pliable for my kids to play with the leftovers...over and over again. I am currently planning to buy Fondarific Fondant in black because it is so much easier and tastes much better than even the stuff I've made with marshmallows."
1.0,Furniture Polish Taste,"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
5.0,Love this for my smoothies,"I add this to my daily smoothies and I LOVE it.  It enhances the fruitiness and I enjoy knowing that I am getting good quality nutrients from the goji berries.  I also get my goji berries from Nativas and they are always delicious.  I buy all my powders from Navitas on Amazon.  If you like chocolate smoothies try the cacao powder you won't be sorry.  I use cacao powder instead of cocoa powder, it's more beneficial.  Best thing ever is I use the Subscribe and save and I get a small % off and get auto shipments at the frequency I need."
1.0,Broke in less than a week,"I was very disappointed when this toy broke in less than a week. It was advertised as being durable plastic, but it couldn't stand up to our beagle dropping it repeatedly to get the treats out. The plastic lid on the bottom cracked and broke off less than a week after our dog began playing with the toy. The broken plastic pieces are very sharp and would have been dangerous if our dog had not been supervised."
1.0,The WORST tasting Mac and Cheese EVER!,"I won't take up too much of your time. This is the singular worst tasting Shells and Cheese (Mac and Cheese) product I've ever had. The cheese has the most bitter aftertaste and is so unappealing even my cats would not eat it! I rarely, if ever, review food products but this one is so bad that I felt I must just to do my public duty!  So, for our house, its 6 thumbs and 8 paws down! Awful!"
1.0,Stale,"Typically this is wonderful coffee, but this last order wasn't. No flavor and even the color of the bean was not right. I now will no longer order this coffee. Canned coffee has much more flavor."
5.0,Bold Coffee,We recently purchased the Keurig Coffee maker after a recommendation and initially had difficulty finding the right blend. This blend is good for those who enjoy a bold coffee with a hint of French roast.   The convenience of ordering from Amazon along with an incentive coupon makes the coffee buying process easier.   We are happy customers.
1.0,toooo  many  calories,i did know how many calories the cookies  wow !!!!!  its  my  fault  and  there not  that good what a mistake two boxes for the food bank they go.......waste of money
5.0,"A Refreshing Combination of Shampoo, Conditioner, and Scalp Therapy","I enjoy the fresh clean feeling of my hair and scalp after shampooing with the NEW! Clear Men Scalp Therapy, 2 in 1 Clean & Refresh, Anti-Dandruff, Daily Shampoo & Conditioner. I especially like the convenience of the combination of shampoo and conditioner, the anti-dandruff application, and the sense of scalp health after a vigorous scalp massage combined with the blend of the nutria, ginseng, and mint & tea tree ingredients of the men's scalp therapy product.  I appreciate the assurance that frequent application of the product will insure that my scalp and hair are moisturized, manageable, and healthy."
5.0,Adorable,"Put on a 6"" cake for the parents. Put skewers into cake to hold the weight So it wouldn't sink. It was so Adorable & the parents loved it."
5.0,Jelly Belly's Rule,"They are the most delicious Jelly Beans around. Hands down. I wish they sold a 50-lb container. If they did, i would likely purchase it."
5.0,Grownup Healthy Poptart! Yummy!!,"These are the best ""healthy"" snack we have come across. I love sweets but can't do poptarts knowing how unhealthy they are. These are the best alternative out there. Yeah they are quite a bit smaller but they are soo good... the 2 smaller portions actually satisfy. I really hope these do not disappear(as it seems things I find I really love do)  :(  Stock up on them when you find them! Both the bluberry and strawberry are equally delicious!"
5.0,Finally a treat my cats will eat!,"I didn't know these came in Salmon - we had been buying the Rabbit ones and all kitties unanimously loved them so I thought we'd try these ones - and again it was a clean sweep - everyone went crazy and meowed for more!  Best of all they are only one calorie - so my ""catkids"" don't get any fatter - LOL!  Natural Balance pet foods are our favorite!"
1.0,Poor quality,These nuts were overpriced and the quality was not good.  Many were discolored and tasted stale.  I would not buy them again.
1.0,dried potatoes,"I really did not like these potatoes at all. I thought they tasted worse than most of the others I've tried. I have to admit that I am a fan of whole potatoes, but I like to keep a box of potato flakes on hand. My husband likes dried potatoes, but he did not like these."
5.0,Consistent and Classic,"This is the curry powder I started with years ago. As I got more into Indian cuisine, I tried other brands and even mixed my own blends, but this still has the benchmark flavor for home cooking. The pepper, ginger, and other elements are in perfect balance making it a great seasoning for any protein or veggie. The only adjustment you have to make at home is with salt or red pepper."
5.0,Gorgeous color and easy to work with,I used this fondant to create dice to add to cupcakes for a Bunko for the Cure fundraiser.  They came out awesome and were a huge hit!  The fondant color was vibrant (matched the real dice that we used to play with.  This fondant is so incredibly easy to work with and it tasted delicious.  Even the non-fondant lovers in the crowd (including me) loved the taste! I look forward to using this product again....and again....and again!
5.0,Great Dip!,Love this product!  I make it up as a dip instead of the cheeseball recipe!  Always a BIG HIT! =) Great price too!!
5.0,Beautiful!,"This candy not only tastes good but it is beautiful to look at.  I display mine in an apothecary jar and they look amazing.  I had a problem with breakage on the first order, but the company took care to send me a replacement and they are in great shape."
5.0,hurray for *REALLY* biodegradeable poopsacks!,I love these bags.  I hate the idea that I'm spending money on something to pick up dog shi+ but I like that there are less plastic bags clogging up the landfills and oceans.  The bags are sturdy enough that they don't fall apart in your hands and your fingers won't break them when you're scooping.
5.0,This is my brand of tea,"I first came across this brand with Starbucks. Since I don't drink much coffee, I had a hard time finding this in the grocery stores. Needless to say, I am eternally grateful for Amazon providing this. I bought a sampler box and still haven't gotten through the whole box."
1.0,Horrible.,"I bought this with high hopes but was very disappointed.  The coffee had a very stale flavor and after brewing, it had a faint odor of cigarette ashes.  I made one cup of this coffee and threw the rest of the k-cups in the trash.  I will never buy this again."
1.0,Terrible! Terrible! Terrible!,"These Wine Gums are a travesty, whose only vaguely comparable aspect to Maynard's Wine Gums is that their title contains the words ""gums"" and ""wine"".  I bought these in a store in Ann Arbor, MI, and I wish I had never parted with the cash.  Frankly, the manufacturer should be supported by the Chocolate candy industry as a useful tool in their marketing arsenal to ward people from ever trying anything that did not broadly contain chocolate, and towards their own advertised products.  They are effectively some kind of gum, that has been colored.  Nothing more.  They are flavorless, and seem more like they were the very first attempt to make Wine Gums while the company were just working towards the right consistency - an effort still clearly in progress.  I'd brand these 'Wine Gums version 0.001'!  Maynard's - despite not being the gold-standard - are still massively better than these, and anyone looking to partake of true Wine Gums will find a better experience going with that variety."
1.0,Ok but...,"I didn't realize that this product was gluten, egg and dairy-free.  If you had those dietary restrictions, you would probably think these were pretty yummy.  Since I don't, though, I would not buy them again."
1.0,pure sugar,i love this paste and was hoping to enjoy it- but it is so sweet that it kills the chestnut taste completely. would not recommend!
1.0,Very tough to chew,I don't know if I got a bad bag or what from the good reviews I have read but these were the toughest gummi bears I have ever had.  They were hard to chew to the point where your mouth would begin to hurt.  I still have about four pounds remaining after a couple months now since they aren't enjoyable to eat.  The taste isn't the greatest either unless you let them set in you mouth for a while but the toughness just makes them very unenjoyable.  Maybe its just a bad bag but I have no reason to say these are good if they weren't and that is my experience so far.
1.0,Stubborn retailer refuses to correct error,"I thought I had found a perfect Christmas gift for an out of town sister who is allergic to chocolate.  I ordered and shipped a gift basket called ""Something Sweet & Savory.""  It contained no chocolate.  I was on vacation when the basket arrived and did not hear that my sister received a gift basket containing primarily chocolate until I returned home January 1. I contacted Wine.com immediately.  They replied that she should return the basket and they would ship another one.  My sister had tossed the packing box by that time and had no way to return the basket.  I again contacted Wine.com and they gave the same reply.  ""Return the basket first.""  She cannot use the contents or return the basket.  Stalemate.  Wine.com offered NO OTHER REMEDY.  And -- to add insult to injury -- my sister never did receive a package of Harry & David chocolate covered nuts.  I will never order from this retailer again. Wine.com Something Sweet & Savory Gift Basket "
5.0,Great product,This is great popcorn.  We make it in a stir crazy and almost every kernel pops and it tastes so good.  We had family visiting and they fell in love with it and now they steal a bag everytime they come over.  This is by far the best.
5.0,Tea at it its best in a large package.,The teapot hardly ever get all the way cold in my house and this large 2 pound  pack will keep me going with tea at its best. Add this to my other pack of 3 pound +  pack of PG tips and I wont have to buy tea for about 6 months or more. Add just a little milk and no sugar. It even tastes good on a hot day! Shipped and received well ahead of the expected date and arrived with very adequate packaging.   Chris
5.0,"Handy for travel, backpacking and drinking carb, calorie and sugar free!","Mio works great if you want to sweeten water, especially as a substitute for soda.  For people who choose to eat low carb, such as the Atkins method, this provides a way to enjoy a sweet tasting drink without the carb or sugar penalty.  I wanted to avoid diet soda and anything sweetened by Aspartame too (as suggested in the Atkins book). MIO is just the ticket (it's sweetened by Splenda). This stuff is small, easy to use and tastes good to. It helps me to drink plenty of water and provides easy travel options. I also use it to flavor water when camping, hiking, at work and on weekend trips. The bottle is so small and light and sweetens 24 cups worth of water.  When I first started using this, I would over flavor things. After just a few times it's easy to determine about how much to squeeze into the size of container you are using. The fluid is very concentrated so be careful not to splash or spray it on your clothes. 1 bottle lasts me several days and I drink it all day long. It dissolves instantly, just a little stir and your drink is ready. If you really crave the Soda fizz, you can add it to plain soda water too.  Mango Peach is my favorite flavor.  I rank the flavors about like this: 1. Mango Peach 2. Fruit Punch 3. Strawberry Watermelon 4. Orange Tangerine 5. Berry Pomegranate  The price varies wildly, check your local stores too. Give it a shot and you'll be happy you did.  5 stars for a great product, providing a carb free option."
1.0,A.V.O.I.D.  -  tastes like plastic bottle,"Encouraged by the Jack Daniels brand BBQ sauce: ""   Jack Daniel's Barbecue Sauce, Original No. 7 Recipe, 28-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)  "", I ventured into what I thought might be familiar territory with the Sticky Fingers Tennessee Whiskey barbecue sauce.  Mistake.  It was foul. Absolutely foul.  Only half-good part of tasting this BBQ sauce was the laugh I had when my wife, upon tasting the product, exclaimed: ""this tastes like the plastic bottle!""  I wish the outcome had been different.  A.V.O.I.D. unless you like the taste of Polyethylene terephthalate."
1.0,Can't rate what I never got,I CAN NOT RATE A PURCHASE THAT I NEVER RECEIVED AS I FIND IT HARD TO WRITE A REVIEW FOR.
5.0,Mild tasting green tea,"To me, most green tea has a very strong, raw taste . . . like drinking liquid grass. But, this green tea with orange, passionfruit, and jasmine is very mild and pleasant. I prefer mine with just a little sweetener, such as honey. I'm also a coffee drinker, but when I'm feeling a bit out of sync, this green tea has a soothing, settling effect. I keep a few tea bags in my purse because I find restaurant coffee usually dissatisfying. Rather than paying $2.00 for a cup of something that I don't even enjoy, I just ask for a cup or small pot of hot or boiling water, and pluck my own tea bag in! My meal is so much more enjoyable . . . plus I save the cost of a bad tasting cup of coffee!"
5.0,"Fontana White Chocolate Mocha Sauce, 63 fl oz","The product was awesome, better than having to go to Starbucks. This is the same sauce they use in your White Chocolate Mocha so you can have your favorite hot mocha for a fraction of the cost.."
1.0,Stains Everything,"This is a delicious tea.  I bought a canister of it at Whole Foods, and used most of it up pretty quickly.  Then I noticed that my teeth had turned color.  After noticing that, it occurred to me that pretty much everything that had come into contact with this tea, including my mugs, tea spoons, spatula, stove-top pot, had turned color a bit.  A professional cleaning at the dentist, and a lot of soaking and scrubbing of my mugs, helped a lot -- but be warned that this tea (at least the batch I got) can wreck your smile very quickly.  I won't drink it again."
5.0,Arizona Sugar Free Green Tea with Ginseng Iced Tea. I love this stuff.,"I will soon be 73 years of age. In my lifetime, I have consumed many flavors and types of soft drinks. Arizona Green Tea is the best tasting of all to my old taste buds. I like the kind that Amazon.com sells better [ASIN:B001THXOIS AriZona Sugar Free Green Tea with Ginseng Iced Tea Mix, 1.7-Ounce Tubs in Cannister (Pack of 4)], than the pre-mixed, liquid variety. I think it has a milder, better taste.  After mixing a pitcherful, you can use the left over little container for storing little things. Or, do as l do and sort your pills into it. I am not kidding; those containers are handy little things to have around.  As is normally true, Amazon.com offers the best price to be found. Amazon.com's subscription plan is an especially good deal.  I strongly recommend buying this product from Amazon.com on a subscription basis. Then, you will never run out. And you will not find a better price anywhere. I have found none as good."
1.0,Caution,"May possibly contain genetically modified organisms. Do you want to be part of a science experiment? Google ""can GMOs be harmful to your health?"""
5.0,Overpriced,I love these gummy bears but I can buy the same bag 6 lb bag for $5.96 at SamsClub.  Thus the Amazon price is a rip off.  I wish Amazon would work to provide us the lowest prices.
5.0,Delicious and healthy - Organic EV Coconut Oil,"I'm a recent convert to the overwhelming benefits of coconut oil. I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.  It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up."
1.0,Rancid and disgusting.  Coconut puke.,"A yellow pus-like liquid ensued from the carton when I poured it, and only if it had tasted as good as pus, I might be less nauseated right now.  If you want to have a few days off work, drink this, it will make you sick enough to convince even a tropical diseases doctor you've got a vicious strain of the ebola virus."
1.0,"Great olives, terrible packaging, unusable","I have purchased these olives from Amazon in the can. They were excellent. Though Roland still sells the cans, Amazon decided to stock these plastic tubs instead. Bad idea. Mine arrived with the top completely off, the cardboard box soaked with brine and 3/4 of the olives in the moldy cardboard box. The entire mess was unusable. Amazon did their usual great job of customer service... we received an immediate refund, but the trashcan got the olives, not us. I'd give this sad mess zero stars if I could. Last sad little detail is the big 'Ready To Ship' label on the top of the container. It clearly wasn't."
1.0,Harmful to pets,You would think coming from the name American Kennel Club it would be made in USA.  No.  It's made in china where chicken jerky is deadly to animals.
5.0,hubby's coffee,"This is the blend my husband likes - he likes strong, dark coffee and this seems to fit the bill."
1.0,"Cats say ""No Thanks""","I bought two different flavors of Vita gravy, and I couldn't get either of my cats to even take a lick of them, despite how I served them. I tried to put some on their dry food, they actually didn't eat for hours until I replaced it with just dry food. I tried offering it up solo, to no avail. And I put some on a bit of lettuce, but they still wouldn't take the bait.  I imagine it smells like plastic to them, but both my cats don't go near it after smelling Vita Gravy. I can understand Allstar not liking it - he's... special (which is why I call him ""Allstar""). He's squeamish and weird and he only eats his regular food in small portions throughout the day; never more than a couple of bites at once. If I offer him wet food, he just licks the gravy from that and leaves the meaty portion to Agnes.  Agnes, on the other hand, is a 20 lb vacuum. I've had to pull string out of her anus because she ingested it and couldn't quite push it out of herself. Come to think of it, she doesn't mind chewing on plastic either, so I'm not sure what about Vita Gravy is so unappetizing to her, especially considering what I've shared.  I don't know if other cats go for it, but I have two VERY different cats of my own and neither will eat Vita Gravy. My advice: Bad buy."
1.0,Tastes AWFUL,"I mixed the pouch sent by Amazon.com with water and the taste was cringe-worthy. These days everyone keeps talking about the wonders of both acai and pomegranate as antioxidants that are supposed to be the second coming. They might be or not, but for now I am def. focusing on antioxidants, but this product IS NOT the way to get yout daily doze (unless you have no taste bubs). Truly awful"
1.0,nature's variety - instinct grain free chicken dried catfood,"my cat has loved this food and has truly benefited from it for 5 months, until this delivery. vomit, diarrhea and a refusal to eat any of the food continued until i went to my local store and purchased another bag of the same product - happily with different results."
5.0,Works Good,Have caught several prairie gophers with these.  Easier and more effective than steel traps.  Was taught to avoid placing any unfamiliar odor at the site.  I rub fresh dirt from the site into gloves and traps.  File the wire ends that hold the trigger plate at a slight angle with a fine file so it trips easily.  I close the hole with small stakes and pieces of dirt and then fine dirt to close completely off.  If I don't keep the light and fresh air out they will fill the traps with packed dirt. If the run is active I'll catch one in a few hours.
1.0,"Bland, mostly flavorless white soup with potato","This soup has no discernible dairy or clam flavor at all.  There is a bland white base, chemically thickened, with no hint of milk, butter, or cream.  I found mostly chunks of white potato and a small quantity of tiny, hard, flavorless clam fragments. There is a faint chemical aftertaste and a little sand.  Doesn't taste remotely like any clam chowder I've ever eaten before."
5.0,Love this stuff. It's addictive.,"I love this stuff. It's perfect for movie night! Everyone I introduce it to falls in love with it. Unfortunately all of the grocery stores in Atlanta have stopped stocking it. It's probably because the price has gone up on it, the amount of popcorn in it has gone down AND it has gone down from 4 bags in a box to 3 bags in a box and now only 2 bags per box. It's still worth buying but because of the changes and the difficulty in finding it I eat it much less often than I did before."
1.0,"Love Sprout, BUT NOT this one","My three boys love Sprout foods, but I have tried this one for the last two months, turkey w/herb roasted vegetables, and they won't eat it.  Someone else also mentioned that the herb smell is strong."
1.0,didn't like it,"I love annie chun but this particular soup just does not do it for me personally, however you may love it. The soup has a very unusual taste. I really wanted to like this soup but I will stick to the other flavors that I love."
5.0,best sweetener,"I used splenda for years,  a friend told me to go to amazon and get stevia.Best choice ever lost ten pounds and saved alot of money."
1.0,"Total Disaster: Not as described, NO CANS!!!!!!!","What I got was 6 flimsy cardboard containers of buttermilk shrink-wrapped and no bubblewrap in between box and item, resulting in a total mess of powdered buttermilk everywhere inside the shrink-wrap. 3 of the 6 buttermilk containers were dented  and two of them had the lids off when I got it. Buttermilk powder was everywhere. How do I get a refund or the items sent in cans as the description read? This item is not shippable in flimsy cardboard containers. It must be mailed in cans. That is what I was expecting!!!!!"
5.0,My Mom Loves um.,"I got these for my mother.  My father is recovering from prostate cancer, and has completely changed his diet.  He treats these like desert.  He loves them, and they are so good for him.  Microwaved 15 sec, with some chopped banana a topped with greek yogurt.  They got 8 cases."
1.0,Freshness an issue,"I love Kashi, but this product has been less fresh than what I buy at my local grocery. Maybe I have been eating it less frequently? In any event, I won't be reordering!"
1.0,Horrible,"This was possibly one of the worst tasting spreads I have ever tasted. I bought it because I saw a picture of Tim Schafer (video game developer) holding a bottle of it. Only later did he even tell me (on Twitter) that it was terrible. After trying it myself on a cracker and bread, I can say that it's truly terrible."
1.0,No Longer the Same Product,"I grew up eating Starkist tuna.  It was my favorite above any other brands I tried.  This is not the same tuna it was before.  I noticed a decline in quality for some time.  The tuna had a stronger smell.  There was often nuclear-orange glowing color on top of the tuna.  The size of the cans got smaller.  One can used to yield a few sandwiches.  Now you have to open at least two cans for two people.  When you drain the liquid out, the lid goes so far down because there isn't as much tuna as there used to be.  But that isn't the worst part.  I noticed this year that every can I've opened has had some sort of sludgy gel-like goo surrounding the tuna.  I touched it to see what it was like and it feels like grimy slime.  I wondered if this was a bad batch (we usually buy lots of cans at a time) or some sort of new way they are packing it.  I looked it up and saw others were finding the same thing in their tuna.  I tried eating some of it after getting most of the goo off.  But it did not taste very good.  I now regret eating it at all after reading the following.  Apparently the company was once owned by Del Monte, but was sold to a South Korean tuna company that was hoping to get into the American market.  For what reason?  To poison us?  Seriously, I can't imagine what they put in these cans.  I also read that they refused to provide records to the FDA when asked.  That can't be good.  Why is this stuff still on our store shelves?  Why are American companies selling out to foreign ones all the time?  Americans are finding it harder and harder to afford groceries.  We don't want to spend our money on trash products.  I will never buy Starkist again unless it one day makes its way back to American hands.  There is obviously something wrong with it.  Just look at it and smell it next time you open a can.  It's no longer the tasty tuna of yesteryear.  It is now tuna bits in slimy, tuna-flavored sludge water."
5.0,I LOVE this chai!,Back when I had my second job..many years ago..we served this chai.I got a taste for it YEARS later and was able to find it here on Amazon!I was thrilled and it tasted just as good as I remembered.I think it is perfectly spiced with the right amount of creamy sweetness.I don't like any of the other boxed liquid or other powdered chais out there.Most are too sweet or too much spice.I always go back to this one.
5.0,Yum!,This mix is amazing! It tastes so fresh and is delicious.  Perfect for a a cold evening. I can't wait to try other packets.
5.0,great tasting and good source of fiber,"these are great and fill you up, great for me as I do over night and up at 6am and not off until 8am, so now I don't have to go hungry until I get home, these hold off the hunger until noon."
5.0,"SUPER FLAVOR, NO GAS","The Anasazi lived in small spaces and knew the value of good clean air!  These beans have a wonderful taste, need no soaking, cook fast and best of all NO OR LITTLE GAS. Add your favorite seasoning meat (salt pork, andouille sausage) salt, pepper, roasted garlic bits and a little onion. Fix a pan of cornbread and ENJOY!!!"
1.0,dissapointed,"not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money."
1.0,Nutella Mess - Packets Leaked in Both Boxes. Ruined!,Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella. Package in convenient single servings (great for camping) and sell them. Ordered 2 boxes for a trip to Everest this Spring. Opened both boxes and discovered a mess - leaked packets everywhere. Don't waste your time or money. Better off buying a container from the store. I'm sure this not the first time this has happened.
1.0,These were really bad,"I have had the nacho chili, and they were great.  This was really terrible. Grandkids wouldn't eat them, the smell grossed them out.  Smelled sort of musty and stale or something.  Just a foul smell upon opening the bags...I guess a Poor combination of herbs with the lemon.  They became expensive dog treats."
5.0,Excellent!,"These are one of the few USA-made products that I can feed my dogs.  They love them, and they are healthy!"
1.0,spread,It had a horrable after taste the first time I had it was ok the next it was worst than the first time I had it and the 3rd time I could not eat the sandwich.It has verry bitter taste
5.0,Just like the original,"This is the closest you can get to the original Nesbitt's Orange that was sold the during 1940's, 1950's, 1960's and into the 1970s.  Everything since has used artificial flavor and corn syrup.  The flavor is amazing."
5.0,Best Cat Food EVER!,"My cat loves weruva, this cat food was recommended to me by a vet. I like that my cat has so many different flavor choices- I think it is healthy for her."
1.0,well no yet!,"wel can't say nothing yet, I haven't got any chance to try this - I'll post when do anything with it!"
5.0,Great Northern 12oz Popcorn Packs,This product was recieved on time and in excellent condition. It is also a great tasting product that our family loves and enjoys.
5.0,Fresh Bit-O-Honey,These Bit-O-Honey candies were very fresh and are the same you can buy in the stores (if you can find them now).  Was a very good deal and I will buy them again in the future.
1.0,Gross,Really really.... nasty. Don't recommend wasting your money on this. Oh and when mine came the cheap plastic lid was broken. Thanks Amazon.
5.0,Absolute Ambrosia,"While it may not be the hottest sauce out there, it is certainly the tastiest hot sauce that I have consumed from a bottle. The taste is simply too good to resist. After I was introduced to it by a friend of mine (Thanks, Brent!) I went through a dozen bottles in less than a month.  Goes very well as a dip (I've used it as a dip with cheese dippers from Mazzio's).  Real good stuff."
5.0,ABSOLUTELY GREAT,"taste great, very refreshing, and most important, the ingredients are wholesome and not a chemical factory."
5.0,Extra Tasty Dog Treats,"Both my cat and dog love to eat this! ha ha!  I guess you must think the cat is underfed? Or bored? Ooooh, I agree. So, I joined a cat toilet training group on the internet!!! Hey, it gives the lazy cat SOMETHING to do! what does YOUR cat do all day? I'm vegan, so, I'm used to all the negative comments. My cat does not become trained to do something that he does NOT want to do. It's just not possible. Have you ever tried to train any animal? So, now the cat is Not BORED, nor is he underfed. ha ha, now he gets soft canned cat food or bonito tuna flake treats for accomplishing his Toilet training ""trick"".  Swheat Scoop is flushable... and it works great for Toilet training your cat!  There are photos and I have a video. No, I did NOT use some expensive store bought device. I used an old ice cream bucket! (It has an easy to use handle to remove from the T for human use!)  I love my cat!  And I LOVE this cat litter! If the cat is ever sick or injured, we will go back to this litter! It really is wonderful! The price is amazing! Personally, I think one uses far less of this litter than the really old fashioned clay kind. I have no experience with the new clay kind. 13 yrs ago, I did briefly try the paper litter before this came out though. THis stuff is great!  I have a video on YouTube, I'm not sure what I signed away in the agreement box, so they  may own my video. My name is NLGHTgirl on there.  PS. In all fairness, the curious puppy tried to eat the organic home made local Farmer's market Goat Milk soap as well!! ha ha! I stopped her though!"
5.0,Chocolate gods have called upon this chocolate,This is by far the best tasting chocolate out there. AND to top it off it is filled with delightful caramel! I'd say it worth your time and money to at least give it a try.
5.0,The best chinese noodles.,So happy to find these on amazon - the stores in our area said they could not buy these noodles from their distributers anymore.  Tried other noodles and not even close to the Rose Brand.  My husband and children are very happy that we can have Chinese Noodles for dinner again.
5.0,Fantastic product,"If you love chocolate and fruits, this is the product for you. I have just finished my first bag, and I still can't get over the taste. The candies are bite-size, and (even though I hate using cliches) you simply can't get enough of them. The chocolate doesn't taste bitter, but it's not too sweet either, and the pomegranate enhances the flavor with a slightly sour touch. Overall, just like those commercials say, your mouth will thank you."
5.0,"Very, very good","This is one of the best bagged green teas I have ever tried, and I have tried quite a few. I normally use loose green tea, but have been trying to be more budget-conscious. This tea is a light green the way it's supposed to be, not the oxidized brown. Try it, you will like it!"
5.0,Always Great Coffee.,"Have loved Community Coffee since I first tried it at the Cafe Dumond in the French Quarter. I was online looking for the original blend with chicory, but couldn't find it available in a small enough batch, since I'm only one person and can't use ten bags of coffee.  I saw this flavor and decided to try it . . . it's delicious . . . rich and flavorful with no acidic undertones . . . even better with vanilla flavored creamer.  I'll buy it again."
1.0,don't return this,"Please be aware that Cash & Carry has a huge selection of flavored syrups, for about $4.50/bottle. If you are purchasing from Specialty Restaurant Equipment, be very certain of your order. I bought 2 bottles and after about $11/bottle, plus $13.50 in shipping, I requested to return it, due to a duplicate order. Their response was that after the re-stocking fee and shipping reimbursement, I would have only received a $3 refund. So yes, we will be keeping the syrup and I'm sure it will stay in our pantry for at least 5 years. Our stupid mistake, but I think the vendor needs to reconsider about restocking fees unless they sell to actual businesses."
1.0,Dislike,"Flavor of this product needs to be improved, honey and cinnamon??  Add my own cinnamon helps a little, but the smell when cooking not good also."
5.0,Best Spaghetti,"Many whole grain pastas are difficult to cook, and come out heavy and/or sticky. Not this product. Easy to cook.  Wonderful flavor and texture. Extraordinary. It is to white-flour pasta as whole wheat bread is to white bread: More flavor, texture, and health benefits.  I deviate from the cooking instructions slightly by bringing the water to a boil, lowering the heat, then adding the pasta* (and never return it to a boil). I usually cook for about 14 minutes, which is four minutes longer than the instructions, but at a lower heat.  I add sliced mushrooms to the water while it is cooking. After draining the water off, i add freshly crushed garlic, 2-3 tablespoons of heart-healthy  Nutiva hemp oil , and basil leaf puree (when available) or rehydrated dried basil leaves (when fresh basil is out of season). Add a glass of red wine, some vegetables & sardines, a dab of raw sauerkraut on the served pasta, and this is the perfect meal.  And it's heart-healthy too.  I don't add any salt to the water while it's cooking, but do salt the pasta to taste when served.  Occasionally (rarely) i'll use a little tomato based spaghetti or antipasto sauce, but this pasta really doesn't need it.  Most pasta sauces contain sugar, and more salt than if you just use a salt shaker and salt your pasta to taste.  (Most people don't realize that sugar is metabolized to fat by the liver, and can be bad for the heart.)  Hemp oil has nearly a perfect ratio of Omega-6 to 3.  I've been buying this pasta by the case for years now, at local grocery stores, when it goes on sale.  Just noticed that Amazon carries it.  Amazon's price is as good as most of the sale prices, so will probably start ordering it on-line and save myself the trouble of looking for sales and special ordering it from my local store.  I just bought four cases last week.  _________________________ * I add about 1/10 of the package of pasta at a time, letting the hot water soften it so it'll bend in my pot.  I add each subsequent bunch of pasta in the same manner, but staggered from the other bunches.  Maybe this isn't necessary for this product, but it is a habit -- developed from cooking other whole wheat pastas over the years -- to ensure adequate hydration of all the pasta & prevent clumping.  I then stir the pasta about three or four minutes later, once it has softened up, to ensure none of the bunches have clumped (have never found this pasta to do so, but again habit).  I add the mushrooms about half-way through cooking, and stir once more."
1.0,Oily Beans. Will break your grinder!,The beans arrived good packed. Filled my Vario grinder right away and made some espresso using my QuickMill Andreja. An hour later I felt like get another espresso shot and at that time the grinder stopped working. I looked at the beans in the bag and realized that they were all soaked in oil. I thought it they were just glossy. I had to disassemble the grinder to clean up. The Grinz treatment wouldn't work. Took me a couple of hours to get the work done.  Called amazon for refund.
1.0,Oh you limeys !,It never ceases to amaze me that you Brits eat this horrific dog food-paste.  No wonder you lost the revolutionary war.  It's clear from you eating Marmite and Vegamite that you never deserved those colonies anyway.
1.0,Bad Father's Day Gift,I ordered this Beef Jerky for my dad as a Father's Day gift.  He said it was rock hard...like shoe leather.  I'm sending him a label to return it.  Not sure if it was out dated or just too dry.
1.0,Worked great for a few times,"Thanks to this device i learned how important it is to monitor the temperature while grilling. It work great for several times, but i did need to change the batteries. However after that it stop working completely and I am trying another brand because it is great to be able to monitor the meat you are grilling"
5.0,My Babies Love this food!,"I own 4 very finicky cats, 2 of which are 1/2 Bengals and 1/2 Himalayan's, when I first introduced this to them they devoured it. It is very high quality recognizable food, you can see and smell it's tuna, and it's flaked which they love! Amazon offers it at a great price, I will continue to give them the very best and this is it. I Highly recommend Blue buffalo to any of your pets,"
5.0,Truly Works,I literally drank this 15 mins ago and i can assure you it works. Legit. For about a month i have not been able to go to sleep right away. I would just lay in bed and stare into darkness while my dog looks super comfy sleeping next to me! I am about to go to bed now because i am totallly relaxed and ready for my bed to take me away :)
5.0,...convenience...,"We love this coffee...have it on auto-delivery. Receive a larger bag than we can find in our stores here and it's less expensive. Considering I'm not paying for s/h, it's a win-win for me."
1.0,Puzzle....,How many calories?  How much fat/trans fat?  How much protein?  Full ingredients should be listed - they sound great but nutritional info should be supplied.  Too much of a puzzle to order without knowing....  Petunia
1.0,Zico coconut water is a terrific natural LAXATIVE,"Zico was the sponsoring sports drink for SF Marathon 2011.  I took a free bottle of Zico after I had completed my half-marathon and drank it at home; within several minutes, I had a case of diarrhea.  Then it struck me: I realized that this may be the reason I wanted to take a dump during the race.  After I had run 10 miles at 8 minutes/mile, I was getting dehydrated and picked up 2 cups of Zico coconut water.  Within several minutes, I wanted to take a dump BADLY.  But I forced myself to continue running for the following reasons: I only had 3 miles to go, it's my rule to NEVER stop to use the bathroom during a race, and I had trained several months for the race (training hard on hilly terrain for this particular event).  With me painfully pinching my buttocks the last 3 miles, I slowed down to over 9 minutes/mile while so many people were passing me.  I couldn't sprint the last stretch, I was just trying to hang in there despite the hardship of not letting ""it"" out.  After I finished, I went straight to the portable toilets to relieve myself... which took 15 minutes; this would have been devastating had I used the bathroom during the race, but certainly not as bad had I lost control of my bowels during the race.  I could have finished with an awesome time had I not had wanted to take a dump during the race.  Once I found that Zico was the cause of my diarrhea, I did an internet search on ""coconut water laxative"" and an ABUNDANT number articles of how coconut water is such a great natural LAXATIVE.  The bottom line is this: Zico coconut water will help you ""run"", but in the wrong way.  You'll be putting much more muscle power into your gluttonous maximus than your legs while racing.  Oh, and one more thing... Zico doesn't even taste good.  >:p"
5.0,Shrimp Delight,"Used Dynasty Hot Chili Oil in a Shrimp recipe.  It completed the taste necessary making the meal outstanding. I was not familiar with this brand, but was totally satisfied, and would not hesitate using any other product from Dynasty."
5.0,Very Tasty,These were much thinner than I expected but have a wonderful flavor.  I love them and so does the dog!
1.0,Stale and barely popped,"I was excited to purchase this given popcorn's generally high price.  I received a bag that was noticeably stale and it barely pops.  I'd really like to find a manufacturer where I can purchase good popcorn in bulk.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to purchase this one again."
5.0,Love it!,"I use this vanilla agave in my coffee in the mornings.  It adds just the right amount of sweetener and flavor without being overpowering and there is no aftertaste.  While I have learned that it is more processed than the makers would have you realize (processed agave nectar isn't exactly what I would call a whole food), it is a great alternative to using flavored creamers with corn syrup solids in them!  Just be aware of what you're consuming."
5.0,My cats like the Shreds varieties,"We have a few cats, so finding flavors they agree on was hard at first.  In this shreds or shredded type, almost all the flavors have met with their approval.  We try to feed a variety of flavors in various cat foods to keep things interesting, but every morning we offer one can of shreds because it's always eaten by someone who preferred it to another offering. Of all the flavors, the two that have become the staples in our house are the chicken/salmon and the whitefish/tuna.  The others are just fine too, but these are the favorites.  Even our one cat who prefers dry foods likes these, and really digs lapping up the gravy.  This is available at our supermarket for about 45 cents a can, and we'd love to see it on Subscribe and Save at a more competative price than the current almost 80 cents a can offered.  If the S&S price were closer, we'd sign up for it."
1.0,Misrepresentation o product,Assumed it would be a mi of flavors and regular coffee. All fruity flavored coffee. Not good. And they would not allow me to exchange it. So now I'm stuck with $40 worth of coffee that I'm not going to drink.
5.0,Tastes Great,"Please note that I am not evaluating the nutritional value of this, nor am I commenting on the amount of sodium. I did  not read that part of the label and assume that it is within the norm for products of this type. That being said, the entire family REALLY liked this.  No one flavor was overpowering (something I feared as I have never been a fan of Velveeta cheese itself). You do have to add the chicken to it ... why I didn't think of that I do not know; it's kind of obvious ... but everything cooks up quickly, and as I said, everyone loves it. We will be buying more of this."
1.0,Cans arrived dented and unsuable,I do like the taste of this soup as I have purchased this in the past at the grocery store. I haven't been able to find it so when I saw this offered on Amazon I ordered several cases. To my disappointment all but 3 of the cans were severly dented and one was actually leaking. Amazon immediately sent replacements but sadly they arrived in the same condition. I'm not sure if this problem originated in the warehouse or was the result of poor packaging and shipping. The only reason I gave this one star is because of the superior customer service I received from Amazon. I will try this item again at a later date to see if they have corrected the problem.
5.0,a very good decaffeinated coffee,"I am on a course of chemotherapy; and I am therefore not allowed to drink regular coffee because it has caffeine. I tried Nescafe Taster's Choice decaf coffee and I was very much in love!  This coffee can be made in any coffee pot or coffee maker. The coffee is consistently tasteful.  You probably should refrigerate the container after you open it; but I have left it outside on my kitchen countertop and the coffee I make with this still tastes fine. If you're lucky enough to catch a great sale on this terrific decaffeinated coffee I would suggest that you stock up. You can even put the unused containers in your freezer for up to several months, maybe even a year. It will stay fresh and taste every bit as good after you let it defrost.  All in all, Nescafe Taster's Choice is an excellent decaffeinated coffee and it remains extremely popular. Buy some and try it today--you won't be disappointed!"
1.0,Very disapponted,"There are 2 unused 16 oz. bags of this coffee waiting for someone to use them; I am very disappointed in this coffee, because it is not only weak, it is tasteless. Whatever virtues others claim, I am canceling my order for repeated shipments. I've drunk decaffeinated Sumatra coffee for years and was seeking one with a reduced acid taste, but this has no taste at all. Very disappointed."
5.0,Great taste,"These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess."
5.0,Made in Texas and it is simple goodness to spice up recipes,"This is as easy to use as regular taco seasoning packets but more cost effective if taco seasoning is one of your staples. The ingredients are comino and other spices, salt and garlic and it comes in shaker style bottle that is resealable. It is great to use in tacos, enchiladas, and dips. It is flavorful without being too spicy and even kids enjoy it. It is made in Texas where Mexican food is a staple in many households and this will jump start your recipes for those quick dinner nights after a long day at work."
5.0,I love these for my small dog.,We have a Mini Schnauzer who loves these things.  These are great for dogs in which a full pigs ear is too much for one sitting.  I use these as a treat for my dog whenever I am going somewhere and she will have to stay in her cage.  These are always gone by the time I get home and she gets right in her cage without a fight because she knows she will get one.  I think these would be a huge waste for a medium to large dog as they would finish them so quickly.
5.0,My fave GF chip!  Delicious!,"LOVE these chips.  I think there are so many GF baked goods (be they less than exciting rice chips, heavy breads, grainy cakes, etc.) that just fall short of taste and texture.  I am knocked out by how crisp and tasty these are!  They are much like a popular orange triangular chip but better, even ""fresher"" tasting.  If I don't take a serving and put the bag away first, I'm very likely to mow through it in one sitting.  Products like these make me feel like I'm not sacrificing anything at all for the sake of going GF."
1.0,Tastes like generic Margarita mix,"Well, it's green. Sort of an electric tree frog green. And opaque. In fact, it looks a lot like bottled margarita mix. And that's pretty much what it tastes like. If you like the taste of low cal margarita mix, you'll probably enjoy this mocktail mix. If you prefer your margaritas with a little more crisp lime-y bite, give this one a pass. I tried it mixed with water and served over ice. Maybe try mixing it with ice in a blender? I'm too lazy to get the blender out for a quick drink and always drink my Margaritas on the rocks.  I have also tried the Target 5-calorie Market Pantry on-the-go drink mix in Lime Margarita. It's more transparent (which seems less disturbing somehow) and comes with recipe enhancers right on the box. For example, add fresh lime juice. There's even a recipe for a full fledged Margarita.  In comparison, I found the Crystal Light lacking: too artificial tasting with a less than appealing color.  PS. For my second batch, I added 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice. I thought that helped, but the only way my husband would drink it was if he dumped in a bunch of grenadine. Also, when the pitcher was empty I noticed that the product left behind a noticeable chalky white substance on the bottom of the pitcher. We won't be finishing off the rest of the mix."
5.0,Great Pancakes & Cookies,"This is a great gluten-free substitute for regular flour.  It has a slight nutty flavor which is a wonderful addition to pancakes, cookies and quick breads.  (I love adding bananas & nuts to pancakes anyway.) Originally, I signed up for the 6 month subscription and save option, but I'll need to change it to every 3 months because we are using this product in place of regular flour for many different recipes."
1.0,"False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!","I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like ""Beneful"" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, but didn't seem to enjoy it as much as their previous brand. After reading the ingredients of Beneful, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. I try to avoid corn in all pet foods, and as a main ingredients is just ridiculous. Dogs are meant to eat real meat, they are carnivores. Basically dogs cannot fully digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging when they are not present in the food; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.  I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness."
1.0,Havent received,"The product (Betty Crocker Hamburger Helper, Italian, Cheesy Italian Shells 6.1-Ounce (Pack of 6 ) (Purchased on August 26, 2012)is yet to be received.  Its been over a month and I still dont have it although I had been notified that it shipped in August."
1.0,Terrible!,"I bought these because I had decided I wanted to eat, and even snack, healthier.  These had so many good reviews, so I decided to try them.  I admit, it was a big mistake to order a whole stupid case without trying them first.  When I opened them, they looked totally unappetizing and then I tasted them......it tasted just like a rice cake/styrofoam with salt on it.  They also have a very unusual texture.  The combination of taste and texture was very disappointing.  My teenage daughter tried them and felt the same way - not even the dog would eat them.  We tried them with a variety of dips and couldn't come up with a tolerable way to choke them down.  Luckily, I have a niece that is newly vegetarian, hungry all the time, and she took these off my hands.  I am still out $25 for buying the case of these to begin with...what a waste!"
1.0,greens are not growing,"My package arrived quickly, but was not packaged well.  (Squished)  The salad greens, which I started 4 weeks ago, began to grow and then whithered and are now dying.  This is the 4th kit I have done and I have checked everything on my end.  I know I did everything right and I never had a problem with any others.  (2 bought at stores and 1 bought on line/different vender) Not sure what the problem is, but I'm guessing the kit was old.  I guess that is my fault for not checking the date and have since thrown the box away.  Will be more careful in the future buying kits."
1.0,Really tough to eat,"From the few reviews I read, I expected tender jerky that would melt in my mouth. Instead what I got was rough jerky that actually hurt my jaw to eat more than 2-3 pieces. Would not recommend this product."
1.0,Stale wlanuts,"I am very disappointed to receive these walnuts, in poor packaging, and with stale taste.. they are not fresh. Suggest buyers to think twice before getting these."
5.0,Great flavor and organic too,"These dried onion flakes have a flavor and aroma that's a combination of fresh and slightly toasted, with just a hint of sweetness. In short, they're great.  And 16 ounces of dried onion is quite a lot of onion. Keep it in airtight containers to keep the flavor fresh for a long time."
5.0,"Yummy little cookies, nice small portions","These tasted just like the little Famous Amos cookies, and I was glad to see they were made out of actual food & not a bunch of chemicals (not that the Famous Amos cookies are necessarily fake food--I don't know offhand). I do like that the portion size was small, though the packaging is a little excessive for what you're getting--but individual portions always are. But you can always recycle the Mylar bags & feel less guilty about using excess packaging to curb your gluttony."
5.0,Awesome Chives!,It's so nice to be able to find large canisters of chives again!  The small canisters in the stores cost a small fortune.  This is a fantastic deal and the taste is great too!
1.0,Oreo Crumbs,Received my order promptly but when I opened all 4 packages I discovered that the cookies were all beat to heck! Looks like the NFL used them for football practice! They were also slightly stale! Remind me never to buy cookies online!
1.0,outragious price!!,$36 for 32 packs. Are you Kidding? The first packs I bought at BJS cost about $7.00 for 32 packs. You can often get a 7 pack at Target on sale for $2.  Love the almonds and still eat them every day but No Thanks!
5.0,Love the Nantucket!,This is another K-Cup flavor we have on automatic delivery. It has a nice flavor with no bitterness.  I usually drink it in the morning and find it to be very pleasant.
1.0,Made in China,"For some reason, I thought they were from Thailand, but I was wrong.  They are from China.  I don't feed my child food products from China.  I don't trust them to not use poisons, because we know they will, if it saves a buck.  I will not order again."
5.0,Cats have loved this since it first became available!,"Both of my cats love this cat food, they eat their plates clean.  I also give them dry food to help keep their teeth clean.  I buy nearly all of the 5.5 oz Natural Value cat foods and this past Monday showed all the labels to my vet. He said it is a great food and my cats, both in for checkups, look wonderful.  One is eleven and the other is seven and they are totally indoor RV cats, beautiful coats, bright eyes, perfect weight.  Their teeth are also in beautiful shape, meaning no expensive cleaning bills."
1.0,Missing pack,I only received 4 packs (there should have been 5 pack) of gum.  The Raspberry pack of gum is missing.
1.0,WARNING: amazon will powder pecans,"These are tasty POWDERED pecans.  Amazon fulfillment warehouses apparently have an even worse policy: ZERO PADDING in a box.  To experience the ""quality"" of pecans I received place your pecans in a paint shaker for an hour."
5.0,Just as advertised.,"The dried mushrooms, once rehydrated, are delicious in a variety of recipes. Now that I've tried this product, I will keep it in my pantry."
1.0,So Disappointed,"I had been trying to find these for quite awhile, and I was so excited to find them here on Amazon.  What a mistake....I was so disappointed to find that they are horribly stale!!! A bag doesn't normally last too long when they are fresh, but I can't even eat these.  Save your money."
1.0,"Not sure these are safe, big chunks break off","I have a number of Nylabones that are natural in color and 5 years old.  Our dog died 4 years ago and we kept the misc supplies.  Now we have a new lab and she loves the natural ones, which she basically wears down slowly. We also had some white nylabones that hadn't been used and our lab almost eats them.  First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces.  Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth.  It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily. We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones. Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.  I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.  I did not buy Nylabones here.  I'm searching for a source of the good ones that don't break into large chunks.  I asked for advice at the Nylabone site but have not heard from them."
5.0,Tasty!!,"Both my husband and 3 year old have a gluten allergy. We have tried other products and found that these taste the best for animal crackers. It's not grainy or taste funny. Like another reviewer stated, it taste more like a butter cookie. Yummy! Not sure why anyone would rate it one star. I understand personal preference to taste and texture like one reviewer but the other reviewer just seemed to be on a rant. We have been pleased with this product and highly recommend it to others who are looking for a tasty gluten free snack."
1.0,tastes like plastic,"This ""beef jerky"" does not taste like beef jerky at all. It has little flavor, and the flavor it does have tastes like chemicals. Avoid! I would not eat this if it were for free."
5.0,Yummo!,"Coffee Bean Direct Irish Cream..... ROCKS!  Save money and use the subscribe and save option, you will not want to run out!"
5.0,Delicious!,"I love this flavor of K-cup.  A little spice is fantastic!  WOW did the price go up!  I only paid $12 for mine.  I would personally look elsewhere before I would pay the $29 they are asking now.  Check the Keurig website or Bed, Bath and Beyond.  A great flavored coffee, I got 2 boxes!"
5.0,Love Dark Chocolate Dreams!,"Based on reviews, I decided to try Dark Chocolate Dreams, mainly because I love dark chocolate.  Generally, I eat regular peanut butter a few times a month, certainly not every week.  However, I eat this almost every day, usually on toast in the morning, but it's great for a snack also.  I signed up for the regular shipments which give a price break.  If you like dark chocolate, I definitely recommend this!"
5.0,Nutive Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil,"I wanted to try this product for mental clarity in my golden years.  I was worried what it would taste like and whether I could use it.  Well -- this is delicious!  I use it instead of butter, especially on toast and hot cereals.  It doesn't make every single thing taste like coconut, it just makes them taste good.  I'll always use it.  Thanks, Amazon.com."
5.0,Yankee enjoys the seafood flavor,I was amazed how tasty this soup is.  I make many soups and for an inexpense product when at work in a rush Yummy Yummy... I have gone back to buy as many cans as I could get my hands on... I love it!  Good Job. Yankee in Palm Beach County Fl
1.0,Feel the Warmth,"I love General Foods International Chai Tea Latte and drink a lot of it.  It warms me up on cold winter days.  You can even put ice cubes in it and drink it as a cold drink in the summer.  Buying Chai Tea at the grocery store gets very expensive the way I drink it.  Buying Chai Tea in bulk helps me save money.  If I did not buy my Chai Tea from Amazon.com, I probably would have stopped drinking it as much or not at all.  Thanks Amazon.dot come for stocking ths wonderful product.  General Foods International Chai Tea Latte, 32-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) "
5.0,Delicious,"I ordered this product because I didn't see it locally, and I have a very easy recipe that calls for adding tuna to caponata with some garlic, parsley, lemon juice and crushed red pepper and serving it over pasta. The caponata makes the quick dish very special. The cans are tiny so a case doesn't take up much room and because it keeps so long, it makes sense to have so many on hand. Very pleased with the purchase."
1.0,not sure if it was from this food,"based on reviews and ingredients ordered this food to change out with wellness food, my 9 yr old cat developed stones in his bladder. he underwent surgery this past Tuesday. It will be a long touph recovery for him.  he never had this problem until I mixed this food into his diet.  it could be a coincidence but I think it is strange this happened about 1 month after starting this food. His stones have been sent to the lab to see what caused them from his diet.  Anyhow the food does look good, just might not have worked for my little guy."
5.0,rice treats,very good my son loves to take them to school as snacks  i will buy them again there great for in between meals snacks
5.0,Great product,Organic food pouches are wonderful. They are easy to carry and to eat (children can manipulate them on their own as soon as they can hold things with both hands). My child enjoyed Ella's kitchen pouches a lot till she was almost 18 months old.  She seemd to like apples+bananas the best.
1.0,bug in products,Went to use and found that there were bugs flying around the container!  Will not buy again ever!  Contacted Marshall's two week ago and not a return call or email.  will never purchase again ever!
1.0,I wanted to like it....,"I gave up the diet coke (aspartame/sucralose)and needed to find something i enjoy drinking. This had great reviews, so i couldn't wait to try it. What a waste of money!! I would rather drink plain water. Not sweet at all. Don't know how i will be able to choke down 23 more packs of this."
5.0,MMMMmmmm Kool Aid!,"Okay, so there's no juice here, and it's basically just flavored sugar water, but Kool-Aid is great for pepping up water and making it taste better than just plain old tap water. This flavor is Peach Mango, and it's heavier on the peach than the mango, making it a refreshing, sweet drink. I like to mix the finished product with real juice (whatever is on hand) to make the juice stretch further without having a watered-down flavor.  This product is nothing new in the world of Kool-Aid, of course. It's sugar-sweetened. No bad-tasting aspartame, sucralose/Splenda, or other artificial sweeteners in here, thank goodness! Just good old sugar.  You can't go wrong with Kool-Aid, especially if you use it as a way to make real juice last longer. It's certainly better than loading yourself or your kids down with high fructose corn syrup!  Worth the price. Bring your own water."
5.0,Flaky pie crust,"Learning to bake without gluten is a new process for me. I thought that working with the dough seemed more like making a cookie dough than rolling out a pie crust. Without gluten it lacks the elasticity that I am used to. Once I got the knack of working with the dough and doing some patching I was very pleased with the results. The flavor and appearance of the pie were not distinguishable from a crust made with wheat flour. In fact, the crust was flaky and even better than many pie crusts that I have eaten."
5.0,Our dog loves this stuff.,"Our dog was not eating, we tried Iams and some other dog foods with little to no luck. Did some research and realized that most dog food out there is not real good for our four legged friends, found some good ones. Bought some of Taste of the Wild and he just loves it!"
1.0,Worst Merchant on Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Do not order from Marshall Creek Spices...  It takes forever to receive the merchandise and then comes with postage due!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Terrible service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0,"Good, clean oil!","I was so excited to get such high-quality oil in a pack of three! I can use it for oil pulling, cooking, massage, and as a carrier oil for washing my face. Easy to pour, no-nonsense packaging. I'm satisfied!"
1.0,Not the toy for my dog,"I bought this for my lab thinking it would be a fun challenging toy for him, but he has never even touched it.  I put treats in it and he wouldn't go near this toy! I tried to give it to my mom's labs and they didn't want anything to do with it either."
5.0,so delicious!,"This tea is perfect for that afternoon cup or evening drink when you just need to unwind.  The blackberry vanilla taste is strong and sweet, but delicious!  It really surprised me how much I liked this.  Be warned - if you don't like fruity, you probably won't like this, but I'm a big Crystal Light drinker ;-)"
1.0,Disappointing,"I bought a huge bottle of this from GFS in order to have it on hand for cooking. Big mistake, this stuff is more savory than sweet and sour. We are not fans. I will use it up, but it sure won't be eagerly!"
1.0,Dogs were allergic!,"I was really hoping that these would be a great treat for my dogs (both Yorkies).  Unfortunately, after give each half a stick, they both broke out with allergic reactions.  One Yorkie had redness and swelling on his upper eyelid and under one paw.  The other had a red swollen bump on his tail and they were both itching and scratching.  I obviously didn't given them any more of these treats and some benadryl to calm down the reaction they had."
5.0,Good Price,"If you love Lupini Beans, this is the way to buy them. Delicious as an appetizer with some crusty bread and a glass of wine."
1.0,AWFUL,"I'm so sorry I bought this.  I've purchased this product in stores and it has been great; but what I purchased on line was old and rancid...I had to throw out $90 worth of junk.  I'm beyond disappointed, it smelled, and my dog wouldn't even eat it.  LLM"
1.0,Ghastly,"I have been to Nicaragua, and I have had real, organic coffee there (some of the best was by workers in the vicinity of Esteli.  Real Nicaraguan coffee is earthy and fragrant with low bitterness and acidity.  One can thus jack up the quantity of coffee per pot and get as intense a flavor as one wants with no downside.  I purchased this product with great excitement after the bags of coffee I took from Nicaragua were finished.  I was dreadfully disappointed.  Indeed, I would say that this is, as close as I can tell, anti-Nicaraguan coffee.  It has none of that earthiness and fragrance but plenty of bitterness and acidity.  It is completely, in other words, lacking in character.  Indeed, I think this is closer to Folgers than to gourmet coffee of any kind.  I am aware that negative reviews tend to get panned.  But I want to make clear that I sought, as was given, a refund for this ""unrefundable"" product.  I said at the time that I would be posting a negative review to steer others away from this product.  I will try with some other brand of Nicaraguan coffee in the future.  Maybe I'll just pre-pay to have the real stuff sent to me from that country."
5.0,the best!,"These lollipops are the best you can find! I can't remember when I had a lollipop the last time (since they are a pure chemistry!!! yuck!) until I found these wonderful organic, all-natural lollipops that my son, my husband and I love, love, love! 5 stars!"
1.0,Great Coffee - Bad Packaging,"I don't usually write reviews, but was compelled to advise everyone. I have purchased two different flavors. The first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released. There were about 10 k-cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere. To Amazon's credit they issued a refund. The second box was delivered with no damage to the k-cups. So I have brewed about 20 of the k-cups and around 50-60% of them are faulty. I never have had this issue with other brands. Either I get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle, when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup, coffee maker or counter. I then have to discard that cup and brew another, such a waste.  I do think the coffee is great and flavorful. I would purchase again if they would fix the issues with the k-cups. Until then I can not recommend anyone purchase this product."
1.0,"Nasty consistency, a lot of money for...?","This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash. As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.  The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.  Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.  It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested - it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.  I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again."
1.0,Dog food,My husband and I both think this looks like and tastes like dog food. We were very sad and couldn't even eat more than one nugget size bite. We wish we had a way to return it! What a waste of money.
5.0,Excellent! exactly what I wanted,"The cup and the Bombilla showed up within a few days, I cured it over night bam! good to go. My Yerba Mate Store sent a hand written thank you along with a lot of free samples. I would definitely recommend the store and the product."
1.0,Everlasting can be very short,"I  was pleased to,read about these treats and thought what a good time my dog would have with them. It lasted about 10 minutes. I think there is something amiss with the  product description"
1.0,"Horrible, just Horrible",This is horrible! The crap Foldger's substitute you get at Motel 6 is better. I wasted money on this one because it is so bad that I would feel bad about giving it away.
1.0,Item not as pictured,"Product was fine but it's not as pictured, it comes in a plastic bag and its tiny little bags of gummi bears."
1.0,Disgusting!!,"What a terrible dinner.  I just wasted 2 pounds of ground chuck from the butcher shop and a box of organic quinoa pasta.  If you would like to experience the taste of this sauce, there's no need to buy it.  Just take the bottle of lemon juice from the refrigerator and drink straight from the bottle!!  I make my own homemade sauce from fresh tomatoes often.  This sauce doesn't taste like there is even tomatoes in it.  As far as I'm concerned between the beef, pasta and fresh sauted veggies I put into it, it ended up wasting me around $20 and forced my family to quick scrounge for a fast dinner.  It hardly tasted like food!!"
1.0,agree[- it's not French Roast,"I'm not saying it's poor quality coffee.  What I AM saying is that it's not French Roast.  It's not double roasted.  The beans are not double-roasted, dark and somewhat oily.  There are at least a half dozen brands that are close to or nearly French Roast.  Another coffee available from Amazon.com, San Francisco Bay French Roast whole bean coffee, is what I prefer."
1.0,Gluten-Free Bandwagon,"I totally agree with those expressing their requests for more ingredient information.  There are so many gluten-free products on the market now because it's ""popular"" to do so and bucks can be made.  I recently opened a wheat-free, gluten-free bakery because most commercial products take short-cuts and include ingredients which should not be combined, even if they are wheat-free & gluten-free.  Also, most commercial gluten-free products contain a ton of sugar.  Please be very selective and pay attention to how your body responds - you can learn to do that even before you eat something."
5.0,A new family favorite!,"I originally bought this coconut oil for making cold process soap. But, after reading more in depth about the many ways it can be used, I started using it as a deep conditioner for my hair. Then we ran out of butter and used the coconut oil instead...it made the best snickerdoodles! Even on pancakes it's fabulous."
1.0,Not two pounds,When you order a two-pound box you expect two pounds.  This is only 25 ounces. You should provide more product or explain up front that in your world 2 pounds is only 25 ounces.  Packaging doesn't count in my opinion.
1.0,Very VERY Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I am very disappointed by this product. I sent these to my mother-in-law as a birthday gift, and while she was very happy to receive it, she also politely told me that the chocolate-covered pretzels were not fresh. They had already spoiled, with the chocolate having bloomed (i.e. has that whitish powdery look and is grainy) and the pretzels themselves tasting very stale. To call this box ""gourmet"" is just an egregious lie - all items are basically purchased in bulk items that you usually get at the candy isle in a cheap drugstore. I am very angry about this! Obviously these boxes have sat for a LONG time and no one cares enough to take a look and see that the chocolate isn't looking fresh. I would not recommend anyone to buy these as a gift or even for themselves."
1.0,Not good,"I love the apple and pear products, and my favorite fruit is the mandarin orange, so I assumed I would like these. Wrong! One bite and I almost spit it out. I talked myself into thinking that maybe it's an acquired taste, but finishing my first pouch is turning out to be way too difficult. What a waste of money!! I can't even hand these out to people because I'm sue that no one will want them. Yes, they're that bad. I hope I can use these to make some sort of citrus tea or other drink, or maybe even toss in my salads. I don't know, we'll see. I'm just really disappointed."
1.0,Bully sticks,"I received those bully sticks today and they are the worst bully sticks I have ever received, greasy, thin, smelly. I threw most of them out. I would not recommend those to anybody.  Will not buy again."
5.0,Delish!,"I'm probably one of those weirdos who can tolerate a LOT of heat, so, this review is coming from someone who loves her hot stuff.  Anyhoo, this is definitely HOT but not anything near scorching hot where you can't appreciate the flavor of the pepper itself. This cayenne has a nice sweet fruitiness coupled with the heat which I really dig.  For those of you who are not used to a lot of heat, go easy on yourself at first and gradually work up to more or you might be visiting the toilet in a tumultuous rush.  My only disappointment is that this is not organic. Why is it that all of the super hot cayenne is non-organic? Is it because the peppers are so hot that they repel bugs naturally and are already 'organic' by proxy of their natural repellent factor? LOL"
5.0,Starbucks Pike Place Roast,"Everything it claims to be and the kind of coffee that will likely please the majority of coffee drinkers. I find that a coffee press is the best way to appreciate freshly ground quality coffee beans, but this is very good using an automatic drip maker as well. It has a well rounded full flavor, nice aroma and without being too acidic. The shipping was very prompt arriving two days earlier than the earliest estimated time of arrival. It came well packaged and the beans were of top quality freshness. ""I only wish that I could afford it more often."" I highly recommend giving this one a try."
5.0,Great Deep Dish Pizza Crust!,"I've been dying to have pizza again since I recently went gluten free, so I picked this up at a local store to give it a shot. Wow, was it amazing!! This mix made the heaviest deep dish pizza I've ever seen! I haven't even been able to make a pizza crust like this with regular flour. We loaded the dough with cheese, sauce, and pepperoni, and we're still trying to finish the pizza, days later. It doesn't take exactly like ""regular"" pizza crust, but I almost can't remember the taste of ""regular"" pizza crust after eating this, it was so good!  Thank you, Gluten-Free Pantry, for giving us such a great pizza crust!"
1.0,Awful,"The quality of this rice is terrible.  You have to pick out all the black old pieces and the rice hulls.  How sad that some companies, like this one, make/sell such lousy products."
5.0,Love These Veggie Hot Dogs!,"I was raised on these, and now my kids love them!  We usually just heat them in the microwave.  They are good with soup, spaghetti-o's, dinner, lunch, etc.  I like them cold, sliced on a salad or in a sandwitch with lettuce, tomato, etc.  There is no meat in these, so you don't need to cook them.  They can also be used in most ways hot dogs can, except I don't think these taste that good boiled.  You can grill them, cut them into baked beans, roll them in Pillsbury Crescent rolls and bake, etc.  They are very versatile and a good source of protein that my kids will eat!"
5.0,OOOOoooooh!! ...SO Sweet!,"We waited over a year for this product to emerge on Amazon and made sure we were notified when it did. YUM! We had it shipped all the way to Kauai were we USED to find it in the stores. Hot, light, fluffy Hawaiian sweet bread splashed with soft, sweet butter (or Smart Balance)... what a wonderfully delicious way to wake up in the morning. You can set the timer for your bread maker to finish just before you get up... Oooh-la-la! breakfast in bed.... ya know what I mean?"
5.0,Relax,"Marley's Mellow Mood green tea with honey tastes ok, but it does work wonders for relaxation. I keep one in the fridge for times of insomnia. It helps greatly by increasing relaxation so I can fall asleep."
5.0,BEST HOT COCOA YET,This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite. I would give these try for sure if you are looking for some hot cocoa K-cups. All the other selections for hot cocoa that I have tried were just okay tasting. These are AMAZING!!!! LOVE THEM! I will order these for sure again!
1.0,Made my cat sick,"My cat had a very bad reaction to these treats. He loved them, but they were like an extreme laxative. It took me a while to track down his problem. Maybe it was the chlorophyll, I don't know, but if your cat has a sensitive stomach, I'd be careful with these particular treats."
1.0,A bunch of packets in a brown paper bag.,"I ordered this thinking it would come properly packaged. What I got was a bunch of coffee single serves in a brown paper bag. I can't believe Amazon would sell something packaged like this. You wouldn't buy this if it was at a yard sell. Very, very disappointed in what I got."
5.0,Not quite like Dr Pepper,"I have been buying Zevia for a while now and finally came upon it on amazon, way better deal on here than at the store. Dr. Zevia is like Dr. Pepper and Cherry Coke combined, which actually tastes wonderful. I highly recommend this soda but if you are a Dr. Pepper addict you might find it slightly lacking."
5.0,Excellent Product - Excellent Value,"I recently purchased these pods for the first time because the Senseo brands ones I had been buying for almost a year were out-of-stock. I am very pleased with Baronet's dark roast and recommend it to anyone who enjoys  bold and fully flavored coffee. The pods are very full - so full that I have to use the double-pod holder on my Senseo maker to accommodate a single Baronet pod. The pods come in a dispensing box, and each pod is individually foil wrapped. This is a big improvement on the Senseo brand pods, which come loose in a foil pouch and deteriorate once exposed to the air after the pouch is first opened.  Baronet pods are an excellent product, better than the Senseo ones I had been using, and I highly recommend them."
1.0,Gas and diarrhea,"I fed this to my 9 week old puppy and she loves them. However, a couple hours later she burped and wreaked of garlic. Then followed by loose stool. I stopped giving her these treats for a few days and the symptoms disappeared. Then tonight I gave her a couple of these treats again and same thing happened. This time after the loose stool, I think her stomach was still upset and she wanted to go to sleep but kept fidgeting and wimpering. I sat with her rubbing her stomach. Eventually she fell asleep. Well, I'm never buying this brand again."
5.0,Great tea,"This tea has a really different taste from anything else, all other green teas will taste old compared to this. The pack it came in lasted me for about 3 months, drinking a couple of cups a week, not daily. I really recommend this if you're intrested in quality tea."
5.0,Yum!,"Just purchased these at my local grocery store and would recommend them. The flavor is really unique almost reminds me of a seasoning you'd put on grilled chicken. They show a red pepper on the box which led me to think maybe they'd have a spiciness to them...not at all. If you can get them at your local store, i'd buy them there ( bought a couple at 2.99 a box.)Love anything pepperidge farm and definitely suggest these crackers to eat anytime!"
5.0,The best tea ever......,"While traveling in Ireland 12 years ago I discovered this excellent tea.  My European husband and I both love it......his with milk, mine with a little sugar.  I was so glad to find it on Amazon and order it regularly as needed."
1.0,bitter coffee,wow i cannot get anybody at home to drink this coffee.  getting ready to pitch it.  or maybe i should put it on ebay?  hahaha
1.0,Misrepresented product,"The ad plainly says 16oz can ""pack of 3"". I ordered ""2"", so that should have been 6 cans...... I only received two! I have thought about calling the Better Business Bureau and complaining. It's a matter of principle!  It is a good mix, but I won't be ordering from them again."
5.0,"Not quite as good as regular batter, but its good enough!","Considering that its low carb, its pretty tasty.  It coated well, stood up to frying well, and did OK in the oven (a little soggy on the bottom for a few pieces).  Be aware that there is a little bit of an aftertaste, as with almost all low carb products, but in this product its not overwhelming (remember: individual tastes may vary!), and if you use a lot of hot sauce on your chicken like I do, you don't notice it at all, hah.  It also works well for regular fried chicken with a bit of salt, pepper and paprika added.  I will be buying this product again (and again).  Note: if you are looking for a frying batter coating, use this from Dixie - do NOT buy Dixie's ""Plain bread crumbs"", it had a really bad sour taste and aftertaste.  This stuff is good.  I now can put home made Hot Wings and breaded chicken breast tenders back on my diet and enjoy a favorite food without blasting my blood sugar and still keep my diet low carb -- Thanks Dixie, and pass me the hot wing sauce!"
1.0,Not impressed.,"Old, dry beans.  I was not impressed.  After hearing people rave about these beans, I was looking forward to my first cup of espresso using them.  What a let down."
1.0,First Time Really Disappointed,"I was enticed by the cool design - less trash is good. The price obviously was also very enticing. When the coffee arrived, I carefully transferred the pods to a plastic ziploc bag. So far, so good. I then proceeded to brew my first cup - all excited to have found something wonderful. Well, the excitement ceased when the cup produced was pure black liquid with a flavor that was not pleasing to my palate - at all. Maybe if you like bitterness in a coffee without the pleasantness of a well-rounded rich coffee, then this is for you. I found it not an experience to be repeated. I tried to like this coffee, but will go back to another brand. Sorry San Francisco Bay Coffee company - I really tried. The decaf French Roast was even less likable..."
5.0,The ONLY Packaged Coconut Water Worth Tasting,"A little while back I was given a box of 12 whole young coconuts to enjoy. After a bit of practice I perfected the art of chopping the top open with a butcher's cleaver to insert a straw and suckle the sweet nectar contained within. As much fun as that was, whole coconuts take up too much space in the fridge and I'm always concerned that they must use some kind of chemicals on them to keep the ""fresh"" from their home in Thailand to my grocer's refrigerators.  Without knowing really anything about the whole packaged coconut water game, I assumed very incorrectly that I could just select a container of any random brand off a store shelf and it would taste as immaculate as the perfect juice from a fresh-cracked coconut.  I could not have been more wrong.  I first tried Vita Coco because it seems to be the most common brand really everywhere. It was even at Costco, so I bought their handy 12-pack expecting to delight in the treat. I got the tetra-pak all nice and chilled before taking my first sip, and when I did I was furious. ""How can they call this coconut water?!"" I exclaimed. It tastes kind of like diluted, sour, used, soapy dish water that leaves a funky wang in your mouth and does nothing toward quenching your thirst. It seemed to make me thirsty for some plain old water. Yuck!  At first I thought maybe I got a bad batch, but then I headed online for some reviews and I found I was not alone. How unfortunate. However, I also found lots of reviews of some other brands that people seemed to love. ""Yay! There's still hope!"" I thought to myself.  The confusing part was that for every brand for which I found good reviews, there seemed to be countless other reviewers disgusted by each one. I read a review comparing Zico, O.N.E., and Vita Coco to one another, and it ranked the former two far above the latter. I went ahead and bought a bottle of each Zico and O.N.E. and determined they are swill, especially Zico, which tastes like tap water that was spit into by someone who just ate a rotten coconut.  I continued reading reviews and found several stating that Amy & Brian is really great, but that some find it overly sweet. I am not a fan of sugary sweetness in my coconut water, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. The results? Meh. It's really not sweet at all, and although there is more flavor, it still doesn't taste like fresh coconut water. Yet another review stated that Nature Factor was a close second behind Amy & Brian, so I gave that a shot. It's definitely a little worse than Amy & Brian, but it is very similar and doesn't taste like a real coconut.  I was just about to give up hope when one of the small ~9 oz. bottles with pulp of Taste Nirvana landed in my hands. I presumed it was going to be more funky wang sauce, but I took my first sip and whoa-ho-hoooo what have we here? A miracle in a bottle? A fresh coconut shaped like a bottle? Nay, it was really bottle coconut water that really tasted like coconut water! In fact it tastes even better than fresh coconut water because there's a subtle sort of butteriness to the flavor. I thought it had to be a fluke, but I took another sip (and about finished the bottle), and every drop went down as unbelievably delicious as the first.  I immediately hopped onto Amazon and started a subscribe & save subscription. My first case of these 16 oz. tall cans sans pulp arrived today and after a quick 1 hour in the freezer, I just tried my first can. Son of a biscuit, it almost brings me to tears to tell you this, but it was possibly the best canned beverage I've ever guzzled. I tried so hard to make it last, but I almost chugged the darned thing because the deliciousness was so unstoppable.  In short, if you're looking for some good coconut water and don't want to deal with cleaving real coconuts, save yourself a lot of time and heartache; don't try anything but Taste Nirvana. You won't regret it. I just wish I had someone else giving me this advice at the start of my misadventures in coco-hunting."
1.0,Too expensive & made my dog puke!,"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.  I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.  I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.  I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."
5.0,Great instant coffee,This is great to have around for visitors who drink caffeinated coffee. Keep it in the fridge and you're always ready to serve a good cup of caffeine....one by one.
5.0,Almost complete!,"After I added a few ingrediants, (Canned Crab & Shrimp) it was actually pretty good! Little soupy even though it has rice already in it!"
5.0,cook your best,Product is sensational....especially on pork chops.  Gourmet flavors.  It is what separates your cooking from all others on the planet!
5.0,Happy little dog!,"For such a little dog, my bichon is a powerful chewer and like all dogs, he HAS to chew! He rips through most man-made chew products made for dogs or just plain ignores them. This product may smell bad to humans, but it is smells wonderful to my dog and my dog loves it! He does not chew up any of my things because he has his bully sticks (as well as carrots and yams)."
1.0,jet fuel coffee cannot be finished,"I purchased this because I typically enjoy strong coffee and I wanted to give this a try.  I cannot drink this. It is bitter and almost chokes you. I have tried it several times, not wanting to waste the money I paid for a two pack, but have given up. There are many strong bold coffee K-cups out there that are quite good. But this is undrinkable."
1.0,worse chia seed I ever had,"I have tried about ten brands of chia seeds. These are the WORSE chia seeds I have ever had. They are full of black large sand or small rocks. I really wish I could send them back or get a refund or something. They are really horrible and now I am stuck with 5 pounds of them. Do not buy them, they are really bad. I ordered them about three weeks ago and just ran out of my others, so I opened these. When I went on now after using them several times with the same horrible rock problem, I found they increased their price by $30.00.  That is a joke, I would not get these again if they gave them to me free, but a $30.00 increase in just a couple of weeks time is crazy. Please save yourself and buy from another source."
5.0,Benecol,Just got my blood work back and lowered it by 20 pts.  This is the only thing I have added to helping lower my cholesterol.
5.0,orange spice in black tea is great,"This is the finest tea we've ever tasted, good any time of the day, or night for that matter. We'll be enjoying it for many months. Great that we found it at Amazon."
1.0,A Real Loser for Walden Farms!,"Most Walden Farms products -- and I've tried over a dozen -- I'd rate four to five stars.  Perhaps not as good as the high calorie stuff, but outstanding for zero calories and zero carbs.  However, this peanut spread is nothing short of disgusting.  It tastes more like chemicals, very little like peanut butter.  I took one taste and threw the balance in the garbage.  Save you money!  But do try their salad dressings and syrups!"
5.0,Fresh  Canine Breath,"These dry chews help scrape teeth clean and helps whiten teeth.  They are not appealing however, to every dog. Of my two dogs, one will eat them and one will not. The one who does eat them didn't really love them at first bite, it was more of an acquired taste.  Reducing plaque and tartar is something every pet owner must think about and these chews made right here in The USA are one way to accomplish that along with brushing your dog's teeth."
1.0,Cat lethargic and sick for two days,My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.
1.0,Way too expensive,"The cost of 48 packs including shipping comes to $43.8 cents per package. I purchase the same on sale at my grocery store for 10 packs for $1.00 which is 10 cents per pack.  Now I know it is wise to stock up when they are on sale.  This is no bargain, just the opposite."
5.0,"WE LOVE!! Chewy, Spicy Ginger Candy!","So this is a great big giant bag of Gin Gins BOOST.  They are VERY gingery.  If you are not down with the ginger, these are definitely not for you.  You might want to try a small package first if you are on the fence.  These are great on roadtrips.  The kids love 'em.  The cat even likes to bat the individually wrapped candies around the house.  My horse always knows when I have them in my pocket and will NOT stop doing cute, nosey, horsey things trying to get one from me.  They are really strong and seem spicy but they actually work to calm my stomach down.  Not sure why, but they do and I don't mind as I've had issues with ulcers and whatnot. and they actually help me, not make my stomach feel worse.  Awesome product if you love ginger, and we do!!  This is about as ginger to the max as you can get."
1.0,Not what is shown in the picture!,What is shown in the picture is a 900g can of Nido.  What you actually get is a 360g can.  Deceptive.  Note that this is a review of the product as depicted.  Nido as a dried milk is quite good.
5.0,The Cadillac of Tomato Pastes,"I have several favorite recipes that use tomato paste, but they many of them only use a couple of tablespoon.  With canned paste, I usually ended up throwing out the rest of the can after a week in the refrigerator made it taste like the can.  I first used Amore paste when I lived in Europe and I loved it.  It has a rich tomato flavor, no metal taste from the can and it keeps for weeks in the refrigerator.  It's more expensive than the small cans, but considering that I don't throw any away, it's cheaper in the long run."
1.0,yuck.,"I am used to Peets coffee, so I prefer a strong, clean flavor. This coffee tastes like cigarette ashes mixed with burnt wood. There is no discernable mocha flavor. It seemed old tasting, in fact. I would return it if I could."
5.0,No Flops Here,"My whole family loves when I get the belly flops.  Sometimes we like a particular selection of belly flops more than others, but for the most part it has been great.  They really are the best jelly bean on the market."
5.0,Great package design,"My baby (9 months old) is usually pretty picky, preferring mostly pears, apples, and squash, and she does very much like this juicy pear and garden greens flavor, but Since every baby's taste is different, this review is more about the packaging than the flavor.  It comes in a pouch with a great little screw top that, when removed, reveals a straw sized opening for you to squeeze the food through.  This is GREAT because it allows the baby to suck the food out, thus avoiding the SUPER messy alternative spoon feeding, however, you can't simply hand it to the baby and allow her to feed herself, because as soon as they squeeze it all squirts out.  That's not a big deal, I just hold onto it as she sucks, which is still easier than spoon feeding! The package also reseals by simply screwing the top back on, so you can store it for later feedings. Another thing that's really nice (for older babies) is that the package size is a larger 4.5oz, instead of the typical 4oz glass or plastic jars made by Gerber, Beechnut, etc. The package is great for traveling as well! It takes up a lot less space than the glass or plastic containers, so it's easy to toss in a diaper bag for a quick trip or pack a lot for a longer vacation! Overall, I like them a lot and would recommend them to any parent on the go!"
1.0,Ick.  big chunks of salt.,"This hazelnut crunch chocolate has big chunks of salt in it. The salt seems to be what makes it crunchy, not the hazelnuts. Ick. The package makes no reference to salt."
5.0,Quality food; no unwanted smalls; cats gobble it up and are healthy,"My cats love this stuff.  I give two of them one can a day and the rest of their diet is dry food (also Organix).  They are only 1.5 years old, so the effects of keeping the cats healthy may not be obvious, but they are both calm-tempered, gentle and friendly overall.  No major shedding, stool is generally in good shape, and they are enegetic.  PS  I know the stuff is expensive, but I have had cats and dogs both in the past.  Often, when they get into their senior years, they begin to their physical constraints.  I have seen organic food do wonders for cats who are older and therefore I decided to use organic food for my cats from their kittenhood.  I guess I won't find out until later on how it impact their longevity, but so far, I see nothing but very healthy cats able to buck whatever illnesses come their way.  Best, Steven Epstein"
1.0,These scare me.  Look at what I've found online:,"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:  ""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""  The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.  Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""  [...]  Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  ""At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,"" [...]  I'm still extremely leary."
5.0,"Basil mustard, Fallot","Excellent! All the mustards I've tried of this brand are very good. Great price for a great product. I am French, I know a good mustard when I taste one, and these are it."
1.0,Nasty.,"This soup is disgusting, plain and simple.  It tastes synthetic and chemically.  The broth is bizarre.  The tortellini (of which there are 5, and supposedly that's TWO servings) are mushy and utterly bland.  The only veggies in there are stewed tomatoes and some onion pieces, at least that I could find.  Don't waste your time or your money.  Gross."
5.0,Best Chai Latte for Your Money!,"Ok, so I'm sure this isn't authentic Chai to everyone. But for a person, like myself, that lives in a rural area with very few coffee shops this is perfect. I can't afford to buy a single latte for the same price I could pay for a box of 8 packets. And why should I? This mix is wonderful and I don't even have to add milk! Just heat some water or pour in the packet. Instant goodness."
1.0,cannot even taste the potato chips...,"ordered this product.. all i can taste is the sweet milk chocolate, nothing with the potato chips at all. it is supposed to come from pa dutch general store but mine says in the box that it was shipped from venture store in fredericksburg, va."
5.0,Better tasting than canned!!,"I am from the Caribbean, so I know how coconut milk for cooking should taste.  For many years I have used either a fresh coconut (which to me is a lot of work, with the breaking open the coconut, removing piulp from the hard shell and grating or blending) or canned Asian products (some with strange aftertaste - you have to use entire can unless you freeze remainder).  When I went back home for a visit this year, I saw this powder in the store, bought a pack because I was skeptical, and was amazed.  I use it for cooking and you can make it as creamy as you wish based on your recipe.  I brought some back with me and thought I would have to get it sent in the mail from back home.  I checked Amazon and I am very happy to find this right here. I am not vegan and I know where ""MILK based sodium caseinate"" comes from.  If you are looking for a no-hassle authentic tasting coconut milk - this should be your choice!!"
5.0,nice,The Keurig fits nicely on top of the drawer.  The drawer opens and closes with ease. It organizes your K-cups and saves counter shape.
5.0,NOW-Date Sugar Yum!,"Of all the date sugars I've tried to bake with, this is by far my favorite. I simply substitute 1 cup date sugar plus 2-3 tablespoons water (to help it mix well) for 1 cup granulated or brown sugar. I've found that cookies made with date sugar are always better the next day (if they last that long). Great results making peanut butter, brownies, honey snickerdoodles rolled in date sugar and cinnamon, vanilla wafers. For chocolate chip cookies, I mix date sugar with a little water for one type of sugar and unrefined cane sugar (Rapadura or Sucant) for the other. The kids love them!"
1.0,Made me VERY sick,"I have used other brands of Maca with no problem.  This one made me very, very sick to my stomach with pain and nausea.  It took me a few weeks to isolate what was making me sick - had a full gastro work-up and everything - that's how sick I was!  Today, after being healthy again for 2 months I tried 1/2 tsp of maca to test and am sick and nauseous.  I know many people take maca with no problems.  I only post this so those who get sick will hopefully not struggle as long as I did to figure out what is causing it."
5.0,Milk Bones,"This is something I never want to be without for my dogs! They are enjoyable for them, of course, but they also aid in helping to keep their teeth & breath cleaner... thank you."
1.0,HORRIBLE!!,It said that I was going to be able to get a 5 pack and only one can was sent out.  I would NEVER order from this company again!!!
1.0,dont get me,I didn't get my stuff what what is remind remind of got got another Few  cases some day now never get any thing form you
5.0,Good Quality,"This bone is VERY BIG. So for the price it is definitely a good deal. It will last over a year for my 2 big dogs (1 a Labrador, the other a golden retriever) even if they chew it every day."
5.0,love these chips,I really do recommend Pop Chips.  If you are looking for the 100 calorie snack this is it.  They taste great.
1.0,Sulphur Dioxide- Toxic Preservative,"This product contains sulphur dioxide as a preservative, which if taken in high amounts could be toxic.  Asthmatics should also be careful of products with sulphur dioxide, including many dried fruits.  Care should be taken by the manufacturer to create products to avoid preservatives or use naturally occurring preservatives rather than chemicals."
5.0,Excellent Product,This product is very good smells very nice like Professional Groomers use. ITem came quickly. This item is a good item for families that have pets who like to go outside alot and jump on the furniture when they come back into the house. A little spray and they are like new.
5.0,Smoothie Extraordinaire,Great product for those that want a tropical experience. Could be a little thicker base as the smoothies were just a little on the watery side. May have been the amount of ice cubes I used. But still made a nice tastey smoothie.
5.0,Great with cold press coffee,"When I was young (after WWII) coffee and chicory essense was all one could get.  It had a great taste. Recently I discovered that this mix originated in South India and was introduced to France via the French Colony there.  Chicory gives a 'chocolate tinge' to the flavor and assists the coffee to take up more water.  Made in the cold press manner,see my review of the Hario Mizudashi Cold Brew product, the result is smooth, nonbitter coffee ecstacy.  This product, perfectly granulated, is ideal for brewing this way.  Hooray for Frontier Natural Chicory!"
5.0,Great taste and great price! A+++,"I love Belgian waffles and this mix makes a delicious waffle without all the trouble of making them from scratch.  They are really good, and I'm fussy.  I haven't tried them as pancakes yet."
1.0,too acidic,"Bought this at a boutique market in So Cal.  I did so because the label said it was sweet.  I don't know if it was on the shelf too long (as with alot of products in these boutiquey low volume markets), but it was soooo not even close to sweet, just pure tart vinegar.  It went straight into the trash.  I didn't see any expiration date jumping out at me.  Would have been nice to see one prominently so I could have been warned."
5.0,Great tasting syrup,"Wow, reviewers weren't kidding.  This was the best tasting maple syrup I've tasted so far.  Rich, dark and flavorful..plus it's organic. What more do I want from a maple syrup?"
1.0,"Old, dry, disgusting when bought from Amazon!","I've never had a problem with Amazon, but I've ordered this product TWICE, and BOTH times the bars were almost white because the chocolate was so old, dry, and totally disgusting. When I buy these from Trader Joe's, they're great, but from Amazon - stay away! They've refunded me both times, but apparently still haven't fixed the problem, as more and more people are saying the same thing. What's going on Amazon?"
5.0,Best Everyday Tea,"This is a wonderfully rich, full flavored tea. It is suitable for every day drinking. This is one of the few teas that can stand up to adding milk. PG Tips is rich, dark, and full of flavor.  As an American, once I got used to drinking this fine English blend I cannot go back to American blends such as Tetley or Lipton.  A fine fine tea, delivered fresh, and quickly."
1.0,never got,"never got this product but they sent me a e-mail saying i would be refunded that never happened, and then i realized that there was a time fram so that was that,no product or refund buyer beware"
1.0,Smells pretty bad,"I purchased this for my baby, but as soon as I opened it smelled pretty bad. I tried to give it to my baby and she hated it, she threw up. I don't recommend this product. Gerber Rice Cereal is much better."
5.0,Red Gold in a tube,"I can't believe this isn't an American staple condiment yet.  I first had this about 16 years ago along with the Hungarian mustard in a tube and I carried them to school with me to put on everything I ate - until one day, it was gone and I've been without it ever since.  Right now, it isn't available for purchase on Amazon (or anywhere as far as I know).  Hopefully that changes soon.  It's ridiculous how good and easy to use this is."
1.0,service from vender,product was fine but it took 2 weeks to arrive-would not use this vender again
5.0,Hooked on Cakesters,"The cakesters melt in your mouth.  I love these so much, that I am writing this review at 4:30am.  Couldn't sleep, so needed a little cakester and milk.  Did the trick.  Good night."
5.0,Monster Muncher!,These are just as I remember them when I was in the UK!  I guess that should be expected since they are the same thing!
1.0,Missing cups,The package I ordered for my 78 year old mother had already been opened and 12 cups were missing. This happened both with the hot chocolate (6 cups missing) and the decaf order (6 cups missing)  Will probably not order from this group again.
1.0,Pain is Good #37 Garlic Hot Sauce,I have to say that I find this particular bottle disappointing.  I have purchased this item before in New Orleans and the flavor was better than the recent bottle I have received.  I won't purchase again on-line but will wait to find it in stores.  Even the color of the hot sauce was more orange than usual.
5.0,Delicious!,"I think this has a nutty peanut-buttery taste.  I mix it in my green smoothies and I love the taste and texture.  I have tried other Manitoba Hemp Powders, like the 50 but I like this one the best because the powder is finer and does not give your smoothies a gritty texture."
1.0,don't bother,"This product was not what we were looking for, and on top of that, one of the jars had a lot of mold inside. Quite disgusting!  Look elsewhere."
5.0,Great Product,"This is a great product, at a great price. I couldn't believe the how fast it got to me.I definitely will keep buying from this company."
1.0,Added Sugar and Oil,"Be aware these cherries are loaded with added sugar and oil. These are tart cherries, there is no reason why refined sugars should be added to an already sweet product."
5.0,best organic soba noodles I've yet found,"I still am looking for the fabled organic 100% buckwheat soba noodles. But until then, these are what I'll be eating. The ten pound box is great - small, no extra packaging, but it will keep you in soba for a good long time even if you're a complete fiend. (This is not speculation, I tested it.)"
1.0,"Gritty, oily and yukky taste!","I have been making coconut oil smoothies using canned coconut milk and fruit and then adding a tablespoon of pure coconut oil.  I thought it would be better to use the Coconut Manna since the oil is already in it.  First I tried tasting it from a spoon (after mixing it thoroughly).  It was very gritty, very oily, and didn't have a fresh coconut taste.  It was like eating really oily, gritty peanut butter, but didn't taste as good as peanut butter.  Then I mixed it in a smoothie and it was still very gritty and so thick and ""oily"" tasting I threw out the smoothie without finishing it.  One of these days I will try coconut cream from another company -- maybe it will taste better and won't be so gritty."
5.0,Yummy~My treat instead of High Sugar Cookies.,"First I will make note this page says sweetened with sorbitol, they are not. They are sweetened with Splenda. I think they taste as good as any other basic vanilla creme cookie. I like a bite of sweet at night but sugar keeps me awake so these fit the bill. The special that was going on when I got them made it a great deal. They cost up to $3.99 a pack where I live.....so this is a SWEET deal.  They still have calories so you cannot eat the whole bag but they don't spike your sugar. Three cookies are 130 calories and 6 gms of fat. They are very sweet anymore and you may feel sick."
1.0,Don't waste your $$,"I purchased this oil as I was thrilled that a local grocer actually carried it.  It was a 20.00 bottle.  What a waste of money.  There is so little truffle flavor that you end up using way more than what is normal.  Now, someone who hasn't been in the kitchen for too long might think that this is ""wonderful"" but no..Don't buy..End of story"
1.0,Sludge in your Coffee Pot!,"One word... disgusting! It isn't coffee, despite the product saying that it is! Plus, Amazon won't stand behind their labeling error and take the junk back!"
5.0,Great Bones for Canine Dental Health,"As recommended by the vet, I give all my dogs these bones.  They are a good teeth cleaner and dissolve after a while, so there's no worry about them 'over-doing it'.  I have older dogs, and one had almost no teeth, but she *loved* chewing on bones.  So, I tried these, and she was a happy camper, because she could gum the chewie right along with the other two dogs--no competition or feeling left out :)"
5.0,Best tasting oatmeal ever !!!,"I have been eating this oatmeal for about a month now and have no problems - it seems to be as advertised - no gluten. I get severe stomach pains when eating anything with gluten it it and this oatmeal does not affect me at all. It is the best tasting oatmeal that I've eaten and I grew up on oatmeal, am now 69 years old. In the past I've always bought the Old Fashioned oatmeal and prefer to eat it raw with apple juice on it, cinnamon and raisins. Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free oatmeal needs to be cooked as it is straight grain that has been steel cut, not refined so it would be a little hard to eat raw. I only cook it for about 4 - 5 minutes and love it. It has a consistency that is different than store-bought oatmeal - seems to have more substance, which the store stuff must have stripped from the grain, even the old fashioned kind. I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves oatmeal, and I can only say that this is the only oatmeal that doesn't give me stomach pain."
5.0,"Not just for kids, I love them too!","I love these fruit snacks!  My duaghter loves them as well, but I wasn't expecting to like them.  They have a great texture, chewy but soft.  And they have great fruit flavors including: orange, three types of berries, and peach.  They are very nutritious, since they are made from real fruit!  They are also fat free and have no preservatives!  The 80 pouch box has lasted over a month, with somebody reaching into the box every day.  The individual pouches are on the small side, my daughter prefers to have two of them occassionally.  I wish the box had a punch out front tray, that would enable easier access of the pouches, similar to a display in a store.  Also, the combination of fruits in each pouch aren't even, with most pouches having alot of the peach & strawberry variety, and less of the other flavors.  But this not a deal killer by any means!"
1.0,Too Expensive for the Quality of Food,"This food was not only super messy, but it made my dog itch like mad! The kibble is very dusy/grainy. You touch it and kibble fuzz gets all over your hands, it was always getting stuck on my dogs face when he would eat. It could be that my dog is just allergic to corn, but having owned dogs in the past any food that contained corn almost always made my other dogs feet itchy too. I am not going to rant on about high quality food vs. low quality food, but some of the SD Dog foods out there are way over priced for the ingredients that are in them. The only reason I was feeding this to my current dog is because we adopted him and the shelter gave us a free bag; so we used it to transition him to new food with no corn."
5.0,BEST TASTING COCOA,Hershey's Special Dark has a much richer taste than the regular. Great for hot cocoa. This product was REALLY hard to find.
5.0,Sweet!,"A great energy shot for an unbeatable price. I love watermelon and was excited to find this. I don't care much for the 6 Hour Power watermelon flavor, it's a bit dull. Obviously flavor isn't a big deal when you can down it in one shot, however I use energy shots frequently so I love when I can enjoy the taste. Red Rain has a superbly sweet watermelon flavor. It's sweetness is reminiscent of the Monster Energy Shots (which I also love). Red Rain has now become my new favorite. When compared to Monster it has less sugar (carbs) and less calories (Red Rain has 0), and it gives me the same amount of energy; all for less money.  I recommend this to all Energy Fiends."
1.0,Tastes like licking a shoe!,"I'm sorry...I tried really hard to like this tea but in the end it tasted like licking a shoe. Unless you add a whole lot of sugar to it it is very difficult to choke down. There are a multitude of better tasting herbal teas out there, this particular combination is really, really bad."
5.0,fast shipping,"I am always amazed by wild rice, which is actually not real rice. the package arrived soon, but i haven't cooked it yet."
5.0,Best I've Ever Tried,"Calhoun Bend Mill Apple Cinnamon Crisp Mix is the best premix I've ever used. It does not contain oatmeal as some do, and crisps perfectly when you add the right amount of butter. I've even used 2 packs at once to have more crisp. Sadly, its getting harder and harder to find this in stores now. I'm glad Amazon.com has it available."
1.0,Terrible,"Received a day early. Opened box, opened package. Microwaved brownie briefly. Smelled. Tried to eat. Threw away. Have 11 left to give to enemy."
5.0,Cat's favorite treat,"I've tried several brands and flavors of treats for my cat, but this is the only one she really likes. Finding the dairy flavor after we moved was difficult, and ordering from Amazon is easy and keeps a supply on hand."
1.0,$2.60 a can?????,"Buying in bulk, 12 cans at $31.20 is $2.60 a can. What motivation would I have for buying online?"
1.0,Not as good as all the HYPE!,"There is entirely too much hype about this candy. Warheads are much better, and have an overall balanced sour flavor profile. These have a miniscule amount of sour taste, then get sweet immediately. Remember just because its sour to 1 or 2 individuals does not means it, should be HYPED up like this."
1.0,This has to be a mistake,Two 3 oz packets of pectin should be about four bucks.  I hope this is a case price but nothing in the information says otherwise.
1.0,DO NOT BUY,"Package pictured is NOT what you get.  You get 1.5 ounce TOTAL food.  That works out to, what, $160/pound?  Regardless if your kid likes the yogurt melts, you can find them much cheaper than that."
5.0,best caviar for the dollar. Great compared to grocery store brands.,"This brand is not to salty, not to fishy. Great caviar taste with ample pop. The freshness is evident. I have bought this brand over and over and it's never let me down. I've introduced several friends and family members to caviar using this brand and it never fails to impress. Highly reccomended."
5.0,Good stuff!,"Very good quality beans. I'd compare it to Starbucks - I found I needed to use less beans, because the accustomed (to me) amount almost made my hair curl!"
1.0,Buffalo Worst Dog Food ever! Product is toxic and is being recalled! Both of my dogs got extremely sick thanks to this food!,"First of all, the ""gain control"" formula is a true joke and has a very deceiving label!!!! One of my dogs gained more than 20 pounds in less than 6 months!!!!!! After 6 months, he could no longer hold the food down as he started vomiting the food and have watery diarrhea 4 to 5 times a day and he would start shaking because he could not hold the food in.  We were so concerned that we took him right away to the vet and vet requested us to change his diet immediately.  We did and his diarrhea stopped right away.  Prior to giving him this food, he was healthy and then coincidentally, he started to have major health problems.  Furthermore, we got him a companion dog in excellent health condition who was used to eating mainly dry food and we gave her some of this food and to determine whether this food just had an impact (or negative allergic reaction) on our first dog and whether she would be affected or not.  Sure enough, same first day she ate her first bowl of this Buffalo brand food, she had diarrhea and she even woke us up at 2am the first night because she could not hold it anymore. She had diarrhea 6 times in just 24 hours.  A side note on this dog, she has a strong stomach because prior to adopting her, the previous owners told us she eats just about anything from fruits, vegetables, different dry foods and her stomach does not get upset.  After all this nightmare and realizing there is no quality at this Buffalo corporation,  we now have started to give them real organic food made by us since we could no longer trust these dog food companies and our older dog has immediately lost the weight he gained thanks to that disgusting, toxic and cheap food. If you have ever watch the movie ""Food Inc"" and have realized what food is available for human beings, just imagine what type of food these dog food Corporations are selling to our dogs (babies)!  Now meal time with our home made food is their favorite time of the day, they absolutely love it and start jumping up and down something that never happened with any type of dry food.  Today to our surprise, we found out that THIS PRODUCT IS BEING RECALL FOR CONTAINING TOXIC INGREDIENTS. We are shocked that by giving them this Buffalo food, we were putting in great danger the lives of our beloved dogs.  If you really love your dog and he/she is truly part of your family, make him/her their own food to protect their health and life. Is really easy to make and does not take that much time.  There are books in Amazon that guides you through the food dogs should and should not eat. Now our dogs eat real chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a spoon of organic multi-vitamin which we mix it all together when serving.  This will not only make them happier, healthier, stronger, but also increase their lifespan.  The info below will show you some of the reality and suffering of those who have fed their dogs with Buffalo food:  truthaboutpetfood com /articles/more-worrisome-news-on-blue-buffalo-dog-food.html"
5.0,Best Sencha I've Had,"I don't have the bulk bag but I do have the smaller 3.5 OZ bag, but I'm pretty sure they're both the same. I make it a habit now of whenever I go to Seattle to pick up a bag or two from the Japanese Supermarket. When you open the bag there's a sweet, vegetal aroma that is emitted by the high quality leaves. When you drink it, it leaves a nice sweet/ vegetal aftertaste that makes this my favorite sencha. For the more tea enthusiasts; in my opinion, this tea rivals (or sometimes better) some gyokuro teas I've had and at a cheaper price (generally)."
1.0,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"The description above says that it includes 4 types of cereals (two of special k, and two of smart start). However, I received only 34 cereals of smart start and special k. other 26 were mini wheats, granola(with raisins) and lean crunch sth. I hate raisins, and now when I eat, i have to sort all raisins out from the granola! If they are not going to sell what is advertised, they shouldn't sell it at all!!!!! THE WORST AMAZON PRODUCT EVER! liars."
5.0,Works as advertised.,Pugs are pretty notorious for refusing to take their pills (or being able to eat around them then spit out the pill when you're not looking). These work to make them want to take their pills. Pill time has become the equivalent to treat time. So easy. Only negative is that it can get a bit expensive.
5.0,Love Zots alots!,A nice candy refresher from days past. Always prompt shipping and yummy candy! The three flavor pack is the best bang for the buck.
1.0,"Love Yogi tea, but not this","I could not get past the sweet flavor in this tea.  It leaves a brutal aftertaste.  I normally enjoy Yogi tea and drink it on a daily basis, but this one just didn't work."
1.0,"I tried, I really did","I really tried to like this cereal.  I had tried the chocolate, chocolate flavor and didn't like it so I was hoping that I would like this one better but I didn't.  The cereal turned to mush just after a few minutes in the milk and it tasted like burned brownies.  The picture on the box is very misleading as the cereal itself is not nearly as big.  Definetly does not live up to it's name."
1.0,DONT BUY!!!!!,"Ordered 5.5oz cans and received 3oz cans. Called Petcare Rx for return, and have to jump thru hoops even though error is on their side. No timely or satisfactory resolution. BEWARE from buying from them and be prepared to have extra food on hand for your animals if you do because it'll take quite awhile to get the food you ordered. I made that mistake. NEVER again!"
1.0,Arrived with bugs,"My Tulsi arrived, and happy to share it, I opened it up to share with friends. What a disaster! Not only did the Tulsi contain a few bugs, it is not ""pure"" Tulsi. Though it lists three types of Tulsi, it appears to contain other elements.  The bugs also indicate that it was not stored properly. I will be getting my tea elsewhere!"
1.0,Don't buy this! bad bad new recipe!!!,"Lindt changed the recipe and it's completely blend, sweeter and leaves a greasy texture in your mouth when it melts. What are these people thinking? That their customers are dumb or what??? I'm so disappointed. This new chocolate sucks and I feel cheated."
5.0,Fabulous snack,"This snack is wonderful and very addicting. I've just reordered the 5# bag today. It's a great snack and the fact that it's low fat is a big plus. We love the spicy flavor of the wasabi. The cost beats that of our local supermarket by about 10 to 1. As an aside, our dog loves these too, but she's a little odd."
5.0,Entire family LOVES this ketchup,"Ketchup isn't something I had given much thought to, in the past.  The sad truth is, we had run out of ketchup in the dead of winter and I could get it from Amazon faster than I was going to get to the store.  I read the great reviews and decided to give this one a try.  Not only do we LOVE this ketchup, but we gave bottles to family members and they now LOVE it also.  ""Let us know if you need us to take any more of that ketchup off your hands!"" they say.  :)  I love the taste, the texture, and I love that I can give it to my kids and actually feel pretty good about them dipping everything in it.  Highly recommend!  The only drawback, if you are a stickler about expiration dates, is that we did not use an entire case before it expired (part of the reason we shared with family).  I ordered my case in February, and it expired December of that year."
1.0,Not What I Expected,"Saw this advertised on the food channel, so was anxious to try it......very disappointed.....hard crust and tasteless.....i wanted the sausage patty, but did not get it."
1.0,Molded chestnuts.,"I ordered these chestnuts on 8/20/2012 and received them on 8/24/2012.  The listed date of production on most of these packages is 10/29/2011 with an expiration date of 12/28/2012.  However, multiple packages contained molded, black chestnuts.  The insides of the molded packages were also very wet and sticky.  I've purchased Galil chestnuts from local stores in the past and the products SHOULD be dry when opened and the chestnuts should be a tan/brown color."
1.0,Do not order this if it has to be shipped long distances!,I received this item in a box with other that were packaged well. This item was just thrown into the bottom of the box without any bubble wrap or popcorn to keep it from moving around. All three tubs were upside down and had melted. So of course the butter had leaked all over the inside of the package and box. Totally unusable. This item should not be ordered if it has to travel a long distance!!
1.0,Bad Smell,"This dog food has a strange, bad odor to it. My dogs won't eat it. Other dogs must like it becuase Merrick is a very successful company, but I won't be buying this again."
5.0,ADDICTIVELY GOOD,"I love these, totally addicted, and Amazon is definitely cheaper than in the local store ..  IF you can even find them locally. Delicious"
5.0,WOW best pancakes I've ever had!,"My boyfriend has Celiac and we got this mix to feed his craving for pancakes. The reviews do not lie, this makes the most wonderful pancakes I've ever had. Perfect texture and amazing flavor (I think the almond meal contributes quite a bit), haven't tried making anything else with the mix but will as soon as we get a 4 lb bag. The price is a little steep but worth it for the flavor, if you have a wheat allergy or Celiac. I don't have any issues with gluten, but these pancakes will be the only ones I make from now on. You will have a very difficult time believing these are gluten free."
1.0,Contain cyanocobalamin dirty form of Vit B12,cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin B12 is in the product. We wonder why cancer among kids is raising...we are not eating food anymore but synthetic toxic crap. Despicable! Bought it ounce will never buy it again!  You better off with an organic egg/yellow preferably from a real farmer  answer: methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin (that is the best of the best)  Do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the FDA if you do not want to be flamed do you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you.
5.0,A forgotten favourite. . . healthy and delicious.,"These are wonderful! I know the sardine skin and bones are the added health booster, but I just can't do those bits. So, I buy these. . .They are clean and tasty. My children (5,7&9) prefer them to tuna. They ask for sardine sandwiches constantly, I also use them in a Scilian style pasta. A great price, especially if you have ever purchased the same item in Whole Foods."
1.0,Disappointing,I planted mine in a separate area next to my yellow and mixed color sunflowers and they never sprouted. (shrugs)  I wonder if I got an old batch of seeds.
1.0,NASTY,"I 'm glad I got a free sample and didn't waste my money. This has no discernable coffee taste, nor does it taste like caramel. It just tastes like a cup of sugar and artificial flavors. I'm going to stick to starbucks via with milk when I don't want to go out for coffee. The convenience does not make up for the taste."
1.0,Yuk!,I love cheese-flavored snacks and I was highly disappointed by these. Their styrofoam texture was offset only by putrid tang of faux cheese powder. I'm pretty sure the only good Smart Fries flavor is salt and vinegar.
5.0,"One, one, wonderful","One, one, wonderful ... from the Beach Boys ""Smile"" album. This tea is that ... wonderful aroma and taste. Try it and Smile !!!  And .. It always ships on time !!!"
5.0,"Perfect smell, great taste","I was using 3 sugar packages for 16 oz of coffee. One Splenda tube is almost as sweet as 3 sugar packages (3 spoons of sugar) and saves me from unnecessary sugar consumption. Hazelnut flavor smells amazing. Taste is great too but it also depends on the coffee used. In my experience, it goes best with Nescafe, other instant coffee brands did not make such an amazing taste with this item. And for some reason, no Splenda product goes well with brewed coffee."
5.0,My husband loves this,This was purchased as a last minute gift for my husband at Christmas and he loved it. It is very cute.
1.0,Bland with nasty aftertaste,"This cereal is plenty crunchy, but I'm shocked by the people saying it tastes good.  I found it to be bland, with a little bit of a nasty aftertaste.  I don't know how they managed bland and nasty at the same time, but they did.  I had two bowls, just to make sure my first opinion wasn't off in some way, but then I threw the box out."
1.0,tastes awful,"I took 3 sips of these tea, and I nearly gagged.  I think it tastes spicy, like nutmeg.  I can't stand the taste or smell of nutmeg, so I can't drink this tea. Just my two cents."
5.0,GREAT Sauce for the price !,This is great stuff!  If you are looking for something really flavorful to spice up your dinner......... THIS AIN'T IT !  If you have tried Daves Insanity Sauce or Endorphin Rush or similar capsaicin products you will really like this !  Its NOT the hottest stuff I have ever had............ but for the price its AWESOME!
5.0,Delicious,"The cereal diet is boring. Don't get me wrong, I love cereal, but going on the ""special K"" diet just messes with your head.  This cereal bar helps! As has been said in other reviews, it is reminiscent of a rice krispy treat, but it is a little denser, not really marshmellowy or buttery and more like a cookie. I'm not using it as part of the cereal diet, but just as a snack instead of a candy bar. It is satisfying like a candy bar but with only 90 calories and with cereal as the first ingredient.  If you're looking for a healthier alternative to a cookie or a more interesting snack than a chewy bar, this is a good way to go."
1.0,Poor product.,I received this item in a shipment of other items ordered from this store. I order black fungus or tree ear mushroom quite often. I know how they are suppose to look. This product looked like it had been ran over by a steam roller and reduced to crumbs and powder. I will be returning this for a refund. The package was shipped in a good protective box. so i know it was shipped in this condition. I would have never fulfilled an order that looked like this.
1.0,kinda nutty,"I have tried several honduran organic coffees, all have had a smooth finish akin to milk chocolate.  This brand has a strong nutty finish like peanuts.  Not a very drinkable coffee for me, be aware that once opened, coffee is not returnable so make sure you like it."
5.0,Best healthy bars *ever* for the sweet-tooth!,I don't know how some of these people could give the CHOCOLATE Green Plus bars only one star?!  I guess it's possible that there are a small percentage of people out there who have very different taste buds.  Maybe they wanted to write about the ones without the chocolate?  Those I could see how people who do not normally use herbal medicine or eat healthy may think they're no good.  The ChocGP bars are awesome - the ingredients are amazing and for not having any sugar - HELLO!  I just love them.
5.0,great to have on hand,"I am 100% mexican and do make refried beans the old fashioned way, but it takes hours!!  I still make them occasionally, but these can't be beat for convenience and the taste is good too. (some other brands out there have odd seasonings added). You can doctor them up to achieve the flavor you desire.  I always have these on hand for after work quick mexican dinners!! Please, don't use canned, those are an insult to authentic mexican food."
1.0,poor taste,Strawberry flavor lacking.  When you open the box you cant even smell the aroma of strawberry.  Waste of money.  I has expected more from a Davidson tea
1.0,Old,Received the candy 3 days after it's expiration date. Disappointed as I expected to received candy that would last a long time.
5.0,I Crave It Like Coffee!!!,"I was a caffeine addict until it started to affect my health.  By the doctor's orders, I backed off the caffeine.  I went onto Amazon looking for decaf coffee, and I found Pero.  WHAT A GREAT FIND!!!  I now have several cups per day, but I don't feel guilty about it.  It has 3 ingredients--barley, malted barley, and chicory.  Maybe I am hooked on the chicory.  Is that possible?  I doubt it.  Anyway, I swear this stuff tastes more like coffee every time I drink it.  I have been tempted to play a practical joke with people at work by asking them to try my new ""coffee"".  I'll bet I could fool many of them.  I love Pero so much that I actually gave some to my Mom along with her chocolates for Mother's Day.  Love live Pero!"
1.0,totally wrong item than described,"This listing is for nestle cerelac mixed vegetables and rice with milk, but the item shipped are nestle cerelac mixed fruits and wheats with milk. Happened several times, and still totally wrong item sent. Not recommended to buy!"
5.0,The Best Refried Beans,"My family is completely vegetarian, and prefers to eat only organic when possible.  I was purchasing these at a local store and was paying well over $3 a can, and we were using 2-3 cans a week.  So I was thrilled to find cases available on Amazon!  Thank you for such a great price.  We will happily continue to buy these beans on a regular basis.  Amy's is a great brand, and these refried beans are simply terrific.  We love the spices and the flavor, and prefer the ""Traditional"" over the ""Amy's Refried Black Beans"" (although these are pretty good too).  Thanks again, Amazon."
5.0,Husband's choice!,"I have bought several kinds of gluten free bread mixes.  I have made GF bread from scratch.  Namaste is the bread my husband always tells me is the tastiest, although he has no idea which brand he is eating.  I add ground nuts and some almond flour to all bread mixes because he preferred whole wheat bread before the GF diet.  The nuts make the texture more like whole wheat.  I have used walnuts, pecans and almonds chopped in a small processor."
5.0,Kitties love it and a lot less expensive than the vet's,"One of the kitties has a very sensitive tummy, and I had been spending quite a bit of money, not to mention the inconvenience of running to the vet's every couple of weeks to buy their ""special"" brand.  One day I noticed that Purina made the vet's brand, and started to wonder if they made a version sold in the grocer.  Sure enough, Sensitive Systems from the Purina One line was in the store.  I slowly transitioned the kitties to it without any ill effects.  Purchasing this on the regularly scheduled delivery not only lowered my costs, it is so convenient to come home and find it waiting on my doorstep!  I am really pleased with the Purina One brand.  The cats are healthy, and can't wait for me to get up in the morning to bring it to them."
5.0,Another great tea,"Another great tea from Celestial Seasonings. This one has a subtle spicy lemony flavor. Very unique. I have tried many varieties of tea, gourmet, loose leaf, etc. and I keep going back to Celestial Seasonings. All natural, easy to find and very reasonably priced."
5.0,You won't believe they're sugar-free!,"Really delicious! Start out firm and become chewy (careful if you have loose bridge-work!)and are a great treat if you are trying to avoid sugar/carbs and like the taste of coffee candy. Remember that these are sweetened with ""sugar-alcohol"" which has a laxative effect if you really overdo it, but a few over the course of the day really satisfies the sweet tooth without all the carbs of regular candy. I think they're great!"
1.0,not the originals,"these are not the originals they are produced in Hungary and not Germany and taste differently. There are not bad at all, but they are not the same as the originals from Germany despite the fact they are produced in a Haribo factory."
5.0,delicious and healthy,"This is a very tasty and healthy cracker, full of dietary fiber.  I highly recommend it for taste, low calories, and texture."
1.0,QUALITY AND QUANTITY CHANGES,Beware this is no longer the product we all loved. The new packaging looks the same but what is inside is not. The tuna is dry and tasteless and the can is smaller. Now it only contains 5oz instead of 6oz. What happened???
5.0,OMG So so good!!,I recieved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal and Raisins Cookie in my Influenster Mom Voxbox 2012. My husband and kids devoured the cookie before I had a chance to look at it or taste it. So this is what they thought of the cookie. It was sooooo good according to my 4 year old son and 3 year old daughter. My husband said it was moist and soft and delicious. He is most definitely ready for me to asdd it to the grocery list. I gave this product a 5 star rating because these cookie totally rock!!!
1.0,If You Want to Make a Smoothie with It FORGET IT!,"It really isn't a POWDER.  It is more like a finely ground loose tea and won't blend in a smoothie because it is not ground finely enough.  Get Tradition brand if you want to make smoothies.  (It isn't organic, but at least it blends and it is also pure, meaning unsweetened.)  I am totally disappointed because this product wasn't as described."
5.0,Best Dry Food!,"I have tried numerous dry cat foods, but the one my cats like best is the Goodlife Recipe! Not sure if it's the yummy aroma, or just the sound of it being poured into their bowls, but they sure come running!  I feed our cats canned food, but always have a bowl of dry food available. Some of our cats prefer dry food, and this recipe is a winner! I like the fact that it's high in protein and has fiber and veggies too. Try it- you won't be disappointed!! Pricing on Amazon is great, the automatic delivery is a godsend- and free delivery is a winner!"
1.0,"Great bars, but...","These are some of my favorite bars, but these were old and very tough. I could not find a date on them, but they were obviously old.  I will not order these on-line again."
1.0,Way over priced!!!,"I was looking at the 5 lb package that has 250 pieces, but ordered this one by mistake.  It has 65 pieces for over $9.  There is nothing BULK about this package."
5.0,Delicious and versatile for the Low Carb dieter,"I have not eaten pasta in over six months, during which time I have steadily lost weight on the Dukan diet.  I kept reading about these ""noodles"" in the Dukan newsletter and now I finally tried them.  Found them to be versatile and delicious -- the flavor comes from whatever you mix them into.  Satisfying texture.  Easy to prepare, just be sure and rinse them thoroughly before you do anything else.  I found you don't have to blanch them in boiling water, which is what the package instructions say.  After rinsing, I simply soaked them in very hot tap water, then added them to my recipe."
1.0,Did not survive,"I recieved this product in a timely manner...however, a week in the stem and leaves started turning brown.  So I contacted the seller and was told that the browning was normal.  I just threw it away...i wasnt happy with this purchase.  I  have ordered several house plants off amazon but this is the first one i had to discard."
1.0,Terrible!,"I can't believe the good reviews of this product. The cereal has a light peanut butter SCENT, but tastes like straight up corn. No peanut butter flavor detectable. Only one other review mentions this. There are healthy cereals that taste great and there are peanut butter cereals that taste great (a'hem, Cap'n Crunch), but there is no overlap in the Ven diagram to cereals."
5.0,Sweet and easy!,"I carry a pouch in my purse just in case I haven't eaaten in a while and I have a ways to go. Very sweet but tasty honey, high in calories but the handy pouch allows for easy portability, which is a big plus. Good for plane rides where all you get is peanuts and nothing else. Cheaper by the box... Honey Stinger Gold Energy Gel, 1.3-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 24) "
1.0,overpriced,"This exact product is available at my discount health food store for half this price, which indicates that this seller may need to ""sharpen their pencil"".  Just a word for the budget-minded."
1.0,NO BUENO,"I had to get a special order to return this item, because there was something wrong with the berries dude!  They were crusty and gross, unlike this product on a typical day which is crunchy and refreshing.  No bueno!"
1.0,"Sorry, but I don't agree...","I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.  I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results. Sorry to sound so negative, but I did felt the need to share my experience - as it differs so much from the norm!"
5.0,Delicious and no Calories,"I love this stuff!!! Great in coffee, milk, over berries, mixed in drinks, etc. Best of all, it adds no additional calories and tastes great too!"
5.0,Great for hair! Does not smell horrible,"First I want to start by saying this oil does not stink. It does have a scent but it's nothing to make you upchuck your dinner. Anyway, oil is great for hot oil treatments. It is absolutely not to be left on the hair for days at a time as it makes my scalp itch! It makes my hair very shiny and moisturized. I love the size of the bottle, it will last a long time. I definitely recommend for AA ladies with dry damaged hair. You will see results. I also recommend  Amla Hair Powder 3.5oz powder by Hesh Pharma "
5.0,Great cat food,My cat loves these. Good price and convenience with Subscribe & Save - just make sure to check the e-mails for the price changes.
1.0,Too much sodium!!!,Wow!!! The amount of sodium is simply insane... You eat one of these and you are almost at the recommended daily amount of sodium. You can also taste too much salt...
5.0,Valentine's Day Gift,"My wife was very happy with these flowers, and I was very happy with the ease of ordering and the delivery of the flowers."
5.0,Sweet Potato treats are my girls favorite.,My 2 Maltese sisters can't wait to get back from there walk to get there sweet potato treat....they just go crazy over them......
1.0,Disgusting,"I tried this on a whim once when it was on sale - horrible, nasty stuff. I admit I'm not a great drinker of coconut water so I can't say if this is normal, but it tasted like old medicine. Like cough syrup that sat on your bathroom shelf for six years and then for a lark you decided to drink it."
5.0,MM Good!,U can taste the lemon in this blend.  I have tried several and the blend had more black pepper than the lemon flavor.  It is really good...especially on fish.
1.0,How many dogs must die before these treats are removed from the market,My dog and others love this treat. The problem is that hundreds and thousands of dogs have died in the US after consuming these treats. One death was that of a good friend as it killed her beautiful German Shepard.  Her death was completely avoidable because the problem with these treats was known but not publically shared. Purina claims these treats are safe and yet hundreds of dogs have died after eating them.  These treats are made in China where the problem first occured with dog and cat food years ago. Back then the problems resulted in the same initial denial.  Please read related articles on this subject and make an informed decision about purchasing these treats.
1.0,never again,"One month and 1 day has gone by and I still haven't received my order. I realize the nespresso pods are great, I'm just saying this company sucks!"
5.0,Great taste,This is a really great tasting salad dressing that is low in calories. You can use this in any kind of mixed salad. Really good product.
1.0,The Consistency is Very Odd!,"I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange.  It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout.  Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me.  Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste."
1.0,Terrible,"I've recently switched to drinking instant coffee due to time constraints and other reasons I won't get into on here. Let's just say I've drank hundreds of cups of instant over the last few months. Before drinking instant, I drank tea almost exclusively. Aside from being a former tea addict, I've had an appreciation of well brewed coffee in the past. My favorite coffee is Melitta's Sun & Moon organic. It's simply the best coffee I've ever had with perfect balance of rich taste and complexity. Formerly, when living in San Francisco, I really had no reason to ever go into Starbucks because there was always a Peet's near by, or a local coffee house. So I think I know a good cup of coffee.  Alright, now I'll get onto the instant coffees I've tried. I've drank Folgers instant, which has an awful chemical taste but it's tolerable for instant, I've drank Fred Meyer's organic select, which is actually quite good and doesn't have much of a nauseating aftertaste. I've had nescafe, which also has the awful instant chemical aftertaste. How does Starbucks VIA compare to these brands? It has the same nauseating checmical aftertaste of Folgers and Nescafe.  Starbucks VIA can be described as having sweet acrid bloom when it first hits your mouth that turns into chemical sweetness nauseating finish that makes you want to pour the whole thing out. There's no denying this is an instant. It's also a mediocre instant compared to generic organic select I've tried (which surprises me, honestly). I have no idea why someone would pay a premium for this, except they're very gullible and easily manipulated through brand loyalty and corporate marketing. Strange to me people would spend so much on an instant that comes in very environmentally unconscious packaging, costs almost 10x as much as any other instant, and tastes mediocre and only review it highly because it has Starbucks familiarity to naive and gullible consumers.  Next to try is Jacobs Krunung instant coffee, and I'm hoping for better results. Which shouldn't be too hard considering Starbucks VIA is one of the worst instants I've tried so far.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I strongly urge you to try purchasing Organic instant or perhaps Jacobs Krunung instead."
5.0,Never Fail Chili Spices Kit!,"We've used this product for years, and have loved it's flavor & consistency - always something you can count on!  We used to add the same spices using various recipes, but chili would always seem to come out differently each time.  No 'hit or miss' with this product - individual packets of each spice give you maximum control, should you want to add less.  We love this stuff so much, that we panic when we 'run low' at home (less than 3 kits), in case we can't find the Mix at our local grocery store!  So, we bought a case!"
1.0,Mint Surprise,"I'm a fan of delicious tea, and this seemed to have everything I want in a brew. Green tea? Check. Delicious fruit flavors of peach and mango? Check. On Amazon? Consider me sold!  However, I must have missed that single line of the description that says ""contains peppermint leaves"" because I sure was surprised when my delicious fruit tea came out tasting like a candy cane (and a bad one at that). The mint overpowers every other flavor, but the addition of fruit undercuts the peppermint, so it's not really a mint tea OR a fruit tea. It's mostly just a ""bleh"".  So awful I couldn't even give it away. Most people just smelled it and went ""no thanks""...can't say I blame them!  That said, Tea Forte has some good teas. This just isn't one of them."
5.0,nice,Hella good and spicy thank-you. I will be ordering more in the future  I give this 10 stars with no question
5.0,Amazing,"Bought one of these at the store the other day while buying a couple boxes of Instant Lunch and got one just to try it. If you like Instant Lunch/Cup Noodles then I recommend these, they cost more but they're worth it."
5.0,"Chomping vegetables, Batman","My Venus fly trap arrived promptly and in great condition! Thanks for the great service! Amazon is forcing me to write more words against my will because they are fascists.  Have a great day, everyone!"
1.0,Bad aftertaste,"I thought it was just me!  I'm having this debate with a coworker that Nestle Pure Life purified water tastes different than Ozarka spring water.  I like Ozarka natural spring water but can't stand Nestle Pure Life.  He showed me that Ozarka is a division of Nestle and it was all in my head, that the bottles are identical but just have different labels.  Looking closer at the labels, I see what the difference is.  The Nestle Pure Life is basically distilled water with added minerals.  So I wouldn't buy it unless you don't mind the taste of distilled water."
5.0,Timothy's Decaf,This brand has excellent coffee flavors and the decaffinated is a rich full taste. I have tried other brands but Tomothy's are very consistent and excellent value.
1.0,I can't believe people are paying this price!,"This is sad....this price is MORE THAN DOUBLE than what you pay at Bed, Bath, and Beyond....and there you can use d coupon and get it for even cheaper....paying more than $10 a box for this is just RIDICULOUS!!!  Shop elswehere!"
5.0,"Great product, delivered fast",I received the food very quickly and the price was great.
1.0,"$50+ for a single servng of instant coffee? This is somebody's idea of a joke, right?","If anyone out there is seriously considering forking out over fifty dollars for this, this is my advice to you:  Don't.  That'll be $40, please -- my standard purchasing consultation fee, in cases such as this.  You're welcome. Anytime."
5.0,Unique delicuous taste,"I opened my first bottle, and poured an ounce into the included ""shot glass"".  It is thick and a murky color.  I wasn't sure what to think, but it smelled ok, so I took a sip.  It was so different, definitely manogo-y, but also had another flavor I couldn't place.  Then it came to me, it tasted a bit like chocolate.  When I read the label, it said that cupuacu is a ""cousin"" of chocolate, so that explains it!  If it wasn't so expensive, I would have poured a glass and added a few ice cubes.  I have been drinking my little shot in the middle of the afternoon for a little pickup, due to natural caffeine and for a little sweet treat.  This drink supplies antioxidants as well as 100% of vitamins B6 and B12 with nothing artificial and no added sugar, a great product!"
1.0,it's a sugar bomb,"I bought the Cranberry Almond and the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio. I'm not sure how anyone can comment on the flavor - it's sooooo sweet. The non GMO glucose + the sugar + the honey masks any flavor this bar might have. It's my fault. I should have read more closely. Not sure I understand how this is a ""Low glycemic"" food. Definitely not a KIND option if you're trying to reduce your overall sugar consumption."
5.0,Smells like a blueberry muffin!,"I tried the fig and honey version first, and while they were good, these (the blueberry) are delicious.  The smell is just like a fresh baked blueberry muffin, and the taste is authentic (doesn't seem like processed blueberry).  I was pleasantly surprised.  While these are nothing like fig newtons (which I thought they might be based on packaging), they are a tasty, crunchy treat that isn't too sweet, and is a nice alternative to the typical boxed cookie."
5.0,Problems with reaching the tuna!,"I'm a big fan of chicken and tuna (and mermaids) so when I saw 48 cans on sale, I had to click Add to Cart. WHAT a MISTAKE. While tuna is nutritious and can easily be turned into various meals (tuna salad, tuna sandwich, tuna in a bowl, tuna as cat food...) you have to be able to REACH the tuna! This tuna is surrounded by a tough, cylindrical barrier. It is smooth, round, and looks and sounds like metal when you throw it against the wall so i'm pretty sure it's some type of new plastic made in China. I would stay away from this unless your cart also contains a can opener made in China."
1.0,Product Missing from Package,"Just opened this package and discovered that one of the twelve packs of gum had either fallen out or been removed prior to packaging. (I got 11 for the price of 12, what a deal.)  Apparently, I am outside the return window and can't get my money back.  I have had really good luck ordering from Amazon, but I am very disappointed with this purchase."
5.0,These are delicious!,"I try not to eat too many processed foods, but sometimes, like when you are traveling or backpacking, you need a convenient, pre-packaged food product. These bars are very tasty and they don't have any additives or strange ingredients. They are suitable for people with the common food allergies. For me, the clincher was that there is no added sugar except for agave nectar, which has a low glycemic index."
5.0,greatest coffee,"I think this is the best coffee i have ever made at home. Some coffees just aren't as good made in a small (pot) quantity, but I'm loving this one."
5.0,So Delicious!,"I love this mac and cheese more than any other mac and cheese flavor. I love it so much i just bought the 24 pack for a 1 person household, since they don't sell this in many stores. This is quick and easy to make, and if you sprinkle in a little garlic salt you a good to go! get some now."
5.0,They got the mustard sardine thing right with these!,"Hint, if you don't like them cold, microwave them for a few seconds and take the chill off.  The taste sensation then is very different.  Firm sardines with a very balanced mustard sauce!  That's about it.  Nice job Crown Prince!"
5.0,Good buy for your money,"I use this almond flour to bake French Macarons, and this is just fine! It's a good quality and far cheaper than anything else I have found on the market until now."
1.0,Strawberry Twizzlers just aweful,"I've never had these before, and I'll never buy them again. They were disgusting, did not taste very good, texture was terrible, I thought I was eating plastic! I threw the whole lot out."
5.0,Yummy,"As a borderline diabetic, I can satisfy the chocolate cravings without guilt.  These bars are tasty.  I have subscribed to all the flavors, but chocolate is my favorite.  These are not dry, but instead, live up to their fudge name.  I take a bar to work for breakfast and surprisingly it keeps me satisfied until lunch.  At first, I was doubtful a little bar could do that, but these bars succeed.  Every time I unwrap a bar and take that first bite, my thought is, ""These are GOOD FOR ME???"".  I recommend trying these if you are diabetic, borderline diabetic, or just want something healthy and tasty to snack on."
5.0,So long Starbucks!,I was recently turned on to Starbucks Green Tea Frappichino. I found out what they used to make them and decided to try to make them myself. This green tea tastes the same as Starbucks and now I make them at home all the time. I hope Vita Life Matcha will be around for a long time because I will keep ordering it for as long as I can!!!
1.0,don't be a sucker,"This is a ripoff.  The 40 oz box has a false layer in it to make it look like you're getting your money's worth.  Plus, Whitman has the Chinese making it's boxes.  What a disappointment."
1.0,Pellegrino Review,"For a number of years, I have purchased Pellegrino by the case at, Costco.  I have three problems with Pellegrino:  (1) I don't know how much a bottle used to hold, but to me it seems that the bottles over the years have decreased in size, it seems like the company slimmed down the bottle to hold less water.  I am certain the price didn't decrease.  (2) Just recently, I purchased a case and found the seal on the bottles so insufficient that I have had to pour out all the contents of a newly opened bottle, no fizz. Just this weekend I had to pour out the water in two brand new bottles.  (3) If I do have a newly opened bottle that is fizzy, I've also noticed that the bottle tops do not hold the fizz for long after the bottle has been opened, say only a few days in the fridge.  I usually replace the Pellegrino top by recycling a lid from a plastic Coke bottle.  I have heard that the store, ShopRite has a nice store-named product that is imported from Italy and tastes like Pellegrino. I'm switching.  (Let's hope ShopRite keeps the cost reasonable, keeps bottle size the same, and has a better lid.)"
5.0,Best dog food ever.,My Australian Cattle dog is allergic to EVERYTHING. We started feeding her the Taste of the Wild brand and she has been the happiest dog ever  since we switched. There is no other like it anywhere. I am so grateful to the people who make this food. It is the ONLY food I will buy.
1.0,Tough and Stale,Even though the granola bars were months from expiring they seem stale. I wonder if they were stored in an over-heated warehouse. I've had much better.
1.0,bait and switch,"The box shows just plain lasagna and what I got was Italian.  I do not like the Italian and can get it at any local store.  I ordered it because I wanted the plain old fashioned lasagna, not Italian. Now I can't even contact anyone to try to tell them what happened.  Returns are not allowed on food, even if they show one thing and send you something else.  Now I am stuck with a product I will not use.  Don't care for bait and switch or a customer service group you can't reach.  I will be very careful what I order or not order again."
5.0,Excellent for cats with grain sensitivity,"After adopting my cat, I noticed fairly quickly that he spent a lot of time sneezing and coughing, and would sometimes have asthma attacks. (Yes, feline asthma is a thing.) I did some research online and found many suggestions that grain-free food can help control feline asthma. I first tried Blue Buffalo's grain free line, and that kibble was good for some months, but I also wanted to feed wet food, and their canned ""Wilderness"" line didn't seem to agree with my cat's sensitive stomach. At that point, I switched to Before Grain, both wet and dry, and my cat has thrived on it. He also has only had one or two asthma attacks in the past year, as opposed to at least one every few weeks before switching to grain-free food.  I think the important thing to realize is that all cats will react differently to different foods. What works for one won't work for another, and it might take trying several different brands or even flavors within a brand to find the food that is best for your cat.  However, I do purchase the dry food at the local Petco rather than online. It is cheapest there. The wet food cases, however, are about equivalent in price, so I buy them here on Amazon."
5.0,The BEST tuna I've ever eaten!,"Thought I would try this tuna after reading the reviews.  The price is very reasonable and with delivery to my door, I love this.  I think I'm going to be loving subscribe and save. No shipping fee, bulk items delivered to my door (I live in a high rise condo) I'm a customer for as long as Amazon keeps the system.  Fab tuna. You HAVE to try it."
5.0,Cure for sore throats,"For about 5 years, especially during the winter months, I used to come down with several very painful sore throats, many of which would escalate into strep throat or a sinus infection.  I haven't had one since I started drinking Kukicha tea 2 years ago.  It's isn't carried in many stores so I'm glad I can get it through Amazon now and that it's eligible for free shipping.  I'm not a doctor and this isn't medical advice, but if you are having a problem with sore throats this is worth a shot."
5.0,"Very fast, very tasty","These crackers are absolutely delicious, whether you are a celiac or not. The order arrived on time and was in perfect condition."
5.0,Pamelas baking & Pancake Mix,This is a great product..I am not allergic to any foods but am looking at eating healthier and found that this product is delicious..Also love the Pamela's Bread Mix and recieve that monthly.
5.0,Great!,"These bars are really good as a snack on-the-go or even as a sweet treat after meals. I've just recently started diving into the organic and health food market, and so far I'm impressed. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like these bars - organic is one thing, but ""raw"" seemed like another. I've been used to that certain taste of sugar and additives that usally go along with snack bars like these, and thought for sure the difference was going to be a lot bigger. Certainly, it tastes a bit different, but it's a different, REAL* food taste that I can get used to. These bars have the necessary sweetness that cover up the fact that these things are actually kind of good for you. From one junk food lover to another, these things are great!"
1.0,clumpy Rocks,Wellll...not so good is what I would rate this product. I bought 4 containers for a client gift. The expiration date was past the expiration....which was evident because the candy came stuck together within each package. I tried to salvage what I could because I didnt leave myself enough time for error.
5.0,health foods,"this almond flour is a delicious way of adding more fiber to your diet. it has a natural sweetness to its flavor palate, I use it to make crusts with, and is also gluten free. arrives in a heavy plastic bag, and is just a wonderful product."
1.0,No taste,"Very unhappy with this purchase.  There was essentially no taste.  The crust was basically flour with a little salt added, the ingredients on the inside of the bread tasted mass-produced.  Combined with the extremely high shipping costs, this is a very poor product.  If they sent me another one for free I would put it in the trash, it is just not worth eating."
5.0,GREAT TASTING CHOCOLATE!,"Nestle Milk Chocolate 24 Bars, The Great tasting and smooth Chocolate as what I always remember of Nestle. They Know how to make Chocolate, they have been doing it since the late 1800's, the Company largely responsible for making Chocolate Chip Cookies. I have it often for a snack and I also use it to make Chocolate Curls with the help of a vegetable Peeler, the Milk Chocolate Bar has to be at room temperature if too cold it won't work, I then apply the Chocolate Curls to Cakes and decorate Pies for a touch of Style from a Great Tasting Milk Chocolate Bar. Thank You"
1.0,WARNING--DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS!,"I hate to give a bad review since I have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production (which is why I purchased it). I just feel the need to share that I took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction. It was 2am and I went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts (and chickpeas). This is not marked anywhere on the label, on Amazon's page, or on Nature's Way's website."
5.0,orange flower water,"After trying to find this product in liquor stores, etc. found it at Amazon.com.  And what a bargin too!  So much more product for so much less money.  A great way to shop. C L"
5.0,Love it!!,I make virgin mango mojitos with it!!! Its sooooo good! But you have to buy the mojito mix with it also from Monin! Yummm
5.0,British cuppa,"They right amount of tea in the bag for a true cuppa tea, british style. Wait for it on sale. I decided might as well spend the money and get a good tea you enjoy."
5.0,"Good as toddler food, too","I chill these and give to my toddler.  It works for that, too, and she loves them.  I'm glad to be getting some pumpkin in her that she otherwise wouldn't eat.  The only flavor she doesn't like of the Plum brand is the spinach/peas/pears."
1.0,GRINDS WAAY TOOO SMALL INTO A POWDER RATHER THAN LITTLE CHUNKS LIKE I WANTED!,REALLY DO NOT LIKE THESE!  THEY GRIND WAAY TOOO SMALL INTO A POWDER .. YET I REALLY WANTED TO HAVE THE CINNAMON GROUND INTO SMALL PIECES INSTEAD!  ANY CHANCE OF GETTING A REFUND FOR THE 2ND UNOPENED BOTTLE?
1.0,Ewwwwwww,"Tastes like a REALLY watered down bitter flat/re-carbonated grape soda.  I think that the taste factor has to do with the fact that this is 50% juice and 60 calories, while the other ""regular"" V8 Fusion flavors such as Strawberry Banana, Pomegranate Blueberry, and Concord Grape Raspberry are 100% juice and about 120 calories. The other flavors taste a million times better than this! I don't have the slightest clue how this got past any human taste testers."
5.0,Awesome!,Kids love them and it's an awesome value!!! These will last a long time. Perfect for a large family always on the go.
5.0,Absolutely Delicious!,This spice mix is absolutely fantastic. It gives a lot of heat and a ton of flavor to anything you put it on or in. I use it as a spice rub on turkeys when i'm to lazy to make my own (which is often) and it's great. It gives a wonderful dark color to the bird and tastes great. Highly recommend!
5.0,Hooked on thinkThin bars,"After sampling the chunky peanut bars at the VIP tent of the Big Sur Marathon ,I searched the web to find them. Amazon had the best price, so I ordered several boxes, taking advantage of free shipping offer. They are a delicious meal replacement, or an after-exercise treat,composed of 20% protein while remaining fat and sugar free. They are soft and moist, unlike other peanut butter chocloate bars."
5.0,yummy,"These are excellent tasting olives. They came in one huge bag that I opened and stored in 3 large glass containers and popped in the fridge. I do not know how long they will stay fresh, because they came with a small amount of liquid. But at the rate they are eaten, that should not matter."
5.0,Very strong!,"This honey is much stronger than any other honey I've ever tried. It has a very nice smell and taste, and, by nature of being stronger, doesn't require as much for flavoring things such as teas.  I very much enjoyed this product with Chamomile tea while I had strep throat (and later an upper respiratory infection and then pneumonia). Honey is great for a sore throat, and it also has some anti-biotic properties that I attribute to very diminished symptoms (compared to family members who were also sick). Unfortunately for them, they are not big fans of herbal tea and honey ;)  I will definitely be ordering again, although these 6 bottles will last a while."
5.0,It's a kicking coffee,I love Lavazza and tried this on a whim and it's delicious.  I use the modern day percolator to make my cup of coffee in the morning and this coffee is perfect for this kind of brewing.  I have never used it in a drop machine.
1.0,What You See Is Not What You Get,"I ordered this item based on the title (StarKist Chunk Light Tuna LUNCH TO GO Pouch), the photo and the description saying it includes 6 crackers, serving spoon, napkin and a mint.  What I got were pouches of STARKIST CHUNK LIGHT TUNA.  Period.  No crackers.  No spoon.  No napkin.  And no mint.  Obviously, someone erred somewhere.  I ordered two sets with one-day shipping, so I'm out $43.  I'd return them but that's too much hassle for this merchandise.  I'll eat the tuna but I'll have to buy some crackers to enjoy them as the product page promises."
1.0,From someone who grew up on coconut milk/water!!!!!,"I ordered two to try out from Amazon but while waiting on the delivery, I was out shopping when I observed a lot of companies were suddenly cashing out on coconut milk/water! I bought one brand-name from Lucky's Super Market and another brand from Walgreen's next door. Being of Polynesian heritage and homegrown from the islands but living on the mainland, I thought, ""Hmmm..all these centuries coconuts been around, suddenly its being pitched as nutritional & interesting. Let's see what the catch is"". Finally, VitaCoCo came. I tasted it and spit it right out. It didnt taste like coconut water to our family 'at all', not even from an over-ripe coconut. Then I looked to see where it was produced. Before I go further let me explain something to those who may not know. Agriculture for fruits are always better on tropical islands, or from the Caribbean islands. You won't find any fruits more richer in juice or sweeter anywhere else in the world. Vita CoCo says it is produced by a company in Latin America, Brazil. Produced for All Markets Inc. New York, NY.  My sister then poured some into a glass and screamed, ""OMG They're ripping people off! It's watered down!"" She said that because pure coconut milk has a milky color to it. Some less, some more but never crystal clear. The younger the fruit, the richer, more nutritional, and milky the coconut milk. The more mature the fruit, the sweeter & thinner the milk. As the fruit ripens the coconut water gets converted into the solid meat of the fruit. The meat then becomes more nutritional then the milk. So I told her that they weren't ripping consumers off because it says, 100% pure coconut WATER. It's either a little coconut milk diluted with a lot of pure water, or this is what Brazilian coconuts taste like. And it seems like they're using 'over-riped' coconuts. Which makes sense. Then they could also market the meat of the coconut.  As for those who have to have potassium every night like my aunt, DO NOT rely on Vita Coco's ad. My aunt finished off the 17 fl oz of Vita CoCo and still woke up with painful side effects from taking prednisone. This is also how we know Vita CoCo is using over-ripe less nutritional coconuts, or watering it down. I ended up having to prepare her daily one banana she's suppose to have before bedtime. Drink mango or guava juice all! The most nutritional of all island fruits ;)"
1.0,WARNING ---> MADE IN CHINA!,"I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.  I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese ""treats"""
5.0,My Morning Coffee,As this was an anniversary gift from my husband I was looking forward to the first cup.. I loved it and will be looking for more of the same!
5.0,cow ears dog chews,"Great product for the busy dog.  Good for their teeth, and they don't swell when wet like rawhide products.  They arrive individually wrapped which seems to keep the  dirt and bugs off."
1.0,Watered Down,This product used to be my favorite. Now it has just become watered down. Sad! I would recommend looking for a different product.
5.0,Works very well with Toddy cold brew system,"I use the Toddy cold brew system and some coffee does not work so well, either it's hard to filter out or just does not taste very good. This worked fine in the brewer, filtered out qickly and most imprtant tastes really good. I've never had Community Coffee before, but I liked this."
1.0,Trash! Don't waste your meony,I just got these items. They were as hard as the leather. And I could not return these items. Don't waste your money. They are trash.
5.0,Gluten Free Pie Crusts!,"Great product for those of us who like pies and thought they would never be able to eat them again!  This product makes a great flaky crust.  Measure the ingredients carefully to make sure you are not adding too much butter, etc.  Add the water a little at a time.  The crusts can be difficult to roll out if they are too wet.  I usually make all four crusts at one time and freeze the extras.  I've found that the crusts are better when baked before adding the pie filling.  I honestly don't think that anyone would be able to tell that this is not a traditional pie crust."
1.0,FLAVORED COFFEE??,Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!
5.0,the best instant coffee,"I initially tasted this coffee this past summer when my daughter returned from a volunteer teaching trip in Tanzania.I was amazed at the delicious flavor for instant coffee as I have never found an instant coffee that I enjoyed.Now that our supply is diminished,its nice to know we can order more thru Amazon."
1.0,Extremely Disappointed,"If I could have given less than 1 star I would have. The candy is bone dry and rock hard. It's grainy not smooth with white stuff in the middle. There is no breaking pieces off this or biting it, you need a hammer or chisel. The sell by date is July 20, so it should have been ok. Which makes believe the sell buy date is bogus. I just spent $85 for 24 ounces that isn't even fit for maple sugar. I've contacted the company, and I'm waiting to hear back from them. I don't know if I got a defective batch, but these are a supreme disappointment. I like the idea of no additives, but what good is that if it's not edible? Someone else posted ""melt in your mouth"", when I put it in my mouth, it doesn't dissolve and if I suck on it, it's so hard it leaves cuts in my mouth.  ABC Wholesale did get back to me. They do not honor the products they sell. They told me to contact the manufacturer. I am now waiting to hear back from the manufacturer. ABC Wholesale sent me another email stating they are not responsible for any quality issue of the candy and that the normal texture of the candy is hard and dry. They were very rude.  I got an email from the manufacturer. The product is not supposed to be hard and dry. They told me they do not sell to ABC Wholesale and are not sure where they get their product so cannot guarantee it's freshness if you buy from them. I checked the link on Coombs Family Farm to buy the candy and ABC Wholesale is what comes up. So the person giving me information from the manufacturer obviously doesn't even know who they sell to. They also told me they would send me a replacement package. It's been two weeks and I haven't received anything from them.  ABC Wholesale and Coombs Family Farm are selling an inferior product with extremely low quality and zero customer service.  I have bought maple sugar candy from 2 other sources here on amazon. Sweet Vermont - which was good - firm and melt in your mouth. And Manfield Maple - which was even better - glazed/crisped on the outside and creamy on the inside. Mansfield also has no additives. They are less than half the price of Coombs Family Farm. They each only took two days to deliver the product to me."
5.0,Tastes Really Good!,"I like it. Stronger than most coffee, so use less. Easier on the stomach, and doesn't give head ache like some cheaper coffee sometimes does. It's a well balance premium coffee that is worth paying more money for, because it is so much better. Since I can't afford it, I only buy it occasionally and when it's on sale."
1.0,Much too sweet!,I could not believe how very sweet this is. Made my teeth rattle. I have given it away to other users of K-cups.  I have not gotten a response as of yet. I guess it would be great for people that have a sweet tooth.
1.0,old stuff,if you can eat 4 boxes in two days there ok. i will never buy again!!!!!
5.0,One Happy Customer!,"I won't repeat what the last reviewer wrote, I would simply like to say that this gum WORKS! It makes my teeth feel really clean for hours even without brushing! You know that feeling when you REALLY need to brush your teeth, because your teeth are kinda aching? Well, this gum eliminates this feeling altogether! One downside is that the sweetness/flavor of the gum runs out pretty quick, much faster than gum made with artificial sweeteners. But, it is fantastic for what it is, a dental gum! Highly recommended!!!!"
5.0,i love the little suckers..,"thou i believe rumor has it they are as GMO laced as you can imagine. Nonetheless, i cannot tell you how good they taste.. Only in america have i heard of the 2+ kilo pack, and much cheaper than they come in stores in Europe. Caveat: they are extremely addictive.."
5.0,My cat loved this,Since Amazon is the only place I can find the Trout I bought a whole case and my cat devoured it. She is a very happy girl. Thanks Amazon
1.0,McVittie supplier,"McVitties Digestive Biscuits are the best cookie in the whole world. This supplier sent me fresh product, but mostly crumbs."
1.0,DONT BUY,"baby food canisters arrived in dirty containers, half of which were actually OPEN!!!! Yes The seal was broken!!!! if you love your baby then buy elsewhere."
5.0,I absolutely *love* Grapefruit MASH!,"I bought this on a whim at Newark airport, and wow, seriously delicious!  I'm a serious beverage freak--I try them all and I make my own all the time using fresh/condensed/frozen juices, simple syrups, seltzers, various sodas, herbs, etc. MASH is excellent! Then I tried to find where it's sold....not so much luck, and even though it's really, really, really tasty, I'm not going to buy it online!"
1.0,Something is not right with this coffee,"When I first got the pods I loved them but after a couple of weeks in opened or unopened packages these pods must have lost their freshness because the coffee does is just not the same and it's pretty much awful at this point, I am sorry I went ahead and purchased 160 more pods after the first 36 because now I'm stuck with them and I can't stomach them nor can anyone in my family."
1.0,Where's the Apricot?,"I really wanted to enjoy this tea:  great aroma and lots of fruit chunks (like a tea ""trail mix"").  Don't understand how something that smells so much like apricot when dry doesn't taste like apricot when prepared as tea.  I found this rather bland as a hot tea and more on the sweet side when iced.  In my book for apricot tea, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf apricot ceylon still rules."
1.0,Picky Cavalier didn't like them,We have a picky Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with some digestive issues and he did not like these at all.
5.0,Awesome!,Package was shipped perfectly and we recieved it extremely quick. Would definitely purchase this product again! Thanks for the peanuts!
5.0,Great Bar!,These are really tasty and an organic product that is both low in carbs and quite filling. Quite affordable If you are a peanut butter freak you will love these bars!
5.0,A Good Thing to Have on Hand,"I bought the tea sampler for my Keurig coffee maker, and they are good to have for the non-coffee drinkers that come by.  I have also found it to be a nice way to make a quick cup of tea for my kids."
1.0,Buyer Beware!!,"I really like Bentley tea, it has a very subtle taste, not like Celestial Seasonings that is so strong. BUT, the little piece of paper that is used for dunking in the hot water sticks to the bag, which causes it to rip. I have had to throw away 3/4 of the box and all three boxes were the same. What a waste."
5.0,Healthy Fuel When You're on the Go,"I am addicted to the Think Thin bars. I have Celiac's Disease (gluten intolerance) so quick, on the go food is not always easy to find for me. The Think Thin bars help alleviate that problem by offering practically a whole meal in a bar. I ALWAYS have them on me when I travel, or when I'm having a busy day running to and from meetings, and often eat them for breakfast on a regular day, too. I was at first concerned by the long list of hard-to-pronounce ingredients, but my Naturopathic doctor friend told me that most of those were just scientific names for B vitamins. I love the crunchy peanut butter the best, but a friend of mine said that I need to try the white chocolate ones as well. Love these bars!"
1.0,Waste of Money,"This bulk box seems to be defective. I know my Equal, and this stuff just doesn't measure up! I did a side by side comparsion with some I had already (purchased from Walmart recently). The Bulk box Equal wasn't as white and it just didn't sweeten. I suspected it was old, but the outside of the bulk box said it doesn't expire until 2014. If its not too old, it's possible  these packets had a hard life. They could have been exposed to too much heat. Aspartame looses its sweetness with heat."
5.0,The best creamy havarti ever!,"I have always been picky with my cheese ever since I was little. However, I was once convinced to tried Dofino's creamy havarti and havn't looked back since. This cheese is good with just about anything you can put cheese on. My favorite way to use this cheese is to spread it on crackers. It makes a delicious snack. I get it at my local grocery store and it is always very fresh. Oh and a warning, I tried a cheaper version of creamy havarti cheese from my supermarket and it was awful so make sure you get the Dofino brand."
1.0,Please don't waste your money.,I tried rinsing them.  I tried eating them.  I threw out the whole thing.  The smell is pretty brutal and the texture is like that of rubber worms.
1.0,Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds,"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch would have been better, or no salt at all."
1.0,"Don't know what it tastes like, the package was busted and the content all out","I was looking forward to it, but because of poor packaging got it in a bad condition. Should I give it another chance?"
5.0,Excellent Dilmah Earl Gray,If you are a tea lover this is the one for you. Lots of flavor and excellent color. Best Earl Gray tea.
1.0,Couldn't stand the texture,I can eat just about anything but these noodles smelled like fish as soon as I opened the package. I tasted absolutely no garlic or herb...didn't even smell it! The texture was unbearable and they made me nauseated all afternoon. I have some of the plain angel hair pasta so I'm going to try those but I'm probably giving them to my brother who said he will at least try them.
1.0,packaging problem,I just opened the outer layer of the box and got baking powder everywhere! The plastic packages that contain the powder are broken. I can't return it due to Amazon policy. Few days later: Amazon sent me a new package for free. This one was in good shape.
5.0,Great flavor and texture,We really enjoy this rice and purchase it whenever and wherever we can find it. It's worth the effort for the nice nutty flavor is an enjoyable change from our normal basmati.
5.0,Perfect for the Black and Decker Single Serve coffee maker!,"First of all, I am a Kenyan coffee lover and this coffee is delicious!  It was my first time using the coffee pods, but these do not disappoint!  I used them with my Black and Decker single serve coffee maker (using two pods as the directions suggested) and they fit inside and brewed perfectly! Definitely recommend generally and for use with this coffee maker.  They are the small size, which is what was needed.  Thanks!"
1.0,Dont even think about it,"I belong to  a part of India where coconut is part of our staple diet. After moving to the US I had almost given up on the thought of drinking coconut water everyday. Prohibitive costs and availability being the primary reasons. When I saw this deal, i was really happy and ordered it immediately. The first packet came in July, my concierge who collected the packet called me immediately stating there was a leak in the box that had arrived. To my relief only one of the packs had a small leak. The packs were good sized and i knew  instantly that i had a months supply of coconut water. When i chilled it and tasted it, I had mixed views, while it had  distinctive sweet flavor, there was certainly an aftertaste probably coz of the packing. Anyway i developed a taste for it and it was a good month. The shipping of the second package was announced late july. I was later notified that the package had been damaged during shipping. I was refunded my money and no package was sent for the month of august. I received an intimation about the packet for September arriving in late august. Again, it was the same story replayed. My concierge called me to tell me the packet is leaking. I rush down to see this time not 1 but 3 packs are damaged. I decide to return the pack, and i get notified by amazon that i cannot return the product. Well i have cancelled the subscription and now a happy amazon prime customer is dejected with their level of service."
5.0,DELICIOUS!!!,"Seriously, this stuff is really really good. Not kidding one bit. And odd item to be sure, but delicious.  Just don't get the stains on your three wolf moon shirt."
1.0,Coming from a hunter...,"I've hunted deer nearly all of my life, and I can say without a doubt, this is the worst jerky I've ever had.  I've had both wild & farm-raised venison, and this doesn't even compare.  I don't know how to describe the taste, but there is something very sweet about it.  Tangy, sweet, sour....whatever it is, it's not just venison.  It's almost like they barbecued the jerky.  Again, whatever it is, I won't be ordering it again."
5.0,Huge Value and Fresh,These almonds arrived in a clear plastic bag and every almond was perfect.  I transfered most to a vacuum container to preserve freshness. I will reorder from this company.
1.0,Disappointed to say the least,"I have been an avid Celestial tea drinker for a number of years and this by far was a favorite of mine, until they changed it.   Not only did the company decide to package it differently , they have also added a blend of white tea in it. In my opinion they ruined a perfectly good product.   The tea itself seems weaker to me, not smoother. For the past year, this tea, prior to the change, was difficult to find in my local grocery store.  I purchased it online and was fully satisfied until the last shipment arrived and the new tea was sent. Needless to say, I won't be buying this again unless the company returns back to the original , which was superior to this by far.   Why oh why can't companies leave things alone? New does not necessarily mean better and in this case it rings true."
1.0,"Dry, dry, dry",I looked forward to amazing popcorn... Instead what I received was the driest popcorn I ever made.  We went back to Orville's which actually tastes better!  This was a total waste of money.
1.0,Not the same tea,"I had purchased the small boxes of this tea at my local market and thought it is the best Earl Grey tea ever.  So, I ordered the 100 count from Amazon.  While the packaging on the individual bags looks very similar, this is not the same tea; it  the worst tea I have ever had, with a strong unpleasant taste and does not taste like Earl Grey.  I am very disappointed and feel very ripped off."
5.0,Tasty goodness,Being a Acid refluxer this stuff is great right after dinner. I noticed it helped me considerably so I came on here and got the 6 boxes for cheap.
1.0,Good product but order short,I order 160 K-cups and received 9 boxes of 16...One box short.  I tried to return the order so that I could get the correct number of boxes.  The site indicated no returns allowed for this product.  I could not find a way to get Amazon's attention to correct the problem.
1.0,Disappointed,The coffee did not taste like it was fresh.  The coffee tasted as if it was brewed from stale coffee beans.  I was very disappointed because I expected a good cup of coffee coming from Brooklyn which is where I am from.  I regularly drink Starbucks coffee and have been pleased with all of their varieties I have tried ranging from Verona to the blonde Veranda. These brands taste like fresh brew which is what I look for in a cup of coffee. I will not order from this company again.
5.0,Wonderful,"While the fat in peanut butter is not all that bad for you, the calories can add up when trying to lose weight.  This powder was surprisingly good.  Mixed with the water on the directions, it tasted wonderful.  No added sugars, and minus the fat.  Great for smoothies, and drinks where you want that flavor without the calories.  I will be ordering again, and trying it in some recipes.  Only negative is that the 6.5 oz can is very small, and I will be buying a larger one next time."
1.0,Ick!,"Terrible! Overwhelming fake, gross blueberry flavor. My wife bought a box of this for me to take to the shared Keurig machine in my office. Of the 18 cups, only 4 were tasted. None of those cups was finished. No one will use the remaining cups, even when desperate for coffee. Avoid."
1.0,Sad snack product,"I've had cheddar cheese puffs from a different manufacturer that were so inconsistent from one batch to another it made me wonder how companies get away with it, but this beats them all. I love snacks like this, I just didn't like this particular product - at all. It appears they use artificial coloring though they say they don't; the fries are thin; the fries break easily; the fries lack any discernable real cheese flavor and are so full of air, they're just like cheese puffs in potato fry shape. And poor tasting puffs at that, but I said that already. Avoid, despite the attractive price. There's nothing organic in it either, so the price should be even lower than what it already is."
5.0,If You Like Cheesy...,If you like a lot of cheese flavor is this for you!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and really enjoyed it.  I'll buy more.
5.0,another kashi winner,"great cereal.  my 18 month old daughter likes these everyday for breakfast or as a trail mix with raisins, cherries and/or m&m's .  its a shame that they don't sell them in a smaller quantity though, 6 boxes takes up an awful lot of storage space."
5.0,Grove square k cups,"I ordered three different flavors for a birthday gift to go along with the Keurig brewer.  I tried the caramel, hot chocolate, and hazelnut, and they were all excellent.  Rich in flavor and very easy to use.  I am going to buy a Keurig now.  The whole purchase was great.  I will be buying from them again."
5.0,Fantastic,These are a great alternative to chips.  I wasn't sure how they would be based on other reviews but I am glad I bought them and wish I would of found them sooner.  I have twin 18 month olds and they can't get enough of them.  I like them too!
5.0,Awesome Altoids!,"Just when I thought Ginger altoids had been dicontinued!  Whew!  Thankfully you can find just about anything online!  Hooray!  I was very pleased to purchase an entire case of Ginger Altoids.  Now I have plenty for my friends and me!  These are the best for curing car sickness, indigestion or just freshening your breath.  Beware!  Many claim the flavor is just too ""Curiously"" strong for them.  I, on the other hand, can not get enough of them.  Thanks Altoids!  Love them!"
1.0,smelled bad enough to not try it,"I admit I didn't actually eat any of this. As I was opening the can, I caught a whiff and immediately checked the expiration date ...good to 2014.  I went ahead and finished opening the can.  Yup still stank.  There were a lot of strips of fat in the can, which I've never seen in canned salmon before; I'm not saying that's bad, it's probably good for you, but I've never seen it, and combined with how horribly it smelled I just threw it away.  A lot of it is personal preference, but I've eaten my fair share of canned salmon, but common sense told me I should cut my loss with this, rather than suffer through a horrible lunch or risk getting sick."
5.0,Nutritious and Wholesome Cat Food for a Picky Older Cat,"I have been at my wit's end trying to find a good cat food for my 15 year old cat, Lily. She is finicky and even worse, has a delicate stomach condition. Not only do we get the usual hairballs, but I've had to clean up after her about three times a day.  As a result, we're very careful in how we feed her. In terms of dry food, we've given her IAMS and Science Diet. After a brief honeymoon period, she wouldn't touch the stuff (Science was very expensive, so I learned my lesson there, pricey doesn't mean Lily will like it). In terms of wet foods, she likes Fancy Feast Classic but never manages to finish a can. There's always leftover meat in her bowl.  Then I gave her Nature's Variety. The first time I served it, she lapped it up. In fact, she licked her bowl clean, not a speck of food left! I was also surprised to see tiny bits of an orange-colored vegetable in her food (carrot?). Since I'm a bit of a vegetarian myself, I highly approve of the 5% veggies that come in this type of canned food. I'm also glad that this grain-free food is a pate, which makes it perfect for older cats like Lily.  She's been eating this non-stop for about two weeks now (still licking the bowl clean!) and so far so good(fingers crossed). Fancy Feast seemed to be the only type of food she liked, so I'm happy to be able to add this to the list."
5.0,We LOVE this rice!,We LOVE this rice!  It's a good price & so much better than the last bulk bag we bought somewhere (maybe SAMS Club?).  We put this on auto-order to get the discount.
1.0,Too salty for me.,"This item came well packaged, and arrived in a timely manner after I ordered it, so I do appreciate that fact.  However, it was way too salty for me.  It was also quite overpoweringly 'fishy' - duh! - but I had thought that perhaps the spices and smoking would provide a less fishy taste, while adding some additional good taste to the salmon.  I did not taste the spices or smoking at all, just fish and salt.  Not to my taste, I'm afraid."
1.0,It's Terrible.,"Do you remember what it smells like to add water to an ashtray full of cigarettes? That's how this coffee tastes. I added a caramel, some hazelnut flavoring, a packet of hot chocolate with miniature marshmellows, and Coffeemate vanilla chai creamer too it. It still tasted bitter, like wet cigarettes and metallic. I think the metallic flavor comes from the t-disc packaging. It doesn't make sense to buy a $100 coffee maker and drink trashy coffee. Especially when you can take that same amount of cash and buy some good coffee. I ignored the bad ratings of other reviewers because I believed the positive reviews. The only redeeming factors are that it is cheaper (less than $7 at Walmart), and that you can make a single cup of coffee. If it were allowed, I'd give it a -5 rating (or   -,  for infinitly horrible)."
5.0,Great pick me up!,"My husband and I take a couple of these ""cookies"" along when we bike.  Mid-way we stop for our energy break.  I'm so happy to have found these delicious, healthy cookies on Amazon."
1.0,WORST CHEESE SAUCE I'VE HAD,I purchased this product at a local grocery store on sale and it was horrible. It literally tastes and smells like vomit. Don't waste good chips on this stuff you'd be better off eating chips plain than ruining your taste buds with this dip! I am a huge cheese eater and I could not stomach it...and that is saying a lot! How did this product pass inspection?
5.0,LOVE IT!,"I've never tried this brand so wasn't sure how ""flavored"" it would be.  It is smooth, cinnamony.. with a hint of nut and vanilla. Excellent and tastes fresh.  I put the other three bags in the freezer even though they are vacuum sealed for freshness. I also got a great deal on the coffee by buying it from the amazon warehouse :)"
1.0,Terrible! The cups were empty!,"I was so disappointed!  I received the cups and tried one right away.  It was like hot water.  The cups felt empty so I opened one to see.  The ""cider"" had melted or something, causing the cups to be empty.  I thought maybe one or two could be bad, but it was the whole box!  Soooo disappointed!"
5.0,LOVE this lava cake!,We love this lava cake but can not locate it at stores locally.  We are so glad we can get it on Amazon.  We always serve it with ice cream-yummy!  It's the best dessert ever!!
1.0,Blue Monkey 100% coconut water (pack of 24),"I assumed you guys get some proof from suppliers that they are honest with how they pitch their products.  Not a bit of coconut water taste.  Wondering where this water came from, used 23cans to water my house plants. Good they did not die. Will never buy this product again."
1.0,An abomination,"I've been enjoying different Hamburger Helper varieties for many years now. Some people don't like it much, but I find some of them really good (particularly the stroganoff kind.) Saw this in the store recently and decided to give it a try... Cheesy hash brown Hamburger Helper is an utter abomination. RUN, don't walk, from this kind! Difficult to cook properly & tastes like a wretched abortion at the end of the process. The absolute WORST Hamburger Helper variety I've ever had. We barely touched it for dinner that night & it took days for the critters to completely scavenge it out of our backyard. Just say ""no"" to this ""product!"""
5.0,"great product, worth every penny","I've struggled with sleep and muscle tension for years and was introduced to this power powder by a great friend (thanks hil!) who said it worked for her.  From day one, it's worked incredibly well.  I don't feel drugged or sedated, just relaxed.  I agree that it's pretty sweet and strong as far as flavor, but hey, I can deal!  Careful: it does fizz up quite a bit and can easily overflow a glass if left unchecked.  I'm really thankful to have this product as a natural alternative to the myriad of pharmacological sleep aids.  No dependence, no withdrawal, just great, relaxed, restful sleep.  Mazel tov, Natural Calm!!"
1.0,FIRE HAZARD!,"I bought the Kettle Corn variety Pop-Up Bowl. The first bag I tried to pop totally burned within 12 seconds (with smoke pouring out of the microwave), well before it was even fully popped, and the second bag, which I set on a lower temperature (even though it specifically says to use HIGH) actually caught on fire! Avoid this fire trap product at all costs. To avoid throwing all the rest of the bags out, I settled for cutting the bags open, scraping the contents into a heavy, lidded-skillet, and cooking it old-school. Those came out fine, as there's nothing the matter with the popcorn, just the packaging. So, unless you have a desire to destroy a perfectly good microwave, and possibly burn down your house in the process, avoid this packaging at all costs. Mark my words, this is going to come up in the future. The Orville Redenbacher brand is going to see lawsuits for this one! I wanted to give it ZERO STARS, but the program wouldn't let me! Be forewarned!"
1.0,Wish I Had Known,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this product.  I was expecting an assortment of flavored COFFEE, but instead I only got 11 flavored coffee, one decaf, and the rest was hot chocolate and cappuccino.  I even searched through several products before I settled on this one because there was NOTHING about hot chocolate or cappuccino in the description. I will not buy from this seller again."
5.0,A Whole New Life!,"This stuff is WONDERFUL!!!  It has a slightly different taste than peanut butter, but for those with food allergies (or living in a house with someone with food allergies) this is as close to peanut butter that we've ever gotten!  The kid with the peanut allergy is SO incredibly happy to bring her WOW butter sandwiches to school.  The rest of the family is so happy I can make dessert treats that taste like peanut butter (wow butter shakes, wow butter cookies,...)"
1.0,Amazon sent expired bottles!,"I ordered this after a friend told me about it.  The product is great but don't buy it on Amazon because (like many other reviews) they sent me bottles with an expiration date of January 2011.  So, do buy this product - it's like A-1 but the thickness of catchup but, get it elsewhere!"
1.0,garbage product,It isnt even wroth being sugar free. my stomach is aching and I am getting so much gas. I would rather stick with the normal werthers. I cant believe i bought 12 bags of this crap...
1.0,Product can cause serious dental problems,"I like Kashi products overalls and loved this cereal at first. However, the consistensy is too hard. It caused, not one, but TWO major dental problems for me (a young woman in her thirties). One morning, I broke a filling eating my morning breakfast. Dismissing the problem, I then later broke a cap snacking on the cereal. Overall, my dental bill amounted to almost $2,000.  My advice is that if you have any dental work at all, like most of us in the world, avoid this particular Kashi product unless you want a very large dental bill."
1.0,Not very good,"I love ginger and I eat it all the time, but this is far to strong.  I tried to use it in a large cup with tea and it burned my throat and my wifes throat.  I threw the bag away after that."
1.0,poor packaging and customer service,"We purchased this product and the ziplock seals did not function, so there was no way to reseal the package after opening.  We tried to contact every single email address on their website and nobody at that company thought it was important enough to respond.  There are lots of organic baby products out there, and we will purchase from other companies and hope others will do the same."
1.0,Waste of money...do not buy.,"Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1.0,Truffle essense is not truffle oil,"What a disappointment, after tasting the non-truffle truffle oil I see on the list of ingredients that there is no truffle in the product. They claim a truffle aroma but it is indiscernible. Don't waste your money."
5.0,Rich and delicious,"Finding high-quality decaffeinated teas in a variety of flavors was something of a chore during my pregnancy so, naturally, I was thrilled to find this winner.  I've tried many vanilla teas, both decaffeinated and caffeinated, and it's often hard to find one with a really high-quality vanilla flavor.  This tea succeeds on all counts.  The vanilla is rich and aromatic.  Immediately upon opening the tin, the superior quality of the vanilla becomes apparent in the delicious odor.  Once brewed, this is a very rich cup that benefits from the addition of just a touch of honey or sugar to really enhance the sweetness of the vanilla.  It's delectable.  This is one tea that's worth every penny."
5.0,Great Product and outstanding price,"My wife and I love this product.  Carroll Shelby's Chili Kit is the bestwe have tried.  You are able to make your chili as hot (my wife's preference) or mild as you like.  Carroll Shelby's Chili kits are getting a little hard to find in Omaha, so getting a box of 12 from Amazon was great...and the price was quite low compared to what we pay in the store...plus free shipping as we purchased another item to get to $25.  Excellent deal...we will look for more food items as they are available on Amazon."
5.0,Perfect Tree,Not to long I receive my tree. I was surprise the tree I received is beautiful and strong. It arrived very well pack and in good health.  Lousbonsai even send me his business card and letter about taking care of your bonsai and if you have any question about the your tree.  I call him he's very helpful and  he also tell you what recommend for your tree.  I would recommend him for the next purchased in the  near future. Keep it up and very helpful.
5.0,Delicious,These are great sardines!  The olive oil is top notch and the sardines were perfect in the can. While these are filets as described and I normally like the whole fish I have to admit that these guys were very moist and of the highest quality.
1.0,Created by but not tasted by doctors,I like rockstar or gatoraide for a better choice. Picked some up and can't really force it down. Take a pass on this.
1.0,COST,These are available for much less at our local grocer. Seems like purchasing volume would make this a better deal.
5.0,Great Bonsai,"This plant arrived very quickly, perfectly packed, & looked exactly like the online photos.  I am so pleased about this purchase."
5.0,"Goodbye tangles and itchy, dry scalp...",Every summer my hair and scalp seems to get very dry which makes my scalp itchy. I've been using this Shampoo and Conditioner for a week now and I've noticed a huge improvement already. The itchiness was gone after the very first use and my hair feels so much healthier now as well.  This Conditioner sure helps in the tangle department as well.  It makes my hair tangle-free and so incredibly soft.  I've been having my 10-year-old daughter use these products as well and she keeps going around telling everybody to feel how soft her hair is now. The chlorine from the pools sure drys her hair out in the summertime but after using these products it seems to help out tons. The Conditioner sure helps those awful tangles that she's always fighting.  I wouldn't say that the scent is something to rave about but it's not bad either.  The Conditioner seems to smell a bit better than the Shampoo does.  I really like how much healthier and softer our hair is after using this product and I would recommend it.
1.0,No trust,"I oredered when the price was 4.99. But they cancelled my order without reason and any explanation.  The price was 4.99 few days ago and Now They changed for 18.46.  First e-mail  ""They were back ordered""...and Second e-mail ""they will ship one month later"" and finally they e-mail me that ""your order has been canceled. Your credit card was not charged for this order. If you're still interested in this item, please search for it again on Amazon.com.""  Obviously, They have stocks(They sell).... And what is the reason?  No trust!"
5.0,FANTASTIC,I buy these bars because they are primarily RAW! I love the taste! No preservatives!
5.0,Makes a Great PBJ Sandwich!,"So good...  Smooth and creamy.  You'll have to stir in the oil before you can use this peanut butter but the little effort is worth it.  Here's a hint: push a butter knife into the middle of the new jar of peanut butter all the way to the bottom of the jar.  Then, just move the knife a little to allow some of that surface oil to move down to the bottom of the jar.  Repeat this a couple of times and you're well on your way to having all the oil mixed in. You won't have to stir again.  Contains no hydrogenated oils and that's a health plus.  The stuff that requires NO stirring has these unhealthful oils.  I keep Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter in the refrigerator.  It is a little ""liquidy"" if kept out.  Refrigeration helps it set up a little better.  Easy to measure: if this important to you, then this is the peanut butter for you.  Taste is very nice and nutty.  I prefer a tiny bit of salt in my peanut butter and Smuckers does have some salt.  It does NOT taste salty at all, though."
1.0,Disappointed - Rate it at 0,These were not at all what I had expected and only a few of the seeds have come out - I ordered 4 of these. I am disappointed.
1.0,Good price but I wouldn't buy it,"Not a very flattering taste at all,I know that I purchased whole cashews but these taste very plain. I've had whole cashews befor elsewhere and they were far better."
5.0,coffee mix,"If this is your first time with a Kuerig coffee maker, I would recommend getting the variety coffees and teas to determine what you like. I chose my preferences from it and it was a great help."
5.0,Good product.,"I received my berries today and immediately gave them a taste. They're super delicious and have that nice crisp dried berry texture, so you know they were packaged properly. This product matches the description on amazon and is also in recyclable packaging (big plus). Next time I need a similar product I'll see if Navitas Naturals sells it."
1.0,One star for people with one brain cell...,"I ordered the chocolate mix and recieved the plain mix (with the chocolate mix packing order included of course)... One star for the people with one brain cell doing fufillment at the ""Unprepared Pantry""..."
5.0,Delicious,"I like all of the Food Should Taste Good varieties that I have tried (Multigrain, Jalapeno, Sweet Potato, and Olive). They are delicious, but also low sodium, all natural, and vegan. They are great with hummus and on their own. Unfortunately, I love them so much that I usually pig out and eat an entire bag. Local stores do not offer the single serving bags, so I decided to order them. They have the same great taste and quality as the larger bags, but I don't have to worry about going overboard."
1.0,Dog loved it Vet hates it,"the vet beleives that giving my dog this food every day made him sick. (1 year old, 12 pound yorkie) but he loves it.  I have to give away the stockpile I had."
5.0,Wow!  I'm so happy to have found these on Amazon!!,"These chow mein noodles are absolutely delicious!  They are so much better than typical ramen noodles.  The seasoning packet is a little bit sweeter, and these noodles aren't nearly as salty-tasting as the typical ramen noodles.  The seaweed also gives it an extra oomph.  The price offered through Amazon is cheaper than anywhere else I've seen.  This is a good deal!  One last thought:  I've noticed, and this goes for all the ramen noodles I've had, that adding a little bit of olive oil to the water as they cook brings out the flavor a little more.  Plus, the noodles won't glop together while trying to eat them.  In any event, these are wonderful noodles - sometimes I get on a kick and eat these noodles every day for a week or so.  These are ""gourmet"" ramen noodles.  Ha!  Please do try them!"
1.0,terrible-dont buy,"I ordered this product based on the appealing picture, and the fact that it came up as ""organic."" It is not organic, and it's not ""Granola,"" it's just baked oats with 6 pieces of dried cranberry. I counted them, 6. Nothing else. You can't return this because it's a grocery item. Terrible purchase, dont bother."
1.0,terrable cookies,I've liked other Pamela products so I figured these would be good wrong the were almost uneatable I threw them all away.
5.0,Yum!,Twinings Tea is my favorite.  I've been drinking it for approx 40 years.  This is my favorite since they discontinued Russian Caravan. The price was good and delivery prompt from this seller.  I'll be a repeat customer if they continue to sell it.
5.0,Outstanding!!!!!!!!,"This stuff is fantastic.  I hate, hate, HATE garlic but love tomato sauce.  This stuff has no garlic but is full of herbs and other wonderful flavors.  I found it at my local health food store and bought their stock.....then they ran out.  I use it for everything.  No sauce I've made has ever come close to this stuff.  YUM."
1.0,Nasty With An Aftertaste,"I love the taste of pomegranates and this had barely a hint of that taste.  I dumped the packet into my water and stirred, and stirred, and stirred...it would not completely dissolved.  The drink had an overpowering nasty flavor with a gritty/powdery texture.  I had to double the water to water down the nastiness.  The aftertaste was bad as well.  I did not notice any boost in my energy...but maybe all the extra energy was used up trying to get the taste out of my mouth."
5.0,"Wonderful tea, cute tin","Wow!  The tea is actually good, in contrast with the bland Bigelow and Twinings English Breakfast teas.  Tin is adorable; I plan to refill it with some other selections from this importer before buying another stash of Ahmad Tea.  Great gift."
1.0,Horrible flavor,"I ordered the Flavia Alterra ""Morning Roast"" coffee packs.  This is a $ 50 purchase.  I brewed one cup and practically spit it out.  The flavor was horrible.  I will never again buy food products of any kind on Amazon, because no matter what, they will not do a return on it.  And try getting Flavia to help you..... good luck with that.  The short sightedness of these 2 companies' return policy is that by refusing to make an Amazon/Flavia customer happy & do a $50 return, they now lose potentialy thousands$$$ of sales because of a negative review.  Bummer, that."
1.0,Just doesn't taste good,"This sounded really good to me, so I bought some. It doesn't taste like white chocolate--it tastes like sweet water with a weird fake sugar taste. The only use for it now is to mix with coffee for a vanilla-coffee like drink. It's awful on its own. After I bought it, everyone at the office said the same thing. I wish I'd asked around before I bought it."
1.0,Purchase Danish Butter and Danish Cookies - SEPERATELY,You can always have the satisfaction of mashing them together and enjoying the experience.  It's better than paying good money for the expected whole cookie and having them arrive completely crumbled and not fit for cereal.
5.0,Makes Great Iced Coffee!,"I had originally bought this product for hot coffee, but I heard that it dissolves in cold water and since I love iced coffee I thought I'd give it a try.  It works great for iced coffee and I no longer have to spend money on mediocre iced coffee from coffee shops.  I just put about a tablespoon of the espresso powder in a cup and add about 12 ounces of cold water.  After stirring for a minute or two, the espresso dissolves perfectly.  I add a little liquid creamer (I like to use the flavored kind so I don't have to sweeten), stir, and I have the most delicious (and easiest!) iced coffee ever.  I keep a jar of this at work and make it at the water cooler.  You may want to adjust the amounts of espresso, water, and creamer for your taste."
1.0,Did you not receive complete kit,I'm not very happy with this product.  The complete kit was not sent and this was to be a christmas gift.  Will not order from this company again unless this is quickly resolved.
1.0,Grinder failed after 21 months. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.,"I edited this review in October 2012, after my machine broke.  I bought the Saeco Vienna Plus 21 months ago to replace a much-loved and much-used Solis Master 5000. My understanding was that the Vienna Plus had basically the same internal components as my old Solis. I got over 8000 coffees out of the old Solis over the course of 8 years, before its boiler gave out. (The Solis had a digital coffee counter). I loved the Solis.  The machine had some minor problems, for example, it seems to leak water into the drip tray (I read somewhere that's a feature, not a bug), a plastic knob broke (fixed with glue), and the dosage dials stopped adjusting. A few weeks ago, however, the machine began to smell like burnt machine gears, and as it worsened, the stench now contaminates the coffee. The cost for repair would be $150 labor, plus $225 for a new grinder ($350 total). Less for a used grinder. I'm 9 months out of the 12-month warranty. We make an average of 3 espressos daily.  I would *not* have bought this machine had I known the experience I would have. I have lowered by rating from 5 stars, to 1 star. I agree with the sentiment of some other reviewers that this superautomatic machine makes most sense if you don't expect longevity. Assume a lifetime of 1-2 years.  Another point of interest, if you follow the Solis/Saeco product line, is that there is no water-level detector. The machine just runs, and if the water runs out, it times out (it does not overheat). You just refill the water tank, re-prime (e.g., run the water wand for a few seconds) and make the coffee again.  I'm replacing it with a  Breville Barista Express BES860XL Machine with Grinder , which requires an extra step when making an espresso, but after watching several videos, I think the BES860XL will taste much better, and be a convenient part of my morning espresso."
5.0,Healthy alternative & profitable,I own a convenience store and sell a full line of Robert's products purchased from Amazon.  My customers and I have the same opinion.  It's like Cheeze Doodles without the greasiness.  But on the other hand I had one tell me that they like greasy snacks.  But if you are looking for healthiness it's Robert's.  At 33% profit it's much better than letteing a jobber come in to fill the shelves at 25% and none that I know of carry the Robert's products.
5.0,"So good, people pay 3x as much for it...","Tasty stuff.  I bought it locally to try out and saved a couple pennies over buying a 6-pack.  But I noticed on the local auction site, people are paying $5 for a SINGLE CONTAINER, plus $3 shipping.  Must be addictive. ;-)  Note to remember:  Always check Amazon first."
1.0,The most repulsive thing I've ever eaten,"When you buy an item like this, you know the chances of it being great or even good are fairly slim, but you expect that it will be edible. In the case of Thai Kitchen's Pad Thai bowl, that's a hideoussly misguided expectation. The ""vegetables"" included are dried shavings, not even as substantive as the tiny carrot chunks you get in a Cup O' Soup; and the sauce? It's like some terrible sweet and sour sauce you'd get from McDonald's--terminally sweet, with no hint of anything I've ever tasted at even a budget-on-the-run Thai restaurant. I've never had anything so repulsive--and I once mistook chocolate syrup for gravy and served it on turkey."
5.0,A cup to relax with,If you have to give up coffee like I did this is a product worth trying. You'll like it I guarantee it
5.0,Fresh and wonderful,"In a nutshell, these Medjool dates from the Bergin Nut Company,are very fresh, soft and tasty. There have not been and hard or dry ones. I will definitely order them again. The service was timely and they were packaged well. No problems whatsoever. Rosey"
1.0,Had a reaction to it--have never had one to any other product before...,"I'm not normally a sensitive type but when I used Degree Arctic edge I felt like the itchy edge--it irritated my underarms, became itchy and and I had a mild rash that took a couple of days to clear up. While it has a nice aroma if I can't wear it because of a reaction, it doesn't do me any good.  I would recommend trying a sample first on an area of exposed skin to see if you might have a reaction to this product before buying it or, if you already have purchased it but haven't put it on yet, use it on a less sensitive area to test it prior to applying it.  I was surprised by the number of reviews echoing my experience so be cautious. If you don't have a reaction more power to you but it's better to be forearmed and forewarned when it comes to your underarms."
1.0,Terrible customer service and shipping!,"The gumballs are fine.  Not a lot you can do to a gumball.  However, the customer service and shipping process for the Candy Depot is totally inept.  First, I received an email that my orders had been cancelled.  No explanation, just cancelled.  When I emailed to inquire what was going on, I got an email back saying that the items were being shipped by a quicker service, so I could receive the gumballs in time for Christmas (to go with the gumball machine that I purchased as a gift).  Great!  Then, two days later, I get an email from Amazon stating that my gumballs had shipped on that day, the 22nd, and not on the 18th, the date the Candy Depot stated they had shipped the item.  So, on Christmas day, there will be a gumball machine, but no gumballs.  Of course, if the Candy Depot had been honest, or at least not totally incompetitent, I could have gone out locally and gotten some.  But, alas, too late.  By the way, when I got the Amazon shipment notification, I again emailed The Candy Depot to ask what was going on, forwarding to them their email stating they had shipped on the 18th and asking what was going on.  Surprise, no response.  I suggest you get your gumballs locally or from someone other than the Candy Depot, unless you don't care when you get them (a week or so)."
1.0,snapper soup,the Bookdinders (old original) snapper soup was just aweful...threw all remaining cans in trash. No one in the family liked it. Waste of money
5.0,Cento tuna is delicious!,"I'd rather eat this canned tuna than any fresh fish that wasn't just pulled out of the water!  It's addictive...  And it makes regular grocery store brands of tuna taste like cat food.  Dry cat food.  This is well worth the price.  Try it tossed, oil and all, with hot pasta, a little lemon and some pepper for a super-quick and tasty meal."
1.0,there are better pods that cost much less,I bought these and the private reserve diamond expecting superior coffee because of the price. That wasn't the case. I believe there are better pods at much much lower cost. Other pod makers have kona blends that seem to have more flavor. Obviously it is very subjective to rate a coffee but I would not buy Aloha Island pods again. I have bought other pods from other companies and have enjoyed them much more.
5.0,Hummus baby! Hummus!,"When I first opened the product, i noticed that it separated. It took a bit of mixing to get it back to the right consistency which is still more on the liquid side than other tahini. Not a problem; the extra oil is perfect for hummus.  Three cups of chick peas, assorted spices and oils, and two tablespoons of this stuff...bam! Hummus baby!  So how much hummus do I get with this glorious two-pack? By my calculation using my famous 2 tablespoon recipe above, I should get to enjoy over twenty scrumptious batches of hummus (26 to be exact).  Should I bother or can I just go to the store and buy some hummus? Seriously? I can't believe you even asked me that. Lets break this down two ways 1)cost and 2)goodness:  1) Cost - So remember that recipe above? 3 cups is a ton of hummus. Basically, your closer to the largest container you could buy (17oz-20oz). How much did it set me back? About $1.70! Compare that to $5+ bucks you'll pay if your lazy self buys it in the store. 2) Goodness - I made a jalapeno version because some like it hot. I was amazing. Don't believe me? Just try to find a morsel of it left! You wont; so buy this and make your own."
1.0,Dropped from a plane?,"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box."
1.0,Kinda Tasty,"And by tasty I mean, they taste like sawdust with a layer of chocolate. These are horrid. I'd rather head to my local beach and stick a fistfull of sand into my mouth then ever eat these things again.  The first few chews aren't that bad. But as soon as the chocolate wears out it's really like you're eating sawdust. The after taste is horrid, the texture is terrible. Who ever thinks these taste better then rice crispy treats really need to go back and eat some much better rice crispy treats because they don't."
5.0,Bob's Creamy Rice Cereal vs. Erewhon Rice Cream Cereal,"This cereal is perfectly fine, although I prefer the Erewhon Brown Rice Cream Hot Cereal (organic).  I purchased it because the Erewhon cereal was not in stock, but now I will go back to my preferred rice cream cereal.  It is likely a matter of personal preference, although I enjoy the taste and texture of the Erewhon cereal versus Bob's Red Mill Rice Hot Cereal.  I would not discourage anyone from trying Bob's brand since it is likely a matter of personal preference."
1.0,NOT lower carb than Kraft or General Mills - why bother? Better alternatives out there for low carbers,"My local Italian restaurant knows I'm low carb, so the chef was excited to tell me they found a great low carb pasta. I was quite excited too - he had purchased this brand, it was very good.  BUT ... I went online to order it for myself, and actually read the nutritional count. It's NOT low carb. In fact, it's HIGHER carbs than many mainstream whole grain pastas!  I checked the supermarket shelf - you don't even have to go to the health food isle to find lower carbs than this. The General Mills, Kraft, Barilla, even Trader Joe's whole grain pastas (starting at $0.99 cents per box) have on average 17.5 carbs (less 1.5 fiber = 16 net carbs).  To be fair, the ""CarbNada"" brand has a generous portion size - 1.5 cups. I would probably not eat more than 1 cup at a time, so my serving size would be 12 net carbs. But still, the Atkins brand has half the carbs compared to this! (usually 4-8 net carbs per serving).  My suggested alternatives:  * Atkins has a few pastas that start at 4 net carbs. I will not eat a packaged pasta that's higher than 5 or 6 net carbs.  * Use julienned zucchini or squash instead of pasta - use it raw (soaked in olive oil for a few minutes), cook it (like mac & cheese), or lightly steam it in the microwave or in a steamer. It's much much healthier than packaged/processed pasta anyway, and almost zero net carbs. (You might want to skin it first)  * The best veggie to use for pasta is cucazza. You must always skin cucazza, then run it through a mandolin slicer on the julienne setting. Seriously, this takes 20 seconds.  * And, the BEST low carb pasta I've ever had is made from kelp - dehydrated kelp noodles. This one is not found in most stores, but you can find it online. Kelp is one of the best foods you should be eating, low carb or not. High in protein, high in minerals/vitamins/nutrients, and very low carbs (about 1 net carb), and nearly zero glycemic index. Plus, the noodles don't have to be boiled - just put in warm water for about 60 seconds. And they work with everything.  * Keep looking for other brands. They're out there. The best low carb breads and pastas are made from flax seeds. If you like the refined flour, light & fluffy breads & pastas, the best brands use a combination of soy isolate + almond flour &/or flax.  Bottom line: I believe this company's product labeling is opportunistic & slightly disingenuous. There are much better alternatives."
5.0,It grew on me!,"The first time I drank this tea, I hated it.  I left it in my tea cabinet and never touched it again.  I drink about 10 cups of green tea a day, and recently, I went to a salon where they were serving free green tea.  I had to take some.  The tea was incredible, and it turns out that it was the exact same tea that I had shunned the first time I tried it.  Yes, it has a distinct aftertaste.  It doesn't taste like green tea, in my opinion.  After you swallow it, an incredible taste bursts out and coats your entire throat.  It's truly delicious.  I don't know what herb is contributing to the aftertaste, but I can tell you that I've been drinking this all day and I wish there was an identical loose leaf version.  With other teas, I start to feel sick if I drink too much.  This is the only flavor of Yogi tea I've ever tried, and I'm thrilled that I can drink cup after cup without feeling sick.  Highly recommended.  If you don't like it the first time around, give it another shot.  Don't brew the tea at too hot of a temperature -- if the water is boiling, it's too hot.  I brew it at drinking temperature and I dip the bag a few times in the water.  Mmmmmm."
5.0,Life's too short to not have Haribo Gold Gummi Bears,This is the second 5 lb bag that I've purchased and it lasts about 3 weeks in a house with 2 teenagers. The gummi bears taste just like the ones that you spend twice as much for in the grocery store.
5.0,Love these candies!,"I love ""Jolly Rancher"" candies! Bought this pack because it would last me quite awhile and it was a great price. Great service and product! Thanks!"
5.0,LOVE THIS!!!,I have tried many brands and flavors of the K-Cups and this by far beats them all in my opinion. This is the only one I order on a regular basis. Try IT!! You will not be disappointed.
1.0,had to throw away fishy,"Don't buy this product it taists fishy, I had to throw away. Item came on time but would not purchase. Would not recommend."
1.0,Too thick!,"Will not be buying this flavor again.  My 10 month old will not eat it.  It is very thick, especially after being kept in the fridge after opeing."
5.0,cereal,the deal on this cereal is the best price i have found so far. love the cereal and appreciate the auto shipment. comes right to my door and i don't need to worry that i will run out of the product since i eat it every day.
1.0,Cafe americano,"If you like weak coffee this is it, but if you like a real expresso don't even bother with this one.After adjusting it for the 10th time i got a cup that was ok."
1.0,Whole wheat?,"The whole wheat spaghetti I got looked nothing like the picture: mine was pale and smooth, whereas the picture looks like it has a rough surface. Still, I tried it with an open mind because i knew it had two 5 star reviews. It didn't taste at all like whole wheat (i've been eating different brands for the last four years). It tasted awful actually--there was no grittiness and no ""fiber"" taste/texture. I think they made a mistake and shipped me the wrong kind of spaghetti--i'd be shocked if it was whole wheat because i side-by-side taste-tested two other whole wheat brands and this one, and this one tasted and looked completely different. Not ordering from them again."
5.0,Numi Jasmine Green....just what it says!,"Actual jasmine blossoms are laid on the green tea...simple, effective. Numi makes great teas, highest quality. I can actually steep this for quite a while without getting a bitter cup. Cheap green tea tastes puckery after steeping too long. Not so with Numi. Tastes great with a very light clover honey, but go real easy on any sugar so you can taste the jasmine! Make sure to inhale deeply as you sip...be in a quiet place too. Jasmine and green tea - NUMI does it again."
1.0,Taste like a flower,I love Hint water but this flavor taste more like a hibiscus than it does honeydew. I do not like the taste of flowers so i do not like this one.
5.0,Very good!,"I am very happy with this organic tomato sauce. I've tried diffent ones in the past, but this one taste really good. I Will be buying this case often."
1.0,Please read all negative comments before ordering,"My fault for not reading through all the negative comments. This is not coffee. It is pure chicory that Is not meant to be brewed alone. At the rate of 3 parts coffee to 1 part this I should not get thru One bag before the expiration date of dec, 2011!  Terrible taste alone or mixed. Had to boil my k-cup holder go get the bitter taste and odor away"
1.0,Stale Beans,"I have been buying 8 O'clock whole bean 50% decaf from Amazon for several months now through their subscribe and save program. Certainly a great deal @ $0.38/oz + free shipping.  Sadly, the last two shipments have not been fresh beans, despite there being 9-10 months left on the ""sell by"" date. When I open the foil bags there is no fresh bean aroma - only stale and the coffee is very bland tasting despite my new burr grind and brew coffee maker. The drop in freshness seems to coincide with the change in the package a few months back."
1.0,NOT good food,"Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!  We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.  We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.  To sum it up: 1. Good quality ingredients 2. Less supplements than some other brands 3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok 4. Affordable 5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money. 6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy  P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well."
1.0,1.55 @ Walmart for 18.5 oz,"Seriously. 10.5 oz cans?? 1.86  a peice? .18 an ounce, man.  ripoff."
1.0,False advertising,"These nibs taste good, but they're not raw. False advertising means stealing from customers. Avoid this company and stick with Navitas Naturals."
1.0,Flowers,"She wasnt very impressed by them, even asked me how much i had pay for them. So i did tell her. Her answers was that i payed to much for them. The article is very to small probably to make an impression."
1.0,Doesn't work with Tassimo Professional,"I was looking forward to trying this, but it doesn't work with the Tassimo professional machine we have at work.  I am so bummed!  I hope Amazon will take it back."
5.0,"Good product,  better sevice","So I wanted to get a few of these for backpacking.  Small size,  light weight and if it breaks not much damage done.  Was a little perturbed that shipping costs were so high but sometimes you have to pay these things.  Received the product today, 5 days before it was supposed to be delivered,  thank you Amazon and Tabasco."
5.0,Dog loves Bunny Bits,My dog goes crazy for these bunny bits - I let two bits roll on the tile floor and he chases after them before eating them. He is critter driven so anytime I can make something fun - he is for it. I highly recommend this product. My local pet shop discontinued these treats - I was so happy when I found them here online at Amazon! Will be buying more when we run low. These are small enough in size to use it as a training treat.
5.0,Best Combination of Flavor and Value,"I've had a Tassimo machine (not the same one) for nearly four years now, and have tried most if not all of the discs available through Amazon.  While I haven't been thrilled with any of the other Maxwell House discs particularly (I like a strong cup of coffee, but there are a wide variety of preferences on this issue), I've been very, very pleased with the French Roast.  It gives a strong but smooth brew and you can't beat the price--at the time I'm writing this you can get 2 packs of 16 discs of the MH French Roast for under $14, compared to 2 packs of 12 discs for more than $20 for the Starbucks blends.  I still buy Starbucks, particularly the Africa Kitamu, and Seattle's Best, particularly Henry's Blend, because I like variety in my cup of Joe, but MH's French Roast is great choice, especially if you have multiple coffee drinkers in the house and need to keep plenty of discs on hand while still keeping within your food budget!"
5.0,Heavenly,I had to hide these in the garage to stop everyone from wolfing them down.  Yummy Yummy
5.0,Absolutely Delicious,"I love chocolate, I love white chocolate. I love tootsie rolls, and this is an extra special treat. The bank is a lovely novelty for the kitchen counter, and the refills go fast. Everyone loves this vanilla flavor. Yummy!"
1.0,Really upsetting!,"I was not going to write a review but after getting 5 e-mails requesting that I do I figured what the heck. I was very excited to find this product online and couldnt wait to get mine in the mail..... Until it came. When I opened the box I find that 3 of the cans were CUT open. Not accross the top but across the side so I know that I didnt do it when I opened the box. I love the drink but I am really upset at the fact that I only got to enjoy 9 cans instead of the 12 that I had ordered. I dont believe I will be ordering anymore. I will just wait till a local store gets them so that I know what I am getting. Peace, Love And Joy!"
1.0,Disgusting and NOT PITTED,"This says the olives are pitted...they are NOT PITTED.  And they have the most disgusting mixture of oil and spices and the olives are WAY overly salted. I love salt, but these were unedible.  I have sense drained all the juice off of them and I have refilled the keg with filtered water and  a little vinegar, in hope to leach some of the salt and yuk taste out of the olives. In the past,I have purchased Roland Kalamata's in the keg and really enjoyed them, but these are a big disapointment, expecially due to the cost. I this had been a little jar of olives, then I would have just thrown them away. But I really hate to waste the money, so I am trying to repair the damage done by Roland. I will let you know if my ""clean up"" of the olives helped. And the fact that they are not pitted will hinder my clean up."
1.0,Not as good as I hoped,"I normally like salt & pepper pistachios but these were not very good.  The pistachios themselves may have been old or stale, the flavor was not the strong ""nutty"" flavor of a fresh pistachio, plus they were a bit mushy.  To me that indicates old pistachios.  If you're buying in a brick and mortar store make sure to get a bag with a distant expiration date."
5.0,A great tasting snack that's good for you and contains no sulfur dioxide (E220),"Crunchy N Yummy banana, like their  Mango ,  Papaya  and  Pineapple   is certainly in keeping with the Crunchy N Yummy brand name - it is deliciously crunchy.  The banana snack pieces are attractive.  They look like naturally glazed rounded slices of the fruit.  I find Crunchy N Yummy banana to be the most visually appealing of their 'tropical fruit' snacks.  Banana is a rich source of magnesium which is used for muscle tone of the heart and assists in controlling blood pressure.  In general, magnesium is used to relax the muscles.  I call Crunchy N Yummy banana my 'relax snack' :))  At only 110 calories per 1 ounce serving, you get the great taste and nutrition of a full serving of banana in packs that I can have on the go! I also use Crunchy N Yummy bananas in my cold cereals, yogurt and ice cream toppings.  The kids love them too! ... that's a plus!  These banana snacks are 100% natural and certified USDA organic - just sun ripened and freeze dried banana with no additives.  Crunchy N Yummy snacks contain no sulfur dioxide (E220), a food preservative commonly used in dried fruit.  (Some individuals may be sensitive to sulfur dioxide especially in large amounts).  Check around ... the price varies on Amazon.  Hope my review was helpful ... Jeffrey A. (Jeff)"
1.0,Tried the liquid and the granules,"Neither version of this stuff works for squirrels and raccoons.  Maybe for deer, dogs and cats, but that's not our problem - it's the squirrels, mostly.  Will try for coyote urine granules instead. How do lousy products like Critter Ridder even make it into stores?  I guess for suckers like us who don't read reviews on Amazon first."
1.0,Tastes like plastic...,"While the plastic packaging seemed oh-so-convenient for me, when I opened the first bottle and took a sip- YUCK. Plastic is all I taste. Then I noticed that it was also from concentrate!? What!? Way to ruin your product Zico. Wish I'd read these reviews first."
1.0,AWFUL!!,This cider was absolutely terrible! I couldn't even give the remaining kcups away! The taste is extremely fake and not worth the money!
5.0,Great flour substitute!,"My son has several food allergies including wheat, corn and rice.  This is a perfect blend of flours that I can truly use as an ""all purpose"" flour.  From baking, to breading this has been a tremendous time saver in the kitchen."
5.0,"Yummy, nutty, instant iced tea!","This iced tea is very yummy.  Slightly nutty, roasted flavor. I love coffee and this is a great instant tea for coffee drinkers.  I've also read that Barley tea is good for your skin, in addition to preventing tooth decay and helping with your heart health as well.  I can put the tea bag in a glass, fill it up with water, and continue refilling all day and still get delicious tea."
1.0,Buyer Beware,I purchased this product . It was shipped with polar pak to keep cool. The polar pak was ruptured and leaked gel all over the chocolate. Im sure the chocolate is good but not appetizing with gel all over. I went to return item and informed item is not returnable.
5.0,My kids loves these,"My almost one year old eats these all the time and my 3 year old still loves them.  I like to buy in bulk for the cost savings, and I bring a box for them for snack at daycare as well.  They also like the banana flavored ones.  They disolve in the mouth so I felt comfortable giving them when my girls could hold on to them around the time they started puffs."
5.0,Great Taste!,The stores around here do not carry this product.  My husband is diabetic and Swiss Miss No Sugar is perfect for us.  We use it with coffee to make our own cafe mochas.
5.0,Love this coffee!,"This is my husband's favorite coffee from Amazon, and I love it too!  It has a great price and fabulous rich flavor.  We are trying to get the whole family ""hooked"" on this great espresso.  We buy two bags at a time so we don't run out."
5.0,Japanese-style cooking must-have,"Miso is a base for many Japanese-style soups and other food treatments, no western substitutions are possible. This is my first experience with miso and a positive one. It is salty and assertive, but it IS a fermented concentrate after all. Buying the 2lb. size is the only practical way to stock this item at home, IF one is serious about learning its uses. It stores beautifully in the fridge after opening. The flavors are a welcome change from the usual euro-inspired fare and is far superior to the ""plastic"" asian food to which we westerners are subjected. Storage is no problem. Clip one corner of the package and squeeze the miso out like toothpaste to measure. Then, squish the paste back to the package bottom, squeeze air out, roll/fold the clipped end under and fasten with a clothes clip, big paper clip, etc. Stores for many months in the refrigerator."
1.0,Difficult to Swallow,"I have loved all the Labrada products I have purchased before this one. The shake tastes okay and mixes well in water. But digesting this product is a chore. Dehydration set in quickly after drinking and I had to drink an enormous amount of water, well beyond my typical daily gallon."
1.0,sorry  couldn't eat it,tasted weird gave it away my friend liked it she thought it was good so it didn't go to waste....i like the pancake syrup but I couldn't get with the Mayo
1.0,Not Original,The picture makes you think it's the original chocolate Twizzlers but they are actually the new disgusting recipe with the real Hershey's chocolate.  Don't be fooled by the picture!!!
5.0,good gluten free product for my daughter,"My 7 year old has to maintain a gluten free diet due to celiac disease. Before we discovered she had Celiac, she frequently ate boxed mac and cheese products.  She has really missed this type of product since going gluten free.  We tried several gluten free mac and cheese products and she hasn't really liked most of them.  we gave this one a try and really likes it.  The pasta is a potato pasta, which seems much better than the corn pastas we have tried.  She has had this several times and enjoys it.  Simple to make - just cook the pasta and add milk and butter, similar to 'standard' boxed mac and cheese.  Will continue to buy these for her."
1.0,Just by Chance,The only way these sticky pads work is if a flea accidently jumps into the trap. I guess you could wrap them around your ankles and see if the fleas jump on them as you walk around. Im going to just put some soapy water in the bottom of the trap and it should work BETTER than the sticky pads. But the trap doesnt attract fleas anyways. Shame on you Victor company.
1.0,Great Idea but too flimsy,I bought this product to keep my boxer entertained. She is very food motivated and very smart. The problem is that she tries to get the food out by any means necessary. This results in her being very ruff on the toy. I had to take it away for fear that she would break it.
1.0,THIS IS NOT A COFFEE BEAN/TEA LEAF PRODUCT,THE NAME OF THE COMPANY IS INTENTIONALLY MISLEADING.  THIS IS NOT A COFFEE BEAN/TEA LEAF PRODUCT.  I HAVE NOT YET OPENED THE PRODUCT.
1.0,Rip off,I spent $26.00 dollares for a tiny box of cookies and some 2 pc samples.  This is the biggest rip off.
5.0,Love them!,"I have tried a couple of compostable bags, and these are by far my favorites.  They are flexible and make picking up very easy.  They also take up less space in your pockets.  My only warning is that every once in a while I get one that is open at both ends, so I always try to make sure I have more than one on me, just in case."
1.0,misplaced trust,"It is such a shame that my 4 dogs loved the Taste of the Wild dog food and it was recalled due to the salmonella infected product!I enjoyed believing that Amazon wouldnt not sell anything I could feed them that would potentially hurt or even kill them!  It wasnt their fault and they did reimburse 2 of the 3 bags i most recently bought, but I have another full, unopened bag that I dont want any living creature to eat, but just cant throw it out!  does anybody think theyd pay me the cost of it plus shipping to send it back to them!?  janellelaine"
1.0,Artificial Ingredients and horrible after taste- not a winning combination,"I really enjoy naturally flavored spring water so I was excited to review this ""water enhancer"" for Amazon Vine.  The first thing that discouraged me was the list of really unhealthy ingredients. I wish the ingredients would have been listed in the product description.  I would have skipped this offer if I would have known it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose and Polysorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 is used in cosmetics and shampoos so I'm wasn't too crazy about the idea of consuming it. However, since I had agreed to review the product I went ahead and squirted one shot into an 8 oz cup of water.  It tasted like a cup of watered down kool-aid.  The taste wasn't horrible, but the after taste was unpleasant.  I added a second squirt and ended up with a cup of water that tasted like a mouthful of sugar followed by a bad after taste.  My kids also tried it and hated it.  Their exact words? ""That's disgusting""  I think we will stick to naturally flavored sparkling water."
5.0,great drink,"The spicy is spicy. The really spicy, could kill someone unsuspecting of it. It is a ginger/wasabi/horseradish type of hot. I enjoy it simply as it is, over ice, or as a mixer for a good bourbon."
1.0,Cheap and not worth the price,Everything in this basket was cheap and not worth the price.  There was even a sticker from oriental trading company on one of the items in the basket. Do not waste your money.  I buy lots of things from Amazon and have always been happy.  I have never written a review before - - but this one was sooooooo bad!
5.0,Get Stok'd,"Received my order in a timely fashion.  Did not get shorted, actually received 12 extra shots 276 in total.  Comes to about .11 cents a piece.  Way better than $3.00 for an energy drink...Thank You Amazon!"
5.0,Get Naked Doggie Dental Sticks....,These Dental Sticks are perfect for my two dogs that have food allergies and they LOVE them and i like the price for them here at Amazon.
1.0,unhappy with Very Asia,"I am glad you ask for a review of this product.  The Cafe DuMonde is excellent but the company that ships it for you leaves a lot to be desired.  Of the 6 cans we received, 3 of them were badly dented in and it did not happen in shipping because the box was in excellent condition.  This leads me to beleive that they were dinged that badly when they were packed.  If I had ordered them all for gifts, they would not have been suitable.  I then called the company to let them know I was unhappy with the condition of the cans received and I left messages at least 3 times with my name & phone number and none of those calls were returned.  I will not ever order this product again through Amazon and I think you should check into this since it is a reflection on Amazon as well."
1.0,Tastes more like medicine that pomegranate,"I was excited to see an all-natural soda at my drugstore made with cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup, but one taste of this was all it took to decide never to buy this again. I like pomegranate juice and expected to like this soda, but it did tasted more like medicine than soda.  All the cans in the store were dented and some were leaky. The aluminum is very thin and all the sodas got partially crushed and damaged during shipment. This is something to consider when ordering."
5.0,Delicious for instant ramen,"No instant ramen is ever going to live up to the real, fresh-cooked thing.  This is pretty dang close, though, and very spicy to boot.  I particularly enjoy it on cold days (or when I'm suffering from a cold)."
5.0,tomato soup,"This is real tomato soup.  I have never tasted tomato soup like this before.  If you like tomato soup that tastes like red ripe tomatoes, this is for you. You can use this tomato soup instead of tomato sauce."
5.0,"cooking, haircare, skincare and more!","Our family avoids chemicals as much as possible, so we use coconut oil for cooking, haircare, skincare and more!  We use coconut oil as a moisturizer in place of skin lotion (add a couple drops of a good quality essential oil!) We use coconut oil to saute or steam saute foods; I use a spoonful of coconut oil in our stainless steel cookware so foods NEVER stick! We also use it in our microwave popcorn popper with sea salt for the healthiest, tastiest popcorn around!  Coconut is a solid at cooler temperatures, it will turn to liquid when warmed ""slightly"" to the mid 70s.  Hence I store this bottle above our stove / microwave so it's usually a liquid. To make it MUCH easier to use, I have a wide mouth glass jar that I keep refilled.  When the jar turns solid I can still scoop the oil paste out with a spoon."
1.0,"alot of can, little lemonade",Small very well built cans filled with suggary not very lemonade or raspberry tasting clumpy powder. Didn't go very far. Dissapointed overall with price vs quality in McStevenson Sipperville Product
1.0,Complete waste!,Too pricy for what you get. I was expecting something delicious but unfortunately it's just a plain tortilla taste with a different look. You could get the same thing with any other brand name without having to pay a lot for it.
5.0,I love it!,"I am so glad I tasted the drink before reading the reviews here. If you think about it, it's not a juice. It is what it says it is, water.  It just happens to be coconut water. It tastes exactly how I would expect coconut water to taste. I love it! Plus all the health benefits from ingesting the potassium."
5.0,First time user,"Nothing like this is available where I live. This is a very nice product, and I will buy it again."
5.0,Smoked Pheasant,I thought the pheasant was very tasteful and would recommend to any one  who has never tasted pheasant to give it a try. Kinda tastes like ham.
5.0,Try it...you'll like it!,"Ok, who in their right mind would pay this much money for cocktail cherries?  Me! Seriously, these are most flavorful maraschino cherries...unlike any of the mass produced ones with artificial favors and textures. They taste like real cherries and have the same texture. Even the sweetened syrup is a great cocktail addition. Can you say that about mass produced types? Yes, they cost a lot of money, but they are worth it."
5.0,Awesome for Blowing Bubbles,"There are so many different kinds of bubble gum on the market today that I would be clueless as to how to list them all.  On the other hand, with a bubble gum such as Dubble Bubble, who cares?  Dubble Bubble has a long and glorious history.  The gum traces its history back to a bubble gum called Blibber-Blubber developed by Frank Fleer in 1906.  That gum was never marketed.  Other people at Fleer's company continued to work on the bubble gum, with the formula finished by 1928.  Perhaps the biggest change from the original Dubble Bubble to today's Dubble Bubble are the variations in flavor.  Double Bubble retains the original flavor along with a variety of other flavors, though the flavors are relatively mild.  Dubble Bubble has two features that make it one of the superior bubble gums.  First, the gum gets softer as you chew it (more on that in a moment).  Second, the gum makes excellent bubbles.  I like the fact that the gum gets softer as you chew it, though it can be quite hard initially.  There are other brands that begin soft, but seem to get chewier and stiffer the longer you chew it.  I suppose the goal with those brands is to chew the flavor out and then toss the gum.  However, with Dubble Bubble you can chew the gum for a long time and the gum remains soft.  I have made bubbles with Double Bubble gum a long time after I started chewing the gum.  Thus, the gum maintains its softness as well as its cohesiveness for making bubbles.  For even larger bubbles you can add a second gumball once the first one has been chewed for a while.  However, I recommend you abstain from a third gumball; the size of the gum becomes cumbersome at that point.  In spite of the huge array of bubble gums on the market today, I continue to choose Dubble Bubble Gumballs as one of my favorites.  I suspect that I always will.  Enjoy!"
5.0,Very good.,"These sunflower seeds are very crunchy and have just the right amount of salt. I love to sprinkle them on salads. Mmmmm yummy. My order arrived with six months to go before the expiration date and I found that even after they had ""expired"" by about a month or two they were still very good. I like buying the seeds in the 8.5 ounce packages because they stay fresh longer than when I open one large bag.

1.0,OLD ACAI,"The Acai that I orderd smells, and is Expiered. It is Brown instead of being Purple and it taste just horrible. I Use this on a regular basis and it is NOTHING compared to what I take. I would like a Refund of my money on this OLD, EXPIERED Item"
5.0,Great spicy pickle,What can i say these are good pickles and ok spicy. But good in Bloody Mary's and on hamburgers and hot dogs. Would buy more. If you are looking for serious heat these are not that spicy.
5.0,light taste,"I use it mainly to bake, in waffles & for popcorn.  Give a *great* light flavor to anything I've tried so far.  Excess is wonderful for dry skin/hands."
1.0,Don't Buy From This Seller!!,"Ice Breakers Frost are great little mints.  They are strong, but I have had them before and this is what I expected.  My issue is with this seller.  The product is misrepresented as a package of 12.  They only sent 6, and are refusing to provide me with the product as stated.  I have filed a claim with Amazon.  Buy the mints if you like strong peppermint, but get them from somebody else!"
1.0,Deceptive Advertising,"The labeling on this product is deceptive, I recently purchased this item in the store thinking when it says Pennsylvania Dutch and Americas Favorite Mushroom I was buying food produced in the US only to get it home and find it was a product of China.  How sad that a company would try to do this."
1.0,Not a fan,The flavor was OK but I didn't like the way the cups leaked after taking them out of Keurig. I have never had this problem with other Keurig cups. Dripping on the counter and on the floor.
1.0,Bone chucks are a blockage hazard.,"This was an X-mas gift for my dog and he loved it.  Then a couple days later he stopped eating, threw up bile everywhere, and became very lethargic.  I took him to the vet and there in his intestine was a nice chunk of the bone.  The medical bills cost two and a half times the dog but he recovered after quite a bit of worrying on my part.  This product is purchased for the express purpose of a dog chewing on it, but unlike rawhide it is not digestible and can cause serious problems including the need for surgery. I'm sure this is very rare, but do you really want to risk it? Babies tend to chew on things, would you give a baby something that you knew might cause it to choke?  If you buy this product, at the very least, watch your dog like a hawk or you could be dealing with a very sick and expensive pet."
5.0,Peanut Butter Satisfaction,"I love the taste of peanut butter but I just don't want the added calories or points.  This product is great if you like the peanut butter flavor it is a must try for a low cost.  I use it when making a low point strawberry & peanut butter smoothie.  It is the best, great taste, only 1 points-plus for 2 TBSP, and guilt free!  My taste buds are dancing with pleasure.  For my smoothie I use 1 cup of frozen strawberries (in place of ice), 2 Tbsp of PB2 powder, and 1 cup low fat milk just blend for 1 minute and enjoy. Buy this product another way to use it like a spread on wheat crackers (just add water slowly making the consistency you like & stir). Also I have added it to a plain 6oz yogurt & 1 TBSP of PB2 and dipped a banana - if you're following a healthy eating plan you have got to try this as a new snack or even a breakfast.  I think my next experiment will be with adding it to sugar free frozen yogurt or sugar free vanilla ice cream.  Yummy  : )  Thanks for reading my comment."
5.0,Healthy and tastes good.,"We love this cereal, it is nice and crunchy and it doesn't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes.  I definately will buy this again."
1.0,awful,This bubble gum does not remotely taste like it should and it will not even blow a bubble.  May be too old.  I am disgusted.
5.0,Love these bars!,"Fabulous taste--something a little different than the typical bars.  After purchasing one for a snack in Chicago, it's on my list to buy in bulk just to have on hand."
1.0,Too sweet,It's silly to call this a Cappuccino. There is no coffee flavor whatsoever. I have even tried making this 1/2 and 1/2 with strong coffee. Still can't tolerate it.
5.0,"Aromatic, Organic, Delicious","For $24.84, you get three 1.35 ounce box of Whole Leaf Earl Grey black tea (45 individual pouches). If you like the aromatic essence of bergamot, which is easily detectible in this morning, afternoon, or evening blend, then order this savoring tea in bulk. I like a cup of tea throughout the day. I feel it is the perfect pick-me-up tea, besides Jasmine Green, when I am rundown.  Over the years, I have found Whole Leaf teas have better premium flavors than regular processed teas. And Organic Earl Grey, with a twist of bergamot fruit essence, makes the experience more worthwhile.  T.B. Grant 8.14.12"
5.0,Love the tube,I have been looking for tomato paste in a tube for a long time because lots of recipes require a tablespoon or two and the rest of a can gets thrown out. I gave a tube to my daughter-in-laws and they love it too.
1.0,Yuck!,General Mills scores a big fat -0- for this new flavor of Cheerios.  Stick with the original or Honey Nut.  We just threw away a whole new box of this awful tasting stuff.  Too much cinnamon (subtlety needed here) and leaves a horrible taste in your mouth.  Save your money.
1.0,sweet n' low - Icky,"This stuff tastes like sweet n' low, really nasty! It doesn't mix very well, leaves a bad taste in your mouth all day, I wont buy it again."
5.0,GREAT COFFEE CANDIES,"I tried the plain coffee candies from Bali's Best and they are excellent.  True, deep coffee flavor and very smooth, not too sugary sweet.  I ordered these assortment jars because I also wanted to try the espresso and latte center variations.  I am a coffee addict and these are terrific."
5.0,Fresh and very good,Showed up quick and was sealed very well so it stayed fresh and strong. Tone's has a very good name in the Restuarant Biz too. Great spice for the buck
5.0,Great coffee at a great price,"We go through so much coffee at our house, that we might as well become coffee shop! The bulk Newman's coffee is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. A winner for my family!"
5.0,awesome!,"Product was delivered very fast, in fact, I think I got it the next day."
1.0,Not at all the same product I'm used to- VISIBLE DIFFERENCE,"I'm not sure how much the HFCS had to do with the difference- or the difference in vinegar.. but one thing is for certain, it tastes different from what I remember growing up. And I can confirm the difference visually. The test of Lea & Perrins is to take a white plate and put enough of the sauce to just cover the surface of the plate. It used to be a dark color, now it's a light tan color. WHAT IS THIS? It no longer has the tangy bold flavor, and instead tastes like a watered down version of its former self. I find myself piling on twice as much to try to bring back the old flavor, but never quite getting it. What happened to you lea and perrins? I miss you!  I'm going to buy the direct UK stuff and see if it's good."
5.0,potato beetle deterrent,"Sprinkle on potato plants where beetles are feasting and the feast is over.  The beetles scatter and nolonger find the plant quite so attractive.  It has also been effective against other bugs on other plants, but not useful where you intend to eat the leaves."
5.0,INSANELY GOOD!!!!,The chocolate peanut butter is INSANELY good!  Considering the nutritional facts I wasn't expecting to much and just wanted a low cal treat but this stuff is awesome!!!!  I am not one of those people that expects things to taste the same as regular:)  But it is honestly great!!!  Plus each serving has 4 grams of protein!  You absolutely can't go wrong!!
1.0,"Awful food, just read the ingredients","Cats are obligate carnivores meaning they need meat to survive, this food is  nothing by grain and byproducts, very low quality and you may end up paying a lot more with your pets health once they get older and their organs begin to shut down after years of eating this garbage."
5.0,Outstanding Pomegranate Product !!!,"This Agro Labs pomegranate concentrate, is, in my opinion, the best anti-oxidant morning juice drink you can buy for the maintenance of your ongoing cardio vascular and cellular health. You can google the anti-oxidant properties of pomegranate for yourself. Then ask yourself, what is the best pomegranate product. It will be the Agro Labs concentrate.  This company is a quick and reliable shipper and the price is right for a multi-botle purchase."
1.0,These Were Nasty,These had an almost crumbly dry texture to them.  Very gross.  My hang up about low carb foods are textures and this one ended up being pricey dog food as that was the only one who would eat it.  I had it with garlic and olive oil on it so I cannot tell you if the pasta had a good taste or not.    I suggest dreamfields if it does not spike your sugar as it is dead on perfect.  I am thinking of giving carb-nada a try.  I really like a lot of Dixie's products (even their faux potatoes) but not this one!
5.0,"mmm, mmm, good","I sent this in a ""care package"" to my daughters overseas. They LOVED it! Nice being able to send a little bit of home to loved ones far away."
1.0,If you like the flavor of plastic...,Just finished drinking some of this and the flavor of the thick industrial plastic bag is still in my mouth.  Very strong taste of chemicals and quite possibly the worst tea I have ever drunk.  I drink the Stash English Breakfast tea bags on a daily basis and enjoy those quite a lot so I had very high hopes for this product and was thoroughly disappointed.
5.0,"Lyons Pyramid Tea, Gold Blend - POSITIVE",This order was received well packaged and fast. This is excellent tea and will not hesitate to continue buying same.
1.0,Primary Ingredient is Soy,I've seen these at my local Petco where I looked over the ingredient list.  Soy or Soy protein is either the first or second ingredient.  Soy is something I avoid in anything I give my cat.  Soy isn't very digestible by cats and is often a common food allergen.  Also soy is also considered bad for your cat's thyroid gland.  In addition soy may also impact the amount of Taurine your cat absorbs; a lack of Taurine can cause blindness in cats.
1.0,Alert! No longer the Good Earth you remember,"I've been drinking and evangelizing Good Earth for probably close to 20 years, and have turned a lot of people on to it. A lot of ""natural"" brands emerged over the last 20-30 years, and most felt like they were sort of greenwashing exercises. Good Earth was a product and company that I actually loved and trusted. The original herbal Good Earth tea is sort of irreplaceable as a sweet, caffeine free natural beverage. Two hours ago, I would have given it a 5-star rating based on the box that's in my cupboard.  But I just got back from the store, where I discovered that in addition to changing the package (sad but no big deal), they've changed the recipe to include artificial flavorings. I'm absolutely flabbergasted that they have decided to throw away decades of customer trust this way. Artificial flavors in Good Earth tea! I want to die, just so I can roll over in my own grave.  Is the tea still tasty? I expect so, though when you throw chemical flavorings into the mix, my beverage options just got about a thousand times broader, and I don't think I'll ever find out. Are artificial flavors really that bad? Again, maybe not, and when I'm lazy I'm sure I consume a lot of them. But that makes the loss of a really great natural product that much harder to take.  If it were any other product or brand, I wouldn't give it a second thought. But as I said, Good Earth was special. Almost sacred, as I could do a little relaxation ritual during my day that centered around it. Now it feels like that tiny but precious sacred trust has been broken, and I feel curiously hurt by it.  It's hard not to feel like they've turned their back on the natural ethos that the original core customer base embraces, and corrupted the name Good Earth irreparably. They certainly have for me."
1.0,I've had better,"I bought a bunch of the Kitchens of India items during a promotional sale and the only one I'd recommend is the butter chicken sauce. If they were tasty I could overlook the salt content for the occasional enjoyment but I'm not loving the taste. I ofter buy similar products from Trader Joes and those, in my opinion, are much better and cost far less."
1.0,Don't Bother,I love the Medifast system and it has worked wonders for me.  I would not however purchase this product for essentially $33 when I can purchase it for half the cost directly from Medifast.
5.0,Great alternative!!,"A few years ago, going Gluten Free was really difficult. I missed the basic things I loved to eat and pancakes were certainly one of them. I tried other mixes but the batters were very dry and required items to moisten them such as fruit, etc. But Bisquick's GF pancake mix was surprisingly good! It is a great alternative to the real thing. Certainly all of us Gluten Sensitives out there know it will never be that delicious stack of buttermilk pancakes like we once knew, but I'm happy to know there's a great alternative. :)"
5.0,Great stuff!!,"I have read the praises of Manuka honey for a while, and decided to get it when I found it on Amazon.  The honey is wonderful in tea, and spread on toast, YUM!!"
1.0,Product now has artificial sweeteners....beware,For some reason the makers of Twist have recently replaced their naturally sweetened waters (using Agave) with Stevia Extract so the product now has 0 calories instead of 9. The Agave sweetened product was great and I was drinking a couple dozen of these a month. Now its just like all the other flavored 0 calorie waters using artificial sweeteners with the typical aftertaste. Very dissapointing.
1.0,Can be hazardous to your health,"This product should be removed from from your stock and not be sold....It contains MALTITOL which definately cause stomach distress cramps and serious diarrea .  It is used as a sweetener. A fine company like Russell Stover can certainly find a better sweetener. I'm sure this review will not be seen by anybody but please research MALTITOL.  I  now have half a dozen of these bags of sugarless jelly beans I have to throw away, because just a handful will send me rushing to the bathroom! Since Amazon is selling this product dispite my review, I will no longer purchase anything from Amazon.   Thank you.   Peter Panayoti"
1.0,Tastes like cardboard......,"These were actually cheaper in my local grocery store so i figured i'd give them a try.  I've had gluten free before, and quite a few are pretty tasty....but these tasted like I was eating the box, not the cereal.....very disappointed."
5.0,Great stuff!,This is the best peppermint tea.  So much more flavor than any other I've tried!
5.0,Good noodles,"My mother-in-law sent me an article about it. I always look for ways to eat healthy and this is definitely something one of the top things on my list. Easy to cook and use in the stirfry, soups, or any other noodle dishes. These noodles come in different types and there are plenty of recipes online for them. They have to be washed for a while to get the fishy smell out and i don't recommend it to eat them by themselves, they dont really have any taste/very plane. The good part about them is their nutrition value, compared to regular pasta/noodles, miracle noodles have Zero Carbs, Zero Calories, gluten and soy free. So, if you want to eat good and healthy without giving up food - this is for you. Oh and Amazon has the best price as well."
5.0,Excellent product....,We've been using Professional since our miniature Australian Shepherd was born & she is now 4 years old. She liked it immediately & it has not created any type of stomach or intestinal distress. It's a quality kibble & fresh chicken is shown as the first ingredient.
1.0,Horribly fake and waxy!,Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!  Alone they were nearly tasteless and I'll never purchase again.  Yuck!
1.0,Ick,"I'm not fussy about sugar-free foods because, after all, they're sugar-free. But these cookies are . I've had the sugar-free wafer cookies, they're okay. I've had some sugar-free chocolates from Hershey & Russell Stover, they're good. So I was expecting something that would satisfy a craving, at the least. These are dry and flavorless. I'd rather eat a saltine cracker."
1.0,Starbucks cinnamon coffee,"We're very disappointed. We love flavored coffee but when we tasted Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Cinnamon Flavored - it was terrible! It tasted like we were licking an ashtray. It has a burnt-grounds flavor. I highly recommend not wasting your money on this product."
1.0,Horrible!!,"Wasn't sure how exactly to apply this product since there are no directions, but being that it is for the scalp, I rub it into my scalp over my whole head.  The next morning I had to use Dawn dishwashing liquid to attempt to get it out.  Now my hair is even dryer and still greasy.  It went straight to the trash this morning."
5.0,The best tasting jerkey out there and healthy too!,I've searched for a jerky that actually has a tasteand is not just a tough salty piece of meat. This is by far the best tasting and healthiest out there. It's packed with protein and has a considerably lower amount of sodium.
5.0,123 Muffin Mix,"My son cannot have gluten and it is difficult to find good tasting gluten free products. I first purchased a box of the muffin mix at Krogers before ordering on Amazon. Oh my goodness! They are delicious! You can't tell they are gluten free. So now I order in bulk from Amazon because they don't last in my house for long. They are especially good when you add bananas, nuts, and chocolate chips. Thanks for a great product!"
1.0,Don't buy this!,"I purchased this synthetic cat litter from Target for several weeks, thinking that the odor control was very good and that it was more convenient to scoop less frequently.  For the first few weeks, I loved it and continued purchasing.  We keep the litter box in an small unused bathroom in our basement.  This fall, my inlaws came to visit and would be staying in the basement on an extra bed.  In preperation, I cleaned the bathroom and was horrified to discover a thick layer of blue dust all over the bathroom.  It clearly showed on the white paper towels!.  It was everywhere.  On the walls, ceiling, floor, behind the door, etc, and it was thick.  For a synthetic product, the amount of dust was unbelievable.  I cannot recommend this product.  I have returned to traditional litter, and am disgusted thinking about the amount of blue dust that has probably been circulating our house.  We've never had a dust problem with litter before and clean the bath room ever few weeks.  I could not believe the amount of dust on the ceiling! Simply unacceptable.  There is no excuse for a sythetic product that is supposed to be absorbant to spew blue particles into the air, our lungs, and the environment I live in.  Avoid."
5.0,Great Korma,"I have tried or will try all the Korma's available.  We also make it every now and then, but that can be large exercise.  This is great korma.  We are trying Seeds of Change Korma Sauce tonight."
5.0,Excellent snack,Tastes pretty good for being a pretty nutritional bar.  I'm going to buy another box when I finish them!
5.0,Great for training treats,"I am a professional dog trainer and I buy this product constantly.  It's a good price for a training treat. One 4 lb roll will last me just over a month when actively training large breed dogs. ( I would say would last one month, as training treats, for 2-3 large breed dogs, depending on their food drive).  I find this to be relatively gentle on their stomachs as well."
5.0,Excellent,This is an excellent bulk packed Yerba Mate'. The taste is very strong but not bitter. The packed Yerba has very little stems and is finely ground; highly recommended!
5.0,Great tea,I bought this tea for my 16 yr old son because he is a major hot tea drinker. I don't understand the bad reviews because we love it. All the variety is wonderful & he likes to put it on the largest setting which I do find a bit watery but on the next lowest setting its perfect. So far we just ordered our second box in 3 weeks. Celestial Seasonings is great. Thx.
5.0,my chocolate and crunch fix,I looked for these cookies after shopping in DC with my husband's 90 year young cousin. She loves them and said she could only get them in one store in the area she shopped. She doesn't go out anymore and someone else shops for her. I went online to see if I could find them and I did. I hope to see her soon and take them to her. Thank you.
5.0,coffee cups,These cups are excellent.  They are my favorite cups.  I recommend them to anyone who likes this sort of thing.
1.0,Hot Leaf Juice! I disliked this brand of Jasmine Tea,"I wanted to try Jasmine Tea, I ordered this one but didn't want to wait for it to come in so I bought Jasmine Tea at my local Whole Foods. That tea was wonderful so I was looking forward to making my own at home. After trying this tea I was disgusted, it was not as smooth as other Jasmine Tea I had tried before and after tasting this one. It has a wonderful scent, but I want tea, not potpourri. In short after made it isn't tea, but Hot Leaf Juice. I don't like the this tea, and will not buy any other Yamamotoyama teas. Jasmine Tea is wonderful, floral, and sweet. If you do want to drink Jasmine Tea try a different brand."
5.0,Great and chewy tasting cookies,"When we got the box, I wasn't particularly expecting much, but after the first taste, I was rather impressed.  Very chewy and soft, they are sweet but not overpowering and have a great chocolate flavor.  So I gave them to my wife and kids to try and before I knew it they were gone.  So, if you are looking for a nice treat that doesn't leave crumbs all over the floor, satisfies the craving for sweets, and is reseal-ably stored, I would definitely recommend these Chocofudge coockies."
5.0,"Great results always, pizza or Ciabatta","I originally bought this flour for pizza dough when I bought two heavy baking stones for my oven.  I was a total novice at the time, and the pizza dought came out superb.  This is indeed the flour that is required for a true Neopolitan pizza, according to the international standard promulgated in Naples.  When I found that I had a decent mastery of pizza dough, I decided to try my hand at baking ciabatta bread.  Once one acquires the discipline to actually follow the recipe, even though the hydration ratio seems impossibly high; and once one has the confidence to attempt what seems like folding water, one will be rewarded with a truly magnificent ciabatta.  The texture, the elasticity, and the airiness of the crumb are perfect, and the nutty flavor is addictive.  I can't recommend this flour highly enough."
5.0,Excellent snack!,I love these and usually have one a day! They give me the POTATOE flavor and crunch without the fat and calories!
1.0,Awful Coconut water,This product is full of sugar and non-returnable.  I got stuck with 30 cans of an unhealthy product!
5.0,Best mints on the market!,"I gave up looking for these in the stores, as Target seemed to be the only ones who USED to carry them.  Haven't seen them in the longest time, which is sad because these Ginger Altoids are the cat's meow!  They're very strong tasting, which is what makes them such a delectable treat.  If you've yet to try these, you're truly missing out on something a little bit more than wonderful"
5.0,Good Deal,"With the price of Halloween candy sky rocketing like everything else, I found this to be a good deal. The candy was fresh and delivery was prompt."
1.0,Did not send the brand advertised,"After ordering these for 3 years for my dog, they sent a different brand distributed by Radio Systems Corp, Made in China.  Granted, when I look at what's remaining of my last package of Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide Refil Ring (as advertised), it also was made in China.  It just annoys me that they have changed their distributor/manufacturer.......and haven't changed what they advertise they are selling. I will return these and find another company to order from.  Perhaps Premier Busy Buddy Gnawhide rings no longer exist and I'll have to find another favorite treat for my beloved dog.  Buyer Beware"
1.0,Delivered in very warm temperature FIji water.,"I live in Texas, so it might be the reason that the Fiji water was very warm when I recieved. However, I think the bottled water delivered without careful handling. The Fiji bottled water taste was not very good and the hot weather could damage the Fji bottled water."
5.0,THE ABSOLUTE BEST!,"I mean delicious!  When you first open the box, the aroma smells divine. Inhale. I couldn't bake a cookie as good from scratch, but anyway, you'll think they are from scratch, and so will anyone you feed them to.  I like to use unsalted butter, with the one egg the directions call for.  They bake up soft in the center and crispy around the edges. Don't overbake. Pull them out when they still look a little underdone in the center and the edges are just slightly golden brown.  They are done.  Just need to cool. If you overbake, they will get too hard when cooled....I don't mean crispy, I mean hard.  They have the perfect amount of those scrumptous Ghiradelli chocolate chips. Sometimes, I add toasted pecans and most times, I don't. They don't even need nuts, they're so good.  They are ""dangerous"", but I always have them on hand.  I make up a batch of the dough, put it onto parchment paper and roll it into one big log, wrap in foil, and freeze.  I slice and bake, as many..or few, as we want.  Amazon's price is great.  They are 3.99 a box in my area supermarkets.  When I first saw the box at the grocery store, I thought they were a little pricey, but  I've tried the Betty Crocker  mix, Duncan Hines, the way overpriced (and definitely not worth it) Barefoot Contessa, as well as most store brands.  No comparison.  With the exception of the Barefoot Contessa, this is the most expensive cookie mix on my supermarket shelves.  They are worth every penny."
5.0,"tasty, human grade ingredients, unique manufacturing process","Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- there's a chicken version and a fish version. I'm really careful to keep on top of the literature about pet foods, and so I'm confident that this food meets a high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, in addition to a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.  On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!  Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.  I came across this cat food at the local Tractor supply (I was there to buy chicken feed!). I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too."
5.0,Great cat food - great price,I've been looking for this cat food locally; it seems that everybody is either out or doesn't carry these flavors.  This was great!  Fast Service at a great price.  I will definitely buy here again!
5.0,"By Golly, it is actually TASTY!","I can't believe this Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers actually tastes good!  And furthermore, the directions are simple, written well, complete with pictures if you can't read instructions well.  In other words, if all fails, look at the pictures!  The packaging is compact, a bowl with the pasta, a lid that becomes the strainer, and another lid that contains the sauce.  It requires 3 and 1/2 minutes to cook the pasta.  And microwaving is safe; it doesn't make it coarse or soggy.  Let it set a minute and heat the sauce for 30 seconds.  Easy, a lunch/meal in less than 5 minutes.  This isn't meant to be enough for a dinner/meal, so you hearty eaters can open a can of vegetables and there you have a meal.  One note on cooking the pasta.  Make sure the water covers every piece of pasta, otherwise you may get a hard end on the ziti.  Take this for lunch on the go.  Eat it for a quick dinner and you have a tasty meal.  There are only 6 grams of fat, and 2g of saturated fat, and 230 calories.  Total carbs are 56g and 15g of protain.  Nonrefrigerated! The special thing here is that the meat sauce with enough meat, does not have to be refrigerated.  So, my only guess is that is is hydrated or dehydrated, whatever they call it, so it doesn't need refrigeration.  Quick and easy prep time, and tasty!.......Rizzo"
1.0,Its NOT coconut water,This is not coconut water. Perhaps it is coconut flavored water. It tastes like somebody soaked stale dried coconut flakes in water and then dehydrated the cloudy water they got from it into a powder. I doubt that it has the same minerals that are in coconut water.
1.0,It's not coffee!,"We really wanted a product that tasted like coffee and this is slightly similar.  But we were disappointed because it just doesn't have that coffee flavor.  We bought three bags and we have 2 and one-half left.  We just can't ""get it down.""  If you do buy it, make sure you follow the instructions otherwise it will come out too ""thick."""
1.0,no taste,Looking to end caffein in my life.  Tried several caffein free brands and this one was a big disappointment.  Both my wife & I will not finish the 40??
1.0,Bad batch,"I have been buying Zico's mango flavored coconut water for several months now but last 2 packs I received did not taste the same. It tasted as if it had gone bad/expired/etc. Normally this is a great product but after receiving two bad batches, I won't be buying Zico anymore."
5.0,cant...stop...eating...these,"A 3lb bag of Gummis?  Insane.  A 4pack????  12 POUNDS of GUMMIS???  Unbelievable.  These arrived fresh and tasty.  Amazon has them in their ""quick-ship"" boxes so these Gummis must be popular.  What else can be said?  Delicious.  Yummy.  Tasty...and popular.  I put out a dish of Gummis at work and it was emptied before lunch.  Average serving size is 17 pieces for 140 calories.  One note:  Bags are *NOT* resealable.  Once they are open, they are open.  Have some air-tight containers ready to store extra gummis.  Otherwise, they will harden!"
5.0,Tasty,"Buy it if you like cinnamon. I find the flavor strong and spicy. It makes for a strong tea, yet, without caffeine. Excellent if you are trying to kick a coffee habit."
5.0,We don't have to feel bad eating these brownies!!,"These are by far the best fat-free desert out there! I am a pleased to say we order these cases two at a time! My kids love to make them,and take them to school. No pudge rocks!!"
1.0,1 box of 5 cookies at an offensive price,"Buyers beware that this sale is for 1 box of 5 cookies NOT five, 5-Count Boxes as what seems to be advertised here. I thought I was buying ""in bulk"" - five, 5-piece boxes - at what is competitive, albeit slightly more expensive than several retailers that sell the same cookies; the few cents more was not an issue since free delivery is a plus. Surprisingly, I received one box of 5 cookies for the outrageous price of $18.85. Hopefully, the Amazon webmaster will correct the description so that the next buyer knows exactly what he/she is paying for - 1 box of cookies.  The Amazon rep was very helpful in rectifying situation which was the only saving grace here.  I'd be happy to buy again in the future and give 4 stars if this does indeed become a five, 5-count box offer."
5.0,Tea,All the teas I ordered have been great.  This is a little stronger so I tend to use less of it when making a pot or cup of tea.
1.0,why would you put EGGS in sweet potatoes???,"Just make plain Sweet potatoes. I can;t buy these because my dog is highly allergic to Chicken, eggs and everything dairy."
5.0,Perfect gift,The shipping was super fast and the product heaven. This honey makes the perfect gift. I'm going to stock up on them and give them in baskets for x-mas gifts.
5.0,My Boxer's favorite treat!,"My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!"
5.0,kids love it!,"I have been looking for these for a while. My kids love the convenience of these in their lunchbox, and I do too! They taste good with no extra yucky stuff. If you watch what you give your kids and don't like all the extras that are put into kids foods, you'll love this."
5.0,Dilmah Tea,"Our daughter gave us a Dilmah tea chest upon returning from Sri Lanka.  We were so pleased to be able to purchase Dilmah tea at Amazon.  Now that we have tried it, we like it better than any other tea.  Every other tea seems insipid."
1.0,Worst tasting hot chocolate ever!,"This dark hot chocolate is so bad, I would be ashamed to produce it and put my company's name on it. YUCK! I put it out where I work and the other employees think the same thing..... YUCK! Being from the SOUTH and home of some really GREAT hot chocolate.... this stuff I wouldn't serve to my worst enemy! HORRIBLE!!! It taste like an old shoe has been boiled, the shoe broth poured over cheap dark chocolate flavored wax, and then added a pound of netrasweet to the mix....... YUCK.... YUCK.... AND MORE YUCK!  If you want an instant hot chocolate, save yourself from this YUCK! Buy swissmiss and be happy! It's much better!"
5.0,Jayjayreviewer,"OMG!  My husband has Celiac Disease and we have both tried MANY gluten-free cookies.  Some are disgusting, some ho-hum, some great, these are FABULOUS.  I still can't believe how great they are.  I first purchased them for him as a birthday gift, thank goodness they turned out to be tasty.  You will not be disappointed with this WHOLE line of cookies.  Thank you to this company you have an excellent product!"
5.0,Best coffee ever!,I recently visited Paris and when I came back to the States I couldn't drink the coffee. So I found a French website that had some great brands but it cost and arm and a leg to send them here. LavAzza was one of the Italian coffees on the French website and I found it here on Amazon!! So now I can have excellent espresso for a decent price!!! Thank you Amazon!!!
1.0,chemically sensitive people beware,"I don't trust it.  Ate about a handful and feeling like it might give me a migrane.  Will call the company and complain, there is no need to put that weird stuff on perfectly fine blueberries!"
5.0,YUMMM...,I bought this for my friend who loves jelly bellys and it was amazing.  The box was perfect when it came and nothing was squished. my friend loved it but ate it within a week!!! i highly reccomend this for any jelly belly lover!!!!
5.0,Great treats,"Product is fairly priced, shipped on time and in good condition.  Cannot ask for more.  The treats provide a healthy source of enjoyment for our dogs....they really look forward to them."
5.0,Just what I was looking for,"I've been on a low-sodium diet for a number of years and I'm always on the lookout for low sodium products, so I was delighted to find this. The snack size bags are already portion-controlled and the perfect size for me (and they're only 3 ppv on weight watchers).  Several of the reviewers have complained that the popcorn is lacking in flavor (and if you're comparing this to full-sodium popcorn and have never used low-sodium products, that's definitely true). But for anyone who is watching their sodium intake, has already reduced the amount of sodium they consume, and wants just a hint of salt, this hits the spot.  With regards to burning in the microwave, my microwave has 3 popcorn settings: regular, medium, and mini bag, and this size works best on the mini setting."
5.0,The only tea for me.,I drink a lot of tea. And this is the only kind I have now. It's great hot or iced. It's also healthy for you and the flavor is better than other brands. I am never without it.
1.0,Bitter & Over-Roasted,"Beware any coffee that doesn't tell you what kind of coffee beans they use. There is no info on the bag and nothing on their website that I could find. I would be surprised if these were Arabica coffee beans, although they could just be really inferior Arabica, I suppose. I know lower quality stuff is being grown in Vietnam but that's generally the limit of my cursory knowledge of coffee beans. I know what I like and I hated this coffee. I drink my coffee with no cream or sweetener. To drink this stuff I would require cream, sugar, and a gun pointed at my head. My wife picked up a bag of this mud at the supermarket because we do like trying different brands but after one pot we threw out the rest of the bag. I realize that tastes vary widely but you might want to try buying only one bag instead of a 3-pack. Then you won't feel so wasteful as you're spitting this bilge into your sink."
5.0,EXCELLENT COFFEE SUBSTITUTE WITHOUT THE CAFFEINE,"This stuff tastes almost like coffee to me, but is made of so many wonderful healthy ingredients that I feel good about drinking a couple of cups of it every day.  Don't get me wrong, I still drink coffee, but instead of two, three, four cups of coffee a day, I'm now just drinking one."
1.0,"Bag is half pound, Not one pound.  Poor taste","The bag I received contained 8 oz. of tea, not the advertised 16 oz.  This is the reason it now sells for $24 when it used to sell for $48.  The manufacturer's label on the bag said it held one pound, but the bag was not physically large enough to accommodate that much tea.  Amazon gave me the option to accept half of my money back, which I went for.  I might also note that the glossy-finish bag appeared to have been well worn.  It looked like it had been reused many times.  Regarding the stems that another reviewer mentioned, over the years I have purchased Pearl Jasmine from three other suppliers (Numi, TeaSpring, SeattleTeaCup.com).  All of them looked like this.  With Davidson's product I actually noticed much shorter stems attached to the leaves than with other Jasmine teas, and the leaves were larger.  I also noticed that the pearls are slightly smaller than what I have purchased from other suppliers.  The aroma from the open bag was pleasant and similar to what I have experienced with other suppliers' products.  The taste is another matter.  I brewed a cup and found a bitter taste not observed with any of the other brands.  Tea from other suppliers has always offered a pleasant aroma and taste that makes Pearl Jasmine worth the extra cost.  These are sadly lacking in Davidson's product.  I do not recommend it."
1.0,Very Disappointed,"I ordered  Smoke paprika, unfortunately i received regular sweet. I called and spoke with a gentleman, who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. Until today (1 month maybe 2 later) still haven't received anything or heard from the company. Very disappointed."
1.0,wouldn't buy again,I purchased the Van Houtte Napoletano Dark Roast K-Cups for the first time and found these to be a big disappointment. They made a weak cup of coffee but also had a very unpleasant flavor.  I won't drink them and I'd be leery of buying this brand again.
5.0,Happy Cats,My cats love Friskies and with Subscribe and Save I can get a month's supply in at once cheaper than I can buy at my local store. I have had no problems (fingers crossed) with any damaged boxes or cans.
1.0,Not the coffee on,"Tasters Choice has several types of instant coffee.  I ordered the coffee in the picture-Gourmet.  I received house blend, not the same at all.  IT IS A lesseraa grade.  Amazon sent the wrong coffee."
5.0,"Low fat, high fiber -- and great taste!","This cereal has just about everything: great crunch, lots of interesting ""bits"" (cranberries, nuts, etc.), and it's wonderfully filling.  Two-thirds of a cup doesn't sound like a lot, but with this stuff and 1/2 C of skim milk, it's a decent serving.  If you're on Weight Watchers, this will fit right in: a serving with skim milk is only 4 points -- not bad for a nice filling breakfast.  Add some fresh fruit, and you're set to go.  Amazon's price is quite good, too.  This stuff is sky high in the supermarket if you can find it.  Yes, you have to buy 5 packages, but a little goes a long way -- I have it 2-3 times a week, and I'm not getting tired of it at all.  All in all, a good value: healthy, filling, and great taste."
5.0,Organic ginger,"Ginger is excellent for many things that ail you and this product is reasonably priced and suits my purpose.  Nothing thrilling to say, if you want to get some ginger and you can't trek to the supermarket to get fresh ginger then this is just what the doctor ordered.  Also it can be used to make multiple ginger beverages."
5.0,no more tums,"For years, I have missed out on a high quality, digestable, nourishing product.  Drinking whole milk has caused me indigestion, among other things, gas, and weight. My first glass of this milk acted like a probiotic. Milk I had as a child which I had gotten away from.  My food settled down where it supposed to go after my first glass of this milk.  I was so happy with this powdered milk that I would recommend it to anyone. Throw out the lactose milk and get good quality milk. True, it is expensive, but it is worth the cost.  The feeling of not being bloated, not drinking milk with additives and preservatives, knowing that it is nutritious, that the milk comes from the best dairy country, thrills me greatly. I have wasted too many years in getting the best product from Amazon.  This product has my highest recommendations."
5.0,Better than artificial sweeteners,"This is my second time getting this product, Madhava Organic Nectar (light). What can I say, bottom line it taste great! It's sweet but doesn't change the flavor of what you are mixing or leave an unpleasant aftertaste (key - does not leave aftertaste!).  I tried using honey and after eating honey every day I believe the honey started to disagree with my stomach. I switched to agave nectar, I use it for everything but primarily with coffee so I dink it every day and did not have any discomfort or side effects.  If you are still not sure look for it locally and try a small bottle, try to get this particular brand since I have not tried any of the others (there is no need). I mean, the agave nectar doesn't taste like sugar, the flavor is a bit more like honey but with a milder ""organic"" taste, but if you are already looking at this page and decide to get it I don't think you'll regret it.  ... Did I forget to mention the flip open top works great?"
1.0,They don't say this but these are hot and spicy when they arrive,"I had to throw them away, because when they arrived they were not plain. They were ""hot and spicy"" meaning they have green jalapeno peppers baked into them and red chili powder on top. I tried one bite and my mouth is still burning. I will try to get a refund."
5.0,Just the Best!,"I've just recently switched to GF cooking after my doc ran sensitivity tests (soy, milk, peanuts, the usual suspects). Gluten popped positive. Lucky me. Well, as one who still has recent (fond) memories of wheat pasta, believe me when I tell you that this tastes identical! Cook it, RINSE it, and smother with your favorite sauce. It can't be beat. I've tried a bunch of different GF pastas and this is the one I'm ordering in bulk.  As with other GF pastas, it should be rinsed after cooking.  Then it's perfect. As a side note, this blend (brown rice with flax) doesn't leave nearly as much starch in my pasta pot as the others do. Not sure why, it's just something I noticed."
5.0,Awesome,This is the best coffee cake I've ever had and in fact the entire family ate all of it on Xmas morning.  I wished I had ordered two.
1.0,"New ""improved"" flavor is AWFUL!!!","Spearmint Altoids were my favorite for years.  When local stores quit stocking them, I began ordering them on-line.  How disappointing it was to receive the new ""improved"" flavored Spearmint Altoids.  They're AWFUL!  I can't believe they would take their best product (in my opinion) and totally trash it.  Please bring back the original Spearmint Altoids.  PLEASE!!!"
5.0,great product.fine service.,"great product. recv'd fine service.i would definetly order this again.saltines arrived in fine shape and on time as noted.there was no breakage to speak of, remarkable for such a fragile item."
1.0,Damaged Goods,"Diamond Shelled Walnuts, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) I was greatly disappointed. The Bags were damaged - cuts in them - but there was no damage to the box they came in - so, of course, I got stale walnuts."
5.0,"Blue, no salt added -- amazing!!","I've been a subscriber to the Blue Chips with no salt added for about a year now and love them. These chips are great for nachos or with good salsa, and probably other things I haven't tried. Now that I've been eating them without salt for so long, eating salted chips is like an overload. You'll get used to it and appreciate the health benefits.  I only wish they were cheaper and came in bigger bags!  My mouth is watering now..."
5.0,Great Chew!!,"I have two large dogs (55lbs, and 85lbs), one picky and one will eat anything and they BOTH went crazy for these! When I first gave them these chews they were SO excited they didnt want to eat them! Eventually they got over it and really enjoyed these bones! Glad amazon has them!"
5.0,Amazing!,"So I orginally bought this oil for my hair and it works perfectly fine because its 100 percent pure olive oil, I accidentally left it on the kitchen table going off to work one day and my husband used it for a brownie mix cause we were out of vegetable oil that the recipe required and oh my gosh this olive oil made my brownies come out moist in the inside with a light crisp on top I rate this olive oil 5 stars all the way there is nothing bad I can say about this brand. Also has a light smell that's not overpowering. If you are looking for olive oil a lil on the pricey side its worth the money."
5.0,This was a celiacs dream. Delish!!!,"For us who are Gluten free, finding good dishes without having to go totally from scratch is a bit of a challenge.  I found these on sale and bought it to try. Wow was I impressed!! Not sure what smell the other reviewer was talking about, it smells great and is perfect in it's spicyness.  I will definately be making this again.  By the way, I added water chestnuts for crunch and it was a nice add in. I did'nt at shallots or mushrooms. I used a rotisserie chicken and carrots."
1.0,DO NOT BUY FROM THEM,"My cans arrived last week, and I was a little surprised that most of the cans were dented, but I figured, no big deal, just some rough shipping or something. But no, the cans are all dented from pressurization in the can, which I discovered when I opened one and found a giant bacteria colony inside! They're all like that... either poorly canned or poorly stored or past expiration, I dunno, but I do know I just got an entire pack of inedible cans... and Amazon won't let me return them!  Avoid this like the plague...which, incidentally, might be what's inside the cans."
5.0,Gluten free indulgence!,"Anyone who is 'gluten-intolerant', or has Celiac Disease (as I do) should try the Tinkyada brand Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)  Tinkyada Brown Rice Penne Pasta with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)  of pasta.  It is as good or better than any imported, gourmet pasta I used to buy, and cooks 'al dente' without the typical mealy breakdown you get with corn or other non-wheat pastas.  Tinkyada allows me to continue to enjoy my Italian heritage without sacrificing quality, texture or taste!"
5.0,Another Staple on the Shelf,"This is my third review of an Eden Organic product.  What can I say, we are pleased with it and will continue to keep it on hand.  A very satisfied customer, am I."
1.0,"It's not ""RED"" rice, it's ""BROWN"", misleading product label","Yes, I should have read the whole description, so I take part of the blame.  However, I can't see how in any way how this rice could be considered ""RED"" as stated in the title above:  ""A Gourmet Aromatic Whole Grain RED Rice""  Nowhere on the front of the bag does it clarify that it's brown rice as it does on the back.  I'm not saying it's bad rice, just that it's not RED as the title clearly states.  There is a specific type of rice known as ""red rice"".  This is NOT it.  When it arrived in the mail, the front label says ""RED RICE"" on the back it says it's brown rice.  So, yes, I should have read the whole description closer, but just calling brown rice red on the label doesn't make it so.  Disappointed, will not be buying any more Lundberg products.  Sorry, but you ticked me off with your misleading labeling."
5.0,Evangers dog food,"Great product! This dog food has a very healthy rating from professional canine associations..  My Jack Russell loves the taste,  the price is right and the shipper very reliable."
1.0,shipping took forever!,I figured i would buy this online since it was cheaper than in the stores and my fish had about 4 days left on their food. if i waited my fish would have probably died.lol. i had to go out anyway to buy fish food because the shipping was soo slow.
1.0,Delft Tins Arrive Damaged,"The Fortuin Wilhelmina Peppermint candies are wonderful.  However, I ordered these delft tins as something I could use for gifts.  The tins arrived so dented and scratched that I could not use them for their intended purpose.  While I love the peppermints, I would not order these decorative tins, because they were not wrapped well and suffered damaged in shipping. Fortuin Wilhelmina Peppermints in Delft Tin 17 oz "
1.0,Disappointment in a bottle,"I enjoy Monin Mango Syrup in my iced tea and wanted to try it sugar free.  This syrup was not the answer.  Upon opening, I am going to stick to the regular syrup from now on."
5.0,Only food my Shiz Tsu likes,"My Shiz Tsu is very picky about what he eats. I have bought many brands of dog food, and he would rather go hungry than eat any of them. Then I tried Cesars and he loves it. So needless to say it is the only kind I buy anymore. So far he likes all the flavors he has tried."
5.0,"Great for Old, Tired Ferrets!","Bought the senior diet for my 9 Year old ferret. She sleeps a lot lately, but was way more active after just a week! Very Pleased with noticeable results & her overall well-being. Great formula for really old ferrets!"
5.0,Great flavor,"I really like this tea.  I have been drinking bigelow Eggnoggin but find this tea to have more flavor, not as light as the eggnogg one.  I also get more of a kick from the caffeine in this tea.  All in all, I subscribed to it for every 6 months, what a great way to buy groceries this is, cheaper than in the store and THEY pay the shipping.  Highly recommend subscription."
1.0,Not For Me,It's very runny and leaves a bitter after taste. I like my snowcones sweet. I guess I'll be dumping this out and going back to the the last syrup I purchased. I thought the large gallon jug would be nice.
1.0,"Horrible Job, Kraft!","Update of 05/20/2012: The photo on Amazon features the ""New Taste"" Catalina product (carefully examine the label), yet the title line for the product includes the word ""Classic"" in the product available from the 'Ozbo' supplier.  Be very careful about what you buy.  Some time ago, Kraft finally relented and brought back the 'classic' Catalina after lots of negative commentary about its ""New Taste"" Catalina formula.  My Previous Entry: I purchased a bottle of 'new' Catalina dressing at our local supermarket to try it out.  What a disaster!  DO NOT purchase this 'new taste' product if you are expecting the traditional Catalina dressing."
5.0,The best sunflower seed yet and I am a seed eater...,These seeds are great. Great flavor. Nice big seed without purchasing the jumbo version. All of these are jumbo. Enjoy.
5.0,Classic,"I am not in love with the taste of Gatorade but I am not averse to it either,  But I mainly drink this for effect. This drink is associated with athletes, but for those of us who DON'T take care of ourselves, it has its uses.  Back when I drank--another story--if I had some of this before bed, I may have been tired the next day, but didn't feel like walking death--which I would have without hydrating with this.  Hats off to me: two years and not a drop of booze. Which brings up the coffee and cigarettes, which a lot of us obsessive ex-guzzlers use as far more benign vices. These also dehydrate you. I am weening of the ciggies and cutting back on the java, but until that happens totally,  Gatorade mitigate the effects  So the next time you think of that high school boys or girls varsity captain who you loved but never got the time of day from drinking this on the sidelines, just take comfort.  Idiots like me use Gatorade too."
1.0,five year off exp date... skip it!!!,"The cans are from Thailand. The exp date on the bottom of all the cans received reads 07. The contents of the only can I opened are solid, like a rock... There is very little moisture left in the can. It looks like a relabeled can. Amazon refunded my purchase price - I love Amazon :) peace"
5.0,Greatest Sunflower Seeds,"Good quality, and very reasonable. I also like the sunflower seeds from BJ's but it has too much salt, no doubt they test good but they are more expensive and too much salt is not good either. Seeds from Bergin Nut Company are just right. I will continue to buy from this supplier."
1.0,No comparison to Via,"I compared Cafe Bustelo Instant to Starbucks Via Instant Italian Roast after reading some of the reviews on this site. I don't get it. Bustelo is not good at all. It may be better than most other instant coffee brands, I haven't tasted them all, but it doesn't taste like brewed coffee or espresso. Perhaps if you camouflage it with enough sugar and milk it's passable, but I tried it black. I generally avoid instant coffee but recently decided to try Starbucks Via Italian Roast (also black). I was surprised at how good it was, very close to brewed. I think it's too expensive to substitute for brewed coffee on a daily basis, but if you need an instant coffee occasionally for convenience it's very good. Bustello Instant on the other hand was not drinkable in my opinion."
5.0,Best Beans,"Larry's Beans were given to me at Christmas as sort of a Joke ( I go by ""Larry"")  but I was blown away!  Way better that that other brand from Washington state.  Never burned, always smooth.  I have tried 9 different types of Larry's Beans and have never been disappointed.  Even the decaf (Sammy Decaf Jr) is terrific.  I will continue to use it and give as a unique gift."
5.0,worked for me,I enjoyed these.  They arrived in good condition.  Tasted as expected.  Good value for the product.  I will definitely buy them again.
1.0,Bad taste!,"I left positive feed back, the seller was prompt in getting me the tea, the problem is that the taste it TERRIBLE!!!  I compared this tea to another brand and there is nothing simular in the smell or flavor.  This tea is really bad, unless you like moldy pond scum flavor.  I had my sister try it, and she had very simular comments.  Neither me nor my sister could possible drink this tea.  I have since tried to contact the seller two times, and has never responded. Always, taste the product before leaving a review."
1.0,Such a disappointment,"I bought this because a coffee shop in the area has a delicious carmel apple cider, and I mistakenly thought this was going to be as good.  It's not.  The flavor is not natural."
1.0,Extremely high sodium - TOO SALTY,"OMG, I thought my blood pressure would hit the walls of my artery and instantly kill me after eating just one papadum.  This food needs to be repackaged to contain less sodium content.  It currently has 620 mg and the daily sodium intake is 2300 mg. So who can eat just one papadum w/o going over their sodium requirement!  WARNING: If you have high blood pressure or hypertension, do NOT buy this product ... you will be killing yourself!!"
1.0,Not so great.,"I bought these to write on candy coated cake pops for valentines day. The red pen made it through about a dozen hearts and then the tip started to break down so the writing got really slopping. After a few sloppy hearts, the ink started to dry up. I wouldn't buy this again."
5.0,"Awesome wholesome, healthy treats","These granola bars are the best! Where do I begin? Nature Valley bars are 100% natural, include no high fructose corn syrup, contain a good source of whole grain, include no trans fat, and total caloric and carbohydrate intake are relatively low. These bars are perfect for breakfast or can be consumed as a snack. I'm a health nut and I approve these bars without question [and I'm pretty picky about all the information I have posted above)!! The only minus (if anything) is that the bars are quite crunchy/hard; therefore, if you are one with sensitive teeth, you might want to break down the bars into bite size pieces or soak the bars in yogurt or milk [if necessary]. But, do yourself a favor and try Nature Valley crunchy granola bars!!"
1.0,scraps-not shells,Purchased two packages of the 10-count Stand 'N Stuff shells. Out of twenty shells only five were intact. Very poor packaging on this product.
5.0,My Fave Green,"I enjoy Harney and Sons teas.  The tea that comes in bags is real, loose tea, not the powdered sludge and it is in the ease of a tea bag.  Each bag can brew two cups of tea.  DO NOT overbrew your green tea if you are a novice, you will get a bitter cup.  The Chinese Flower has become my favorite green tea, the flower is soft and subtle, and there's a refreshing hint of lemon.  This is a delicate soft green tea.  I hope you like it.  If you do you may also want to try the Bangok by Harney and Sons it has a subtle coconut flavor with lemongrass."
5.0,perfect gift for every occasion,"This gift basket is perfect for someone you love, and they'll definitely love it too. I've sent this gift to my mom and she's very happy with all the goodies inside.  She said that she feels spoiled!"
5.0,dental clean for cats,Great!what can I say about this one between the greenies cat treats and the crunh n clean both are good for keeping your cats teeth clean and healthy.But crunch and n clean was reccommend to me by a friend which cat help remove almost 95%of plaque and tartar from your cats teeth.IT states vets recommend it and this is a plus for me.
5.0,Excellent,"Order this item for the office every month or so. They always have timely shipping, and the coffee is always great."
1.0,Stay Away from this company,"This is a rip off.  Found out that you can buy this product for under $2.00 just about anywhere, not the $7.99 they charge.  In fact you can go directly to the manufacture and order.  Do not get rip-off."
5.0,If you like the slight taste of fruit....,"and I do!!  This new product from Nabisco is definitely worth your money.  If what you want is a light cracker/cookie with a hint of cranberry taste this is the one for you.  Although the label says ""oats"" I cannot detect the taste or consistency of oats in this product.  It crunches in your mouth like a graham cracker but has that slight taste of cranberries in it.  This would be nice with a cup of tea or coffee by your side.  Definitely would buy this again."
1.0,Beef Jerky Goes Bad?,"What a rip off.  We opened the bag and a day later there was wispy white mold on it.  The whole bag had to be thrown out.  It even smelled a little ""off"".  You're better off buying it at the store."
1.0,What is this again??,"Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee."
5.0,Great Snack!!!,I LOVE these things.  They get rid of hunger pangs.  Forget the Snickers bars...grab these!!!!
1.0,Bring back Flavia,"It's like flavored water, but not actually coffee.  I know when it was MARS FLAVIA it used to be great.  When the switch was made to ALTERRA, they promised the same quality coffee, but -honestly -it's quite different.  There's none of the aroma I enjoy about coffee in this stuff that's brewed.  Just buy your coffee from the grocery store -any of them will rank better than this Alterra junk.  Don't waste your money.  Maybe if they bring back Flavia coffees I will venture to try it again.  It's a real shame, because now I have this $200 machine sitting in my office that serves no purpose except to maybe lend a ""contemporary"" look to the office decor.  Well, I guess it still makes hot water."
1.0,bait and switch,I ordered what I thought was a really good deal of Swiss Miss K cups for 19.99. they stated that there were 44 cups on sale. Great! When the package got to our house there were only 12. I don't know who made the mistake or the company just wanted to get more sales but Amazon gave me my money back.
5.0,Stink free litter box spray,"I had been purchasing the Stink Free Litter Box Spray at a retail pet store, but they discontinued the product.  Thankfully I found it at Amazon . . . it really works.  I have two indoor kitties who both use one litter box.  I spray this product on the cleaned litter every morning and the litter and box smell like baby powder - so their area stays un-stinkey."
1.0,Not full container,"I squeezed out all the product I could into a 2 ounce plastic bottle to be able to get through TSA screening.  That it should do, BUT LESS than 2 ounces came out.  See two photos on product page"
1.0,Like Strong Tea,"We like a good tasting regular or breakfast blend in our house. Nothing so strong that it leaves you with an upset stomach. Lately, we've been trying a variety of the organic coffees offered on Amazon. Unfortunately, this on was a major disappointment. It's more like strong tea. Our standard measure, with a fine grind, is 6 standard tablespoon sized scoops for a 12 cup drip coffee maker. This coffee was so weak that it didn't even taste like coffee. The second pot, I used 10 scoops, which was a little better, but still had no distinctive coffee aftertaste. If I have to do that, it's a poor value. Our baseline is the Dunkin Donuts regular ground coffee, which smells and tastes like a good cup of Joe. Since coffee cannot be returned, I have to purchase something to mix with this at home, or give it away (I don't know anyone that would want it if I don't like it)."
1.0,What are these cereal bits in my candy?,"When I opened my first box of Strawberry Delight Frosted Mini Wheats this morning, I thought I had bought something other than cereal by mistake.  I was expecting something like the usual Frosted mini wheats, with the exception of some pink frosting and perhaps some strawberry flavor.  How wrong I was.  Instead, I got a little square of frosting, colored by a pink not found on this Earth and ""scented"" the with the strongest chemical candy perfume that I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It hovered over the box like a pink cloud before taking out a mallet and knocking me into a diabetic coma. There were a few twigs of what was supposed to be cereal, but it was abundantly clear that the frosting is the reason for this stuff, and the twigs are merely a crumb being thrown to caring parents, so they will serve this stuff instead of a nutritious meal. Indeed the only nutritional claim on the box is wrong: the box says that one serving contains 25% of a day's allowance of fiber, when the nutritional information clearly says a serving of this stuff  has only 20% of a day's allowance of fiber. Which one is it?  I don't think that the fiber question will matter to the other reviewers,  with most of them eating the confection out of hand as a snack.  Sadly that means they are getting a whole heck of a lot more than the suggested serving of 24 tiny squares of frosting. Happily, that means they'll likely get a whole day's supply of fiber, but they'll also end up with a week's supply of sugar.  Once in a while, I have order food from Amazon that does not suit my taste.  This cereal is one of those items.  Usually, I donate the unopened packages to the local food pantry and count it as some good coming from my lesson.  I can't even do that with these this so-called cereal.  In poor homes, the children already consume too many processed foods and simple carbohydrates (sugar, in this case).  I am not going to add to the bad eating habits of the next generation."
5.0,"It's indeed ""bold"" but good",Newman's K-cup coffee is indeed bold coffee which I like but it's best if you have cups that can accommodate the largest brewing setting on the Keurig machine. My wife thinks the coffee is too strong but I presume Newman's makes a milder form which I have not been able to find. I also like the idea that the Newman brand supports a charity.
5.0,Delicious! But why the massive price increase?,"Yes, you can use this for salads, but it makes chicken sandwiches delicious, and is also a wonderful dip for fries (throw away your ketchup!). How good does it taste? Well, my 6 year old son, who normally runs away screaming from any green vegetables, begs me to give him lettuce or other green vegetables when they have been tossed with salad cream. Heinz, why don't you sell this in the USA? You would make a fortune. Thank you Amazon for this great 6 pack.  Edit (April 2011): The price has recently increased 66%, which is very disappointing. I've lowered my rating to 3 stars because this is no longer good value.  Edit (Jan 2012): The price has come back down again to what it was originally. Thank you Amazon! Back to 5 stars again!"
1.0,Dangerous to pets and kids,I bought a Victor fly trap and hung it from a post.  Two weeks later both my dogs were very sick.  I then realized that the glue holding the bag of bait to the plastic lid had let loose and dumped a bag full of stinky bait ant dead flies onto the ground.  My dogs ate this concoction and became very sick.  Now I've got a $235 vet bill because of a defective fly trap.  Do not buy this brand.
1.0,Awful Texture and Taste,Ordered Galil Roasted Chestnuts after watching a Dr Oz show.  We expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted.  Instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut.  Horrible tasting. We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
5.0,Yummy,This Mac & Cheese is really creamy without tasting processed and it has the right amount of salt. Very good product overall.
5.0,This is the best grilling spice I have ever tasted!!!,"This is the best grilling spice I have ever tasted, great on steak and grilled potatoes. They have a spice for almost any type of meat.  I also really enjoy the poultry spice. Original is the best but low sodium is also good.  I have been using this for the last 15 years and people always comment about how good my tri tip and steaks are.  The key secret is Mansmiths grilling spice."
5.0,Will never buy store bought extract again.,"These beans were amazing for the price.  Plump, moist and delightful smelling. Made 1.5L of extract with them using silver rum for the alcohol."
1.0,Yuck!,"These Jordan almonds were horrible.  They were mushy and the coating was about half an inch thick.  It made you afraid to break your teeth if you tried eating one.  I ordered them to put in my cousins bridal shower favors, but didn't end up using them."
1.0,terrible,this stuff is terrible...not much more to say....i always use the butterball kits for all my bigger meats but this one is just bad..i guess i'll stick to the cajun kit
5.0,sugar free cinnamon,I really love cinnamon so being able to eat sugar free cinnamon candy that tastes like it has sugar in it when it doesn't is great
1.0,BEWARE!,"I ordered the item pictured, Decaf House Blend ""Espresso Cappuccino"" but received Decaf House Blend ""Melange Maison"" in a completely different package.  The order is completely wrong and is not returnable.  I ordered this online because I could no longer find it locally.  The Melange Maison is available at local grocery stores.  Live and learn."
5.0,Very Sweet and Great to eat,Hey these chocolate covered cherries are very good and are bagain compared to many other options. The only problem is if you eat to many in a short time you may gain weight :-) A great product at a great price. Enjoy
1.0,Bergin brazil nuts were stale upon arrival,"For the first time in over 2 years the nuts are stale. A great disappointment!! I'm toasting them a few at a time, which is a nuisance. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS SHIPMENT ARRIVED IN LATE NOVEMBER 2011 not March...."
5.0,delicious,good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
5.0,former Vermonter,This has a nice full flavor. i thought that since this isn't made in Vermont it wouldn't be very good but it's just fine.
5.0,Another Amazon Winner,Fresh  I opened one pound and put in containers. The plan is both plain old munching as well as to use on top of fresh baked pretzels (soft pretzels). Less salt and more flavor. I was paying a small fortune at Trader Joe's for a similar product.
5.0,no sulfites makes this treat perfect,I love dried apricots but they are all treated with sulfites to maintain their color and I can't eat them then. These gems from stretch island solve the problem. They are portable tasty treats. Try all the flavors!
1.0,Simply Awfull!,"I've been trying various bedtime tea's & this one tastes horrible!! The first cup I tried I thought it was because i'd ate something just before drinking it & mabie that affected the taste, but I made myself another cup this evening at least 2 hrs. after eating & it was all I could do to finish it. I won't be drinking anymore Yogi tea, that's for sure!"
1.0,BUYER BEWARE,"This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix. He loved the flavor and it served as a great distraction if we wanted to clean his ears or trim his dew claws. Unfortunately, with one swift bite he popped the roller ball into his mouth and down his throat. We needed to rush him to the emergency room where they induced vomiting and then monitored closely for 2 days at home until he threw it up on his own .... After surfing the internet we found numerous other claims with people having the same issue- some even needing to spend a few thousand on procedures to remove the ball.  Additionally, customer service for this company was a HUGE disappointment.  They were unshmpathetic and kept on about how it was not meant for chewing."
1.0,Bony and spiky,This is the worst product that I've ever had.  It is spiky and bony.  I am surprise no one has yet choke on it.  I would never buy this again.  The more expensive Spanish imports taste much better than this without the spiky bones.
1.0,Awful product,Caramel was extremely old and couldnt be used. Had to throw it all away. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY IT. I WANT MY MONEY BACK...it was a waste of time. Would give zero stars if I could.
5.0,Pamela's is the absolute best!,"Just like Pamela's Amazing Bread Mix, her ""Ultimate Baking Mix"" is by far the best gluten free baking mix I've ever experienced. Simple to use and the recepies on the bag are unbeatable! Waffles are my granchildrens favorite and my zucchini, pumpkin and banana breads are  favorites at ""pot-lucks."" This mix lends itself to experimenting and coming up with your own delicious alterations. If there were ten stars available on this review, I'd give Pamela's Baking Mix all ten of them!**********"
5.0,Communion Crackers,The product was received in a very timely manner and was as described.  I would order again from this individual.
1.0,Don't buy them,"I guess when I bought these I thought the box would be bigger and the items would be too.  It's a tiny box with tiny items for a huge price.  The box arrived smashed, so the bars inside were smashed as well, and they are not like oreo cookies -- they have cookie bits on the bottom with a little marshmallow on top.  These aren't satisfying, although they'd be ok if I hadn't paid so much for them!  Way too costly.  It's better and more satisfying to eat two Oreo cookies."
5.0,Delicious and nutritious,"These are amazing, very delicious, easy to make - only about 20 minutes to cook on stove, or make it overnight in slow cooker. Everyone in our family, including our picky 2 year old likes these. We add a little bit of cheese or fruit for more taste, but they are good plain too."
5.0,"Exactly as Advertised, Great Value","These are a great value. Just be aware that these are lightly salted, which might taste pretty bland if you are used to lots of salt."
5.0,A coffee Snob is born!!,"I love Coffee and Teas, I would have never thought of myself as a snob, but my husband said that I was....I love espresso and have been using the Tassimo Coffee Unit. I love the espresso that this machine provides, as I no longer worked , being retired and Starbucks went by the way side.  I never really tried all the flavored coffees or teas,  But, with time on my hands  and a visit from one of my friends who happened to bring her own syrups along ....found that I had been missing  ... a coffee and tea snob was made that day.  I have health issues and fighting steroids, sugar has been on my list to watch...so sugar free was what I first purchased....not as good as Deb' had been .... so when I was on line to Amazon for Tessimo coffee and find that Starbucks no long offer their units, went for a coffee I grew up with, Maxwell House.  Ran across Amoretti Premium Raspberry Syrup .....NOT sugar free but what Deb's had brought....I thought YES!  Yes!  to all!! Sugar and tea and coffee.  For service, a fast delivery and I was on my way ....YUM ...  this is just the beginning....Wanting more flavors ...Yes! ....Maxwell House is still good to the last drop....the last drop is also good!"
5.0,Worked in less than 24hrs!,"Once you learn the correct way to set this trap it works! The first time I set this trap I had it turned the wrong way in the gopher hole (it was a large hole with multiple entrances). The gopher stuffed it full of dirt. After seeing this, I turned the trap so the opening faced a different tunnel. I also made sure I covered the hole and area around trap so no light or air would get into the gopher hole. I was careful about not putting too much dirt on the trigger mechanism. I also put baby carrots and peanut butter in the back of the trap. In less than 24hrs (I set it at night and rechecked in the morning) I had 1 of the critters that has been destroying my yard for the last several months. This trap works well if you take your time setting it up. You need to find a fresh hole and make sure this trap is flush with the gopher tunnel. You do have to dig a bit in your yard as this larger then some of the other traps on the market.  Also, a word of advice, make sure you know the critter type you are trying to trap. At first, I thought I had moles because I had piles of large dirt mound around my yard and the holes under the mounds were plugged. From what I read I thought it was a mole but I received some good local advice and they said I had gophers. Don't buy into the horseshoe shaped mounds theories about gopher holes. None of mine were horseshoe shaped and I caught a gopher. Hope this helps!"
1.0,Doesn't Dissolve In Water,I was really disappointed.  How can this be called a drink mix when it doesn't dissolve in water?  80% to 90% of it settles immediately on the bottom.  A waste of money for me.
1.0,One star is the minimum - I would give 0 stars -What kind of subscription is this if they DOUBLE the price from time to time?,"First they changed from 4 boxes to 3 and charged more, then they lowered the price again to maintain the customers, now they have DOUBLED the price again!!  I just imagine how people would react if another type of subscription went up to double price from time to time, and you only realize it when it arrives in your mailbox.  It's not the product that is in question, it's the marketing"
1.0,Black Dried Seaweed,"I followed the directions, and the black burnt like crips multiplied within a few minutes.  I was under the impression that seaweed was green.  It appeared as if I was about to prepare a brew of tea.  I do not recommend this product.  Buy the stuff in the store, and actually review the expiration date.  Totally grossed out all the people in my office.  I initally wanted to add the seaweed to my miso soup."
5.0,better than sugar,This is a natural sweetener and when shipped free is cheaper than driving (with gas prices so high) to a whole foods or nature store to find it.  Thank you Amazon for having it available.  My husband is diabetic and makes a peach tea using a sucralose peach-flavored tea with the stevia that keeps him from the sugar-sweetened drinks.
1.0,Confused,Bought this product to increase my milk supply after reading reviews but it's just arrived and it says not suitable to take when nursing so now I'm not sure if it's safe to take. Very disappointed
1.0,Didn't not like at all,Didn't not like this at all. Didn't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash. I don't recommend at all. I rather stick with the old fashion oatmeal. It comes out just right.
1.0,disgusted beyond belief,"Until I find out what the foreign object was in this that made me sick, I would hold off on using this product. More information to come......."
5.0,Also bought this previously,I had bought these previously and was glad to find them again on Amazon.  Not too blueberry but just enough of a hint and true to flavor.
5.0,Vegetarian Staple,This is a must have for vegetarians for the pantry.  Handy uses galore as a substitute for ground beef.  Comes out of the can in great condition.  I love this on tortillas and in chili.
5.0,"same as always, great kit kat","These kit kats are great, they are the same as the regular ones but just orange colored. I will be passing these out to trick or treaters."
5.0,JUST LIKE THE MOVIES!!! SOOOOO GOOD!!,I've never tasted anything like it other than the movie theater! It is the absolute best! I hope they sell some more because I am ready to buy! Awesome product!
5.0,My Dogs Are CRAZY About These!,"When I ordered these, I thought they were a bit pricey, but I decided to give them a try anyway.  I'm glad I did!  My dogs absolutely love these dried liver treats.  And, since my dogs are all small, I can cut the treats in half and still have large enough pieces to satisfy them. They're great for training; I'll definitely order them again, and would recommend them to anyone."
5.0,Take a sharp object to defend your self,"Unlike most people, I prefer not a weak coffee but a milder roast than the burnt stuff most coffee houses make that requires many accoutrements to mask like cream, sugar and artificial flavors. Therefore, I purposely only tried the Columbian.  I work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee ""dispensing machines."" They are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day-to-day basis. Some time just your coins back. A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.  Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual.  Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave.  Shake contents to bottom of pack.  Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth.  Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds.  Add a tad of ice. Hope I can make it back to my desk before the cup empties.  I was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however I think it is the addition of the micro-ground coffee that adds the edge necessary.  In any event you owe it to yourself to try it."
5.0,"TIMOTHY'S MIDNIGHT MAGIC, EXTRA BOLD K-CUPS","I've been using this coffee, (Timothy's K-cups Midnight Magic, extra bold.) for about a year. This is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee of all K-cups. When we make it we use the small cup, but make a double small cup by lifting the lid a bit then closing it for the Keurig to recycle which makes one extra large cup, so be sure to use an extra large cup or it ""shall runnith over"". The coffee comes out excellent like this and is still a bit bold. We also use ""International Delight"" coffee creamer as it is non dairy (Great for us geezers with a lactose intolerent problem.) and we only use a much smaller amount to achieve the same lightness as milk, unless we use the fat free variey, in which case we have to use much more which waters down the coffee. For the litle bit that we use we can afford that tiny bit more fat in the creamer. This combination makes for a rich and bold cup of coffee. We order 3 double packs for a total of 144 K-cups each month."
1.0,Problems,Second Bag of the product and my 10 year Lab is still experiencing problems with diarrhea.  We switched to Blue Buffalo Weight Control because our Chocolate Lab was starting to put on weight with Pro Plan Large Breed.  Seems to like eating the food but on his daily walks he has to stop 3 to 4 times from his normal on stop with the dropping always remaining consistent.  The Vet informed us this is a common problem with this product.  Maybe just his system but problem corrected days after changing his food only.
5.0,Very Tasty,"I grew up eating Red Vines and I liked them very much, but it's been ages and ages since I've eaten licorice. I don't why, I do eat candy on occasion, but licorice I just stopped eating, until last week when I tried these. They do kind of remind me of Red Vines. The flavor is different, of course, then I remember. These are pomegranate flavored, but it's been ages and ages plus years since I've eaten a pomegranate, so I can't swear that they've gotten the flavor right, but that being said, these are very tasty."
5.0,Mama Mia!,"When I first looked at this sauce at our local Publix, I was a startled to see large cloves of garlic and whole leaves of basil floating around. Well, I just had to try it. Delicious! A wonderful, fresh taste but not highly acidic (as young/fresh sauce can be) as I'd feared, which is a good thing because of my acid reflux. The garlic pieces weren't at all hot or bitter. They were soft and creamy and, with the basil, added a sweet element to the sauce...which is a good thing because there are plenty of them, and I didn't relish the idea of picking them out.  A bit pricier than what I normally buy, but the taste is worth the extra expense. Like the other reviewer said: very chunky. So bear that in mind if you buy. I put mine in smaller one-cup containers and froze them as I'm cooking for one and didn't want any excess to go to waste. Thawed perfectly and with no discernable difference in taste or texture.  Love it plain with rotini."
1.0,Not that good,I was very happy to see a suger free option for cake but disappointed when I tried it.  It leaves a bad aftertaste.  It is not light and fluffy.  It has the texture of cornbread.  Will not purchase again.
1.0,Awful stuff,"My rabbit won't eat pellets and there is no food around here that has no pellets so I decided to get this because, although it contained pellets, they look darker and larger. I was hoping they tasted different and they probably do and that maybe my rabbit would give it a chance. In my opinion, it smelled like cigarette ash and my rabbit wouldn't eat it and just avoided it. I can't stand the smell and it seems my rabbit can't either but I spent $16 on this in Petco. I ordered a new bag of Kaytee Rainbow Rabbit food that smells like play-doh and paint and last time it ate every piece to give you an idea of how bad this is. I strongly would NOT recommend it."
5.0,Health Nut Gone Astray,"These are the best chips I've ever ate!  As the other reviewer said, it will deep six diets on a global scale.  I thought olive oil chips were good, but these are untouchable.  You can inhale a bag in one sitting.  Geesh, I wish they would have never made these."
1.0,dont buy from this company,I would NOT buy from this company again. when the pro treats came they were already expired by over two months. costimer service was not help full and did NOT give me a refund or exchange the product for a new one.  custmer service was the worst I have ever experience. I even sent them the upc code and the copy of the sale receipt and I still did not get a refund or exchange of product.  I woud NEVER buy fromt them again. I recommend you dont either.
5.0,Great Product! Amazing taste and healthy too! The PERFECT SNACK!,"Great products, love the flavors and variety. The fact that it can be a healthy snack as well helps and I plan to eat much more of these..I am eager for them to continue to produce new flavors but I love what they already have. I highly recommend this product as a substitute for chips or other less healthy snacks...YOU WILL LOVE THIS!"
5.0,Best tea ever,"Addicted to this bright, strong tea for breakfast. Have not found another like it - wish it was available in the States!"
1.0,Yuck,Does not taste like peanut butter at all.  Leaves a foreign taste in your mouth that does not taste natural.  Avoid this product if you're looking for a viable alternative for peanut butter.
1.0,Resist Temptation!,"Bottom line, these taste like cheap hotel coffee. Your least favorite Nespresso capsule variety is 100X better tasting than these capsules. Taste is what matters, ECC capsules are awful.  This goes for Cremoso, Indiad'oro, Espressivo - unfortunately, I bought all three types. Hardly a difference between them, but I listed them in awful to undrinkable order.  However, if that's not enough of a reason to avoid, consider these;  -they're difficult to insert in Nespresso machines -they're difficult to remove from Nespresso machines -they frequently blister during brewing, thus ""brewing"" coffee from the side of the capsules -they are stale right out of the package (though the expiration date reads otherwise) -all ten per box are not quite vacuum-sealed in plastic, hence opening the plastic hastens further spoilage -they are only a dime less than real Nespresso capsules!!!  I actually threw away unused capsules, they were that bad. They are not worth free. Quite weak for a company started by a former Nespresso executive. Perhaps they have a serious quality control issue in the U.S.?"
1.0,"Annie Chun's Seaweed Snacks, Roasted Sesame,","Maybe they're an acquired taste. I don't know, but I'm working on it. I have 12 packs. Each 0.35 ounce package contains 20 - 2 1/2""X 2""wafer-thin sheets of seaweed. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like these. If you never had them, try one bag and not the pack of 12."
1.0,I cannot in all good conscience be a guinea pig for this company again,"I had high hopes for this company's line of hair products. The prices were good (meaning cheap) and the promises which were made seemed made just for me -- how exciting. My hair, which is brittle, damaged and fragile would as a result look pretty, I imagined! The first thing which I reviewed was a shampoo. In retrospect, I realize that it simply had little effect upon my hair but was beginning the spiral downward which would continue with all the otehr products I have ordered from this line. The nadir was the horrible hair cream in a jar which I tried right before this product arrived. I had already ordered this product.  After I used the hair cream, I broke my hair trying to comb it through and I needed to shampoo it over and over to get the grease out.  I know that many people of color defended that product, but unless it was written on the jar that it was especially made for certain hair types of ethnic origin the company did a disservice to all of us. I have never felt so unattractive in my life, as when my hair was broken off and ruined by this company. If you, as a reader of this review, think that I, who was not born yesterday, plan to try this final product which I ordered when I didn't realize what could possibly happen if I used one more thing from this company, you don't know me. I review many things, and I truly call them as I see them. The company selling this makes a perfectly dreadful product to my mind.  Sorry for the strong words but nobody messes with my hair!"
5.0,They work!,My pomeranian is the sweetest little dog... with the WORST breath EVER!  These chews help keep her breath under control!  They are a bit pricey when given one a day but...  her kisses are worth it!  Plus... she actually loves em!  She doesnt even know she is brushing her teeth!
5.0,heinz hot dog relish.,My husband loves this product and our local store that sold this has been out of it for a while needed to order enought til they restock
1.0,Rice and Oatmeal Cereals - Toxic Hexane,"The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.  Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead."
5.0,Really like this stuff both the black rasperry and mango,I found this on my local store grocery shelf but it is much cheaper on amazon.  I really like this stuff - not your regular sparkling water.
5.0,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. Natural. Low calorie. Nice Italian tomato flavor with mini pasta. Lower sodium compared to most soups. Flavor balance well created. Low calorie choice. Great with a couple slices of your favorite crispbread or some whole grain crackers. Low calorie, healthy instant lunch ""anytime"" option. Nice for your desk drawer, traveling, or anywhere you can get some hot water. 100 calories, 4g protein, and 360mg sodium per cup. Important to let stand re-covered as recommended for 7+ minutes and then stir well. Nice vegan ""top up"" for those not yet on Amazon Prime and might need another item to qualify for Super Saver Shipping. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews and the vegancompassion Profile for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" & all the other helpful ""Vegan Grocery"" Listmania.

1.0,failed experiment,"I am combining white and whole-grain flours for my bread machine (60% white+40% brown) resulting in a ""half brown"" loaf of bread. Whole-grain flour needs a ""booster"" to properly rise and to get a more airy, less dense texture. I ordered several brands of ""Dough enhancer"" from Amazon to compare and to try out of them. I tried Barry Farm's in accordance with the suggested usage but the result was disappointing. The bread not only rose less than usual but the crust got severely burned - using standard machine setting. The failure was so palpable that I discarded the product after only one application. I found other enhancers from Amazon which worked wonderfully."
1.0,Packaging is very misleading,"This review is about the 8-pack Nonni's biscotti.  These biscotti taste quite good, but are pricey.  I thought the price was acceptable, however, because I could see there was room for at least 10 biscotti of the size shown in the front window of the box.  I was very disappointed, therefore, to find that 1/5 of the package width is taken up with empty plastic, and there were actually only 8 biscotti.  I wrote to Nonni's to complain and was told they were re-designing their packaging.  The new packaging is even worse: now, on the back side of the package, you can see parts of 2 biscotti, and it looks like there is room for 12 or even 14 biscotti of that size in the package, but again, a significant fraction of the box is empty filler.  The count is not listed on the front of the package; you have to read the fine print of the nutrition information label to find that a serving is 1 biscotti and there are only 8 servings in the package.  On the Nonni's website, the nutrition information label associated with the 8-count box has a blank ""Servings Per Container""."
5.0,Love Popchips!!,"I love Popchips.  Favorite flavors are Cheddar, Sea Salt and Vinegar, and Salt and Pepper.  They are low in calories and lower in sodium so when I get a craving for potato chips, I grab a bag of Popchips."
5.0,Convenient and refreshing,"As with Kool-Aid, I didn't have really high expectations of the flavor of this product, but it does taste like tea and does taste sweet.  I add one good squirt to a pint glass full of water, and it's a satisfying thirst-quencher for during workouts.  I also like the portability of the bottle.  No it's not ""real"" tea, but if you like Crystal Light, diet sodas or sports drinks, this is a convenient alternative that doesn't require shaking or stirring."
1.0,Never buying here again,"This is probably the worst purchase I've ever made on the internet, and I'm a frequent consumer of online purchases.  Firstly, this product was not shipped 3 weeks after I ordered it.  After emailing the company inquiring into my order, I was informed that they would now ship my product - 3 weeks after the order date!  Upon arrival of the purchase, I noticed a misshapen box on my doorstep.  Upon opening the box, I discovered my Fruit Snacks box was misshapen and squished, because it was placed in a shipping box that was smaller than the fruit snacks box, totally ruining the shape and appearance of the Fruit Snacks box.  In addition, under the fruit snacks box was a crumpled packing slip, which included a coupon for 5% off my next purchase from this company.  It's too bad the coupon expired 3 days before I even received the fruit snacks box, since the coupon was printed three weeks prior, when I actually ordered the thing.  Tl;dr DO NOT purchase stuff from this company.  It is worth the extra time needed to find another supplier or buying it from the store.  I paid more for this product than it's price at costco citing convenience due to not having to leave my home, and ended up experiencing the worst online purchase in my 10 years of purchasing history."
5.0,Excellent,I tried tasting this salt by itself and then tasting some other brands of sea salt that I happened to have.  No doubt that this was the best tasting with no weird bitter or metallic after taste.
1.0,This is not a Tassimo product!,This was advertised by Amazon as a product that can be used with a Tassimo coffee maker. It can't! The coffee is packaged in a round tea bag. This is incompatible with the Tassimo coffee maker!!!
1.0,Dog rejected food,My dogs - all 3 mini poodles would not touch the canned Innova Evo. I ended up giving it to a neighbor for her dog LOL. They all chow down the Innova Evo dry dog food.
1.0,SCAM.,"SHAME on you Amazon for allowing such crooked, HIGHLY over priced item to sell on your site. I'm talking about ""NESTLE COFFEE CREAMER VANILLA CARAMEL SUGAR FREE POWDER 10.2-oz. Sold by Mancor and fulfilled by.....wait for it..........Amazon.  $!5.00 for 1 10.2-oz jug, bottle, jar.  OUTRAGEOUS.  Does Amazon not screen for deceptive sale practices?"
5.0,"Very authentic and spicy, tastes great with some basmati rice, great for beef too.","This is the authentic product, I can vouch for it since I am from India. The ITC Hotel chefs who created this recipe are very well regarded in India. Its just the right mix for a spicy lamb curry, all you need to do is mix it with water and add the lamb and then let it simmer on your stove for 30-45 minutes to bring out the aromas and flavors. Really convenient and time saving.  The lamb curry paste is spicier than a butter chicken curry mix. The chicken curry usually has a more creamy consistency and is sweeter due to higher content of tomatoes. The lamb curry has a base of garlic, ginger, black pepper, onions, tomatoes and other highly aromatic Indian spices (bayleaf, cinnamon, star anise, cardamom, cloves, black cardamom, shah jeera, corriander seeds, red chilli powder etc.).  I usually make my own curry as I prefer fresh ingredients but this mix is wonderful, it has just the right blend of spices that go into lamb curry. The secret to Indian food is to lower the flame once a curry boils and then simmer it for quite some time. This step is not a must if you're in a tearing hurry but it unlocks the real flavors.  Once done this curry keeps very well in the refrigerator. In fact, as with all spicy curries, it even tastes better the next day. I use two packets at a time to make an entree for 6 people.  Variations: I sometimes add some 1X1.5 inch cubes of diced potatoes along with the lamb to absorb the spiciness which makes it into a ""Lamb Vindaloo"". Or you can use beef instead of lamb, it will taste great with any red meat that absorbs the spice.  If you're a vegetarian, you can use this curry with potatoes and green peas since the curry paste does not contain any meat in it. Just remember to add peas towards the end of the simmering process or they will get bleached out and you'll get a fantastic dish.  Pairing: Pair this lamb curry with some aromatic basmati rice, cooked till all grains are done but still separate, and a bowl of plain yogurt (with a little sugar if you like) to counter the spiciness. Or you can also buy frozen Indian nan/roti from the local Indian grocery store, toast it in the oven and enjoy. Yummy!"
1.0,yummiest coffee ever.NOT,After scanning the shelves of grocerie stores for the last 10 yrs I finally decided to order a can online. Better than starbucks. Howard Schultz is a scum bag for selling our basketball team. Better coffee and dont have to give my money to a scumbag. Thats a WIN WIN situation.---------------------Backstabber!  I should have recieved and tested it first. This coffee was terrible. Must have been a different roast than what I had years ago. oops sorry. I guess starbucks will remain a guilty pleasure.
1.0,Dr. V,"As many others who reviewed this provider have said, I would never buy from them again. The packaging was pathetic. A three year old could have packed better. Ordered 3 cases of canned food and at least 6 of the cans were smashed to the point that you could barely open them, some you could not. I gave them 1 star because I actually did receive an order. I will go back to Petfooddirect."
1.0,GREAT PRODUCT; BAD ORDER,"Bob's Red Mill products are top notch! Unfortunately, the picture shown in this product is a bag of GLUTEN FREE Buckwheat Cereal. What I received is NOT Gluten Free! From what I understand, returning products to Amazon is not easy. GRRRR!!"
5.0,Simply the BEST!!!,"What can I say....Luscious milk chocolate, melt in your mouth ecstasy, with yummy crunchy hazelnuts.....10.5 ounces of pleasure!  Even better than that, a five pack, with FREE SHIPPING! That's the cheapest price I have found anywhere!"
5.0,My Jack Russell terrier loves these,"This is my second order of these treats.  My dog loves them, and I think they are good for her."
1.0,YUCKKKKK!!! wormy texture,"I wish i read all the 1 star reviews before wasting my money.. i have never tasted something so horrible..i love most  health food so didn't expect to find it this bad..between the fishy smell, the consistency, the texture..everything about it.."
1.0,Flavorless,"I was super excited to try this tea because the price at my local grocery store was only $2.99 for a box. Well, you get what you pay for...this tea is absolutley flavorless. I can see why people say the flavor is light...it is SO light that it tastes like water. Very disappointing. I am running back to Numi Monkey King!"
1.0,SHIPPED ME THE WRONG ITEM,"I ordered an extra large gold cat box, as pictured, and received a medium sized navy and white cat box that my cat would never fit into. I tried to organize a return with Amazon customer service on line and just kept getting re directed. I would not recommend ordering from this seller."
5.0,It's Keurig,"This is the best price out there for K-Cups, I have not found anywhere cheaper. This English Breakfast Tea is fantastic - very bold flavor!"
1.0,Way too expensive!,Seriously?  $25 for 3 bags of chips?  I have been on the waiting list to be notified when they became available for purchase.  I am really disappointed that Amazon is selling them for about 10 times what they are worth.
5.0,Love the new easy packaging!,Definitely the cheapest I've found K-cups for my Keurig.  I don't need heavy extra packaging - I need cheap coffee!!!  This flavor is nice and rich.
5.0,dog treats,"small size makes these great for either treats or training -- I recommend them to my dog obedience classes as an ideal size.  Most importantly, the dogs LOVE them!"
1.0,English custard Delicious !!!,Glad I found this product on line. Used regularly in UK. It is delicious poured over Apple Pie or in trifles.
5.0,rosehips tea,"I've been drinking this tea for 1 year now. I have leg pain whenever it's about to rain. Since I've started drinking this tea, I feel very little, if any, pain in my leg. It also taste great."
1.0,Terrible - not worth the postage,"The product was poorly packaged and leaked in the box.  The truffle oil does not have aromas or flavors of truffle.  When I tried to return it, was ubable becasue it is a gourmet item and perishable.  I have tried many truffle oils in the past and I would not cook with this if it was given to me for free."
1.0,Bad Coffee!,This is the worst coffee ever!!!! Tastes like cheap dollar store coffee!!!!  Do not waste your money!!!! We drink Senseo Coffee and had to buy this in a pinch.....not worth it!
1.0,So Gross!!,I must say I did look at the reviews before buying these but since it seemed like half 5 stars and half 1 star I would gamble.  It turns out the 1 stars were right.  These things shouldnt even have the name of licorice as they taste like they took a chemical bath right before packaging.  If I could give zero stars I would but I just had to warn people about these.
1.0,"Honestly, eat it without milk.",I find this cereal terrible tasting. I'm eating it right now which is what prompted this review.  Upon first opening the package I tried a pinch of them and they tasted all right. Nothing special. Edible and healthy. I can deal with this.  Then I added milk. Now they taste bad. :( It's not the milk either. I had some without the cereal and it tastes fine. I looked at all the goodness on the side of the box and just know that this is a healthier choice but I'm never going to eat these with milk again.
1.0,Ick!,"I don't know a single person that likes these things.  Why do they keep making them, and who the hell is buying them?"
5.0,The last reviewer was right on the money! Excruciatingly good! Ha!,"This is the best Sriracha sauce EVER! The heat is addictive because there is also sweet, salty and notes of garlic and tanginess of vinegar in this sauce that just makes you want to tip the bottle and pour it in your mouth.  I'm seriously considering trying this as a topping on vanilla ice cream just to see what it would be like to have the heat with the cool-down of dairy. What? What? You think I'm crazy now? *innocent look*  Obviously, anyone who forks out the dough for a 12 pack of 28-ouncers is a hard-core sriracha sauce addict and this was super fresh and bright red like I expect it to be and this tall order was shipped in perfect packaging.  Anyone want to lick some sriracha sauce off my finger? *pulls finger away* Oh no you can't! You have to buy it for yourself! *wink*  What is sriracha sauce good for?  Stir fries Egg dishes Rice dishes Meat dishes Barbecues Fish dishes Veggies Soups Stews Pasta Salads Salad dressings Spicy mayo Spring rolls Etc. ad infinitum  The possibilities are limited only to your imagination.  If you already know you love this stuff, this is an excellent deal!  As of this review: 3.80 for each 28 0z bottle at the $45.60 w/free shipping via amazon.com.  Viva the hot stuff and may you all sweat a little, burn a little and love a little.  ;)"
5.0,great deal on great coffee,Got this on an Amazon deal...ended up with 6 pounds of organic coffee for less than $4/pound.  SHoudl have bought more...it is a great coffee.
5.0,Bag of Sours,"Very colorful sour balls packaged just real good.  Will be sucking on sour balls for days, weeks, mondths to come."
5.0,Super Great Taste and Great Nutrition!,I have been eating this for a couple of years now and it is yet another terrific product from Kashi.  Very yummy wheat cereal that is a touch sweet and has great natural cinnamon flavor.  I eat it and I am full for hours and hours just like most Kashi cereals.
1.0,Cookies delicious; packing the WORST!,"I have been a fan of Anna's cookies for years and the ginger have long been my favorites, so when I saw this price I jumped.  Too fast.  The shipment arrived in about 10 days (awfully slow for such a huge company, IMO) - cookies appeared to be well-packed in their own little case.  However we opened them to find that each and every box, of twelve, contained cookie crumbles.  Not one single cookie in shipment arrived unscathed; OK, I guess, to crumble on ice cream, etc. - but definitely not what we'd wanted.  Returning all 12 today; we'll see how Amazon handles that."
5.0,missklibs,"By far, this is one of the best teas that I have ever had before.  As someone who often attends High Tea and collects teas instead of trinkets when vacationing, I have had quiet a lot of tea in my time.  Will be ordering more as my coworkers and I drank up the first tin already and we only had it for about 2 weeks!!!  Good stuff, Maynard!"
1.0,Not A Pure Anise Extract At All. Content 92% Alcohol.,"I am really disappointed by this product. Star Kay White claim to sale 4 oz of Pure Anise Extract. In fact it is 92% alcohol and only 8% Star anise oil. when you buy this product you are buying 3.68 oz of alcohol and only .32 oz of Anise Extract . The product is weak and diluted, not good for my uses. I don't need the alcohol.If you call it pure is must be pure 100% or change the label and publish the details on the site to reflect the true content of the products you sale. Thanks for reading.  Michel Gerard"
1.0,DO NOT feed your cat Fussie Cat foods!!!,"My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.  If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done."
1.0,no it's not worth it,"nor is this item healthy. first, the 'chocolate' bits here do NOT taste all that good. in fact, they taste like the cheapest chocolate you've ever bought on a whim to satisfy a craving (or worse). second the chocolate bits are heavy and sink to the bottom of the bowl. you won't actually get much of the chocolate in the same spoonful as the flakes. finally, the chocolate is waxy, it doesn't melt in your mouth and it's made with a trans-fat. personally... I'd rather buy, chop &/or and shave a REAL 70% or higher chocolate bar & sprinkle that on plain special k. I guarentee it would be a hell of a lot better & healther then this junk."
5.0,great flavor,It is great productand awesome price:-) I purchase it because my family trying to lose weight without losing the flavor of koolade and sugar. My husband's weight lose of 33lbs was successful by switching to crystal light- No sugar!!!
1.0,loose k-cups,Very tacky to leave loose k-cups - i know that they are sealed but you realize people will drink from these - i just hope its sanitary - i washed them anyway - but still its disgusting....won't be ordering from this person again. Looks like since this is a trend with these types of products maybe i should just order from manufactor - afterall its only a couple of dollars to assure getting factory sealed packages.......  Be ready to wash your product when it arrives.
1.0,"Tastes different, and much worse than before","This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes."
5.0,Kikkoman Kotterin Mirin - Sweet Cooking Seasoning,"I have been making sushi at home for just over a year. many times I would make my own Sushi Rice seasoning from scratch. Now that I started using this product, I don't bother with making it from scratch.  I also use it when making plain rice dishes like teriyaki salmon\chicken. People can't believe how good the rice is.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS (if you have a sweet tooth)."
1.0,Tasted Moldy!,"I really did not want to give any rating at all.These crackers were absolutely horrible.  They tasted moldy.  According to what I read in the returns policy, I can't get reimbursed.  I am stuck with 9 boxes of yucky crackers and am out $36. I tried three boxes only to find they all contained crackers that tasted moldy. I would not order a food item from Amazon again."
1.0,Packaged in Polystyrene - not good for eating,"Bottom of container is the recycling arrows in shape of triangle with a PS in the center.  From a website regarding food safety and plastics, it says this about PS...  Styrene can leach from polystyrene plastic. Styrene is toxic to the brain and nervous system among workers with longer- term exposures,16,17 but also adversely affects red blood cells, liver, kidneys and the stomach in animal studies.18  [...]  I have been eating these noodles and really enjoying it and did notice that the sauce was leaching into the bowl after it ""cooked"".  I will think twice before I eat these again."
1.0,Honey is Sub-Par,"This honey was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. The flavor had a pervasive bitterness to it, unlike any clover honey I had tasted in the past, and I could only describe it reminiscent of extremely over-brewed tea. It made me cringe. Its odor also had a certain disagreeability about it; there was sweetness, yes, but it was accompanied by a faint chemical smell like that of petroleum.  Pieces of honeycomb could be seen suspended throughout the honey, which I suppose at least tells you it is authentic, but they are not very pleasant to bite into... like a sticky yet dry piece of shoe leather---impossible to chew through.  Avoid this product."
5.0,These things are addictive....,"I took a chance and ordered the two 4.5 lb. bags of the Albanese brand since the price was considerably lower than others. They arrived soft and fresh, and I'm very happy with the product.  If you've never tried peach rings, I'll try to describe them. They have a melt-in-your-mouth sugary coating which gives way to the sour tart peach flavor of the candy. These are actually a bit more tart than others I've tried, but I like that."
5.0,Love This Stuff!,Fat to Skinny Zero is a wonderful sweetener! I use it in everything from baking to sweet tea. As the bottle claims there is NO aftertaste. It offers all the sweetness of sugar without any guilt for those counting calories or carbs. The price is better than other similar products I have tried... and it is tastier! I go through about a bottle a month. It is small enough to carry in a purse. Anyone interested in this should also check out the Fat To Skinny books. I have found so much success with this life changer! :)
5.0,Buy these cookies!,"Nothing like home-made, especially when you're in a combat zone.  I appreciate all the care packages I get from friends and relatives, but if it's all store-bought stuff...we can buy all that over here.  What we can't replicate is home made!  These cookies are the bomb!!!"
1.0,Poor copy,"This jerky is; tough, fat, has gristle, and does not taste like teriyaki. They do not even try to make it with the right flavorings. If you like teriyaki get another product."
5.0,Kitty finds it tasty,The is Kittys favorite food.  Doesn't eat anything else.  Easy and convenient.  Highly recommend for anyone with a finicky eater.
5.0,Love Them!!!! and so does the my dog!,"This past winter was so cold my fury friend and I didn't venture out much. Then along came Spring, and it rained, and it rained, and it rained.  Again, not out much. In April I noticed she was starting to lose hair on her back end, backside of her legs, and her back sides. :-( After a trip to the vet, I was told she would need about 6mg of Melatonin twice a day till her hair fully returned. Turns out it was happening to a lot of Boxers this year in our area due to the lack of sunlight exposure (cold winter/rainy spring). Well, giving her a heart worm pill every month is tragic in and of itself....we both hate it. So the thought of trying to shove pills down her throat twice a day, EVERY DAY, was not appealing. Then I stumbled across these pill pouches! I can't sing their praises loud enough!!!!!! Made giving her the meds each day like giving her a treat, and that's what she thought too.  We also now give her the heart worm meds in these! Our lives are much less stressful with the help of this wonderful item!  And in case you are wondering.....yes, her hair returned! We now take the supplement once a day just to be sure all is well. She still loves the taste and waits for it each morning! Now, if we could only invent something that would make trimming her toenails less of a wrestling match!"
1.0,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT Eeeeew," Jack Link's Beef Jerky, Peppered, Mega Pack, 10-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2) This order took five days to deliver and this is Florida with high humidity and high heat. Upon receipt I opened each package because I always place in my fridge in gallon zip locks. I ordered two of the mega two-packs and three of the four were fine. The fourth was FULL of mold which was visible through the packaging. I am seriously disappointed (and grossed-out). No returns/exchanges means I will NEVER purchase foods items from Amazon again.  Update: After figuring out a way to contact Customer Service despite their policy of no returns on food items, they credited back 1/4 of total purchase price and offered free next day shipping for this item (which I will not use). Never again."
1.0,Do not buy this!!!,"I never bother to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after my experience with the Baby Brezza.  Right out of the box, this machine did not work.  I had the same issue with it that other reviewers discussed- it steamed but did not blend.  When I called customer service (they do not answer the phone, though they do call you back),  it took us days to actually connect. She insisted that this isn't a problem with the machine, it is a problem with the way it was handled when it was transported.  (???)  Umm... I'm pretty sure if this machine can't handle being shipped, then something is wrong with it.  I was then given directions to open up the machine and told that once I put the belt back on, it will work perfectly.  I couldn't open it up, but my father is an engineer and he opened it up and said that it appears to be very, very poor quality and he doesn't expect it will last long.  I spent $100 on this!  Please save your money- this machine is not good quality and is over-priced!!"
5.0,Vogel Herbamare,Vogel Herbamare is delicious and adds just the right amount of seasoning to any dish I'm making.  All the spices are contained in one container and I don't have to use several to get the right amount.  The price was very reasonable but most of all I didn't have to go to a health food store to buy it!
1.0,Pet food and/or treats from China,"I purchase almost daily from Amazon and recommend Amazon to my friends constantly. I think that makes me a very good customer. I have a very serious concern. When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as ""MADE IN CHINA"". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China. As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!"
1.0,This variety blows,"My review is about the variety rather than this vendor, so unless my experience is an oddity or the vendor's seeds differ this may not apply. The American Yard Long is not anything like the common cucumber variety in markets. It is more like a pale,bad cantaloupe or honeydew melon than a cucumber. Looks exactly like a long melon with seeds in the center. Slightly sweet but not sweet enough to make it a palatable melon substitute. Too tender and sweet to pass for a cucumber."
5.0,Great Buy,"Great buy for the great product, it saves me money and i don't even have to leave my house. I will buy this product again from amazon only."
5.0,Kitty treats,"My cat had dry skin and coat because she only gets dry food and wouldn't eat it if I put oil on it. Fortunately, she loves these treats and now gets the omegas she needs."
5.0,"Convenient, good tasting, minimal Calorie RTD","These taste good, have a moderately thick consistency, and have a high protein content. The biggest selling point to me is the cap, which (in my experience) seals it tight enough to shake the remainder up without worrying about it leaking. I drank half before and half after my workout; the cap allowed me to store the remainder in the work fridge easily.  To me the money spent on this goes towards the convenience of not having to make shakes at work. Will buy again."
1.0,Very poor customer care,The 3 packs of cocoa I had ordered were packed so sloppy that one of the cocoa packs broke during transit.  Needless to say the mess it created in my kitchen when I opened the box.  I sent American Spice 2 emails and complained about the broken package.  Obviously American Spice does not have time for their customers; they never bothered to acknowledge receipt of my emails.  This was my first and my last time doing business with American Spice.
5.0,"Fun to eat, fun to share","I saw these in a local grocery and picked them up because I thought they were cute.  Once I tried them I had to share them with everyone!  They aren't too sweet but will hit the spot if that's what you're craving.  Every time I send a care package to my sister, I make sure to pack some of these!"
5.0,Delicious!,"Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies are delicious! Tasty chocolate on the inside, and an equally tasty cream filling on the inside. Pour yourself an ice cold glass of milk, sit back and try not to eat the whole box in one sitting.  Brian W. Fairbanks"
5.0,Loved it.,Was very happy with order and blue mush tasted really good. Cant wait to to use in other recipes soon.
1.0,Cheesecake may spoil during delivery,"I got a 6 month cheesecake order as a gift, and the first cheeesecake arrived packed in dry ice.  It was frozen and tasted great after a night in the fridge.  The second cheesecake arrived spoiled.  They did not ensure rapid delivery of the cake and the dry ice melted while the cake was in transit.  When I called the company and asked for a replacement, they said that would be impossible, and that I would have to pick another product.  I asked to speak to a manager and the manager acted like it was my fault that the cake spoiled in transit, and said I was lucky that they were willing to give me anything.  I've ordered other month clubs from other companies in the past, and never once had an item spoil prior to delivery.  And on the very rare occasion a product arrived damaged, other companies were very willing to make it up to me.  Amazing clubs made it very clear they had no interest in customer satisfaction."
1.0,bugs included ?,"why is it all 3 pack contains hundred of bugs? I order tea not bug.  I threw it all in the garbage once i opened the package. disgusting , very disappointed in amazon. YOU HAVE BEEN WARN!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,sweet & hot,"If you like spicy things, this is for you. It is tastefully hot!"
1.0,...No,"I really was surprised at how bad this stuff really was.  When I ordered it I figured with ingredients like ginger and lemon that it would make a satisfying hot wintertime drink.  But alas it was downright terrible. I heated the right amount of water as per its directions and found it extremely strong and bitter.  So I added more water and mix and this time added some honey for flavor and still found it too strong, and very unsatisfying.  Finally I cut it with extra water and that was all she wrote, it was still bad.  Worse I feel than the taste of this stuff when actually drinking it was the terrible aftertaste that lasts for some time.  An hour later I could still taste some of it lingering, and it was not at all pleasant.  I do not, and cannot recommend this drink at all...."
5.0,Best whole wheat pancake mix out there,We have a restaurant in town that has whole wheat pancakes that we love so we've tried every box mix that we could find to try and match theirs. The Hodgson Mill Whole Multi Grain mix isn't quite the same but it's as good or maybe better.
1.0,All melted....,"I was so happy when these first arrived, but then I actually looked in the tub and noticed that every single bag of bears was a melted pile of goo.. I can not tell you if these were stale or not, as we have goo. I can tell you that they came exactly as you see in the picture, just with no bears in the bag, cause they are goo...  Do not order these (or any other gummy product) in the summer time, otherwise.. Goo..."
1.0,"ordered tip-500, they shipped tip-400","I ordered this product for my mom. She was looking for Flour Tip-500 but could not find it anywhere else than on Amazon. Well, I was very happy to get it for her but was disappointed when I received the package. What was shipped is tip-400 and not tip-500 as shown on the picture.  I did contact the seller and asked him about it and they said that sometimes ingredients can be different than shown on the picture. Well, this is not a question of ingredients but a totally different product.  After a few emails back and forth and after I had to contact Amazon the funds were refunded."
5.0,Great tasting,"I wasn't a fan of drinking this as it is, so I added some stevia, and it was perfect.  A nice way to get my chocolate fix without consuming any calories."
5.0,good stuff,it smells so good.  No sugar needed.  It tastes just like the boba stores.  I just add a few big scoops into my drink.  I will definitely buy the same ones when I run out.  No need to try others.
1.0,"absolutely terrible, way to spicy","Don,t buy, unless you like strong after tastes, and way to spicy.This is not mongo syrup ,like the way it might be, with some sot spices added in."
5.0,Good alternative,Kid loves this stuff. Excellent alternative after 1yr. My families kids grew up on this. It's a little sweet but I guess it's ok.
5.0,The Sojos catnip,I have a bengal cat and this is the only catnip that give her a buzz. I tried it all and everytime she go away from it. She seems to like this one and become crazy about playing with anything around for like 10-20 mins. This look like HIGH Quality catnip and you can smell it as soon as you open the can. This is ultra high quality stuff and i recommend it for people who think their cats doesnt react to catnip... now they will!
1.0,Dont waste your money,Wish it tasted as good as it smells.  It has no flavor.  It actually tastes like tap water.  The hint must refer to the smell because I surely dont taste anything.
5.0,2nd Harvest organic variety - tastes just like the regular organic matcha,Started drinking the DoMatcha organic variety around 2008. I thought the DoMatcha organic 2nd Harvest variety would be bitter or inferior/flat tasting since you get more for your money ounce for ounce.  Finally tried the 2nd Harvest variety a few months ago and I cannot tell the difference; it is just as smooth and flavorful as the more expensive (ounce for ounce) regular DoMatcha organic matcha.
1.0,not fresh and out of date,the price is good but the coffee is a crap shoot.Sometimes it is fine and sometimes it is out of date and the pods are swollen and brew at a slooooow pace. very frustrating and the coffee quality at that stage is poor. I never have time to return and I am not sure how to work Amazon or who is actually selling to me. The procust is poor quality about 50% of the time. I will not order anymore. Good luck. No place to get a reply or response so this is the only avenue I see.
5.0,A must-have,"This is a necessity for paella and even other Latina or southwest cooking. You cannot get the same taste from the regular Hungarian sweet or hot paprika. There is a backnote of smokiness that you cannot deny. As others have mentioned, this is a very multi-functional seasoning, you cannot go wrong; and with all three flavors (sweet, hot and bittersweet), you've got ALL your bases covered. I purchase this item many times not only for myself but for others who are always happy to receive it b/c it is not readily found in markets."
1.0,Catnip?,"The cats go nuts over regular catnip but they also eat it so I decided to give this a try. I shook it as directed before using it and it had no effect on them whatsoever. Maybe it's just the cats, but I won't be buying this again."
5.0,Scrumptious coffee,This is the best coffee.  We had been buying flavored creamers for the plain coffee but tried this and love it without any creamers.  It has a wonderful aroma and taste.
1.0,How the cookie crumbles,"We have been buying these almond biscuits for years from our local grocer and are pretty much addicted to them.  We were delighted to find them recently on Amazon for a better price and ordered a bunch.  Well, they arrived in a smashed cardboard carton with no inside protection, many of the biscuits were crumbled and the ones that survived were stale.  Fortunately we were able to obtain a refund from Amazon but will certainly not order them again.  Bummer! Back to our local grocer!"
1.0,Yuck!!,"The reason I decided to purchase this item is because of the other positive reviews.  But, after tasting it, I am not sure that the other reviews have ever tasted a real pancake!  These are yellow in color, have a gritty texture, and a eggy taste, sort of like French toast (and I HATE French toast). I am sure the rest of the box will sit on the shelves until it expires."
5.0,Textured Vegetable Protein,I have cooked with Textured Vegetable Protein for years and use it in my spaghetti sauce instead of ground meat. I've also used it in Chili with beans and soups. I can not tell the difference between it and ground beef as it absorbs the flavors from the sauce. I do not eat meat so this is a good source of protein for me.
1.0,Did Not Work!!!!,Product did not work as advertised.  Don't waste your money.  Plus drinking a 14.5 oz of bottle to try to get to sleep is not good.
5.0,these things are gooood,"the first time i had a big hunk candy bar was when my brother moved back east from colorado, he brough some back with him. i loved em chewy taffy with peanuts in it brilliant idea. try one you'll love em too :0)"
1.0,cadbury dairy milk fruit and nut chocolate,"Shipped from the U.K., these chocolates taste awful....sweet and very 'unchocolatey.' They are not the Cadbury fruit and nut chocolates I am used to. I checked the wrapper to look at the expiration date.....turns out they are manufactured in Russia! Not sure how Cadbury allows for this to happen....but they are clearly messing with their reputation. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,"Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other","I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product."
1.0,What a rip-off!  Don't buy it here!,I was willing to pay $4.99 per 10 stick pkg because I couldn't find this near my home and my dog loves them!  What a shock when I recently found it for $1.92 at the local Walmart!  What a rip-off!  Shame on you Amazon.com!
5.0,It's really good.,This is really good stuff. My mom puts it in our sausage gravy when we have sausage gravy biscuits. Don't read the ingredients ignorance is bliss.
5.0,A big hit for Christmas,"I sent this coffee sampler to my in-laws who are serious coffee connoisseurs, and they absolutely LOVED it! They said the taste of the coffee was very smooth and my father in-law said he didn't need to use any creamer nor sweetener when drinking the coffee. They have tried numerous types, brands, and styles of coffee and were very satisfied with this. It was wrapped according to them very lovely and made a wonderful Christmas gift. I would definitely recommend this and plan to try this for myself."
5.0,Red Mill TVP,Bob's Red Mill Textured Vegetable Protein is an excellent product and makes a great vegetarian substitute for ground beef.  I reconstitute it adding enough Kitchen Bouquet Seasoning Sauce which makes it look just like ground beef
5.0,ZEVIA REVIEW,I PLAN TO KICK SODAS.  THIS PRODUCT WILL LET ME GET AWAY FROM SUGAR AND ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS WHILE I SLOWLY CHANGE MY DIET HABITS.  TWIST ISN'T DIET 7UP BUT IT IS GOOD.
5.0,LOVE!,"I love this candy! Its sweet and creamy, almost like toffee when it gets soft. Def a favorite and all natural to boot! I like to use these on my kids when they have a sore throat. They don't like minty menthol candies, but like these and honey is a natural antiseptic, so it gives some healing and relief.  (I bought the eucalyptus as well for coughs, but I don't like it as much as these)."
5.0,Favorite at our house \Rated 5 stars,"Our Gaffney(border collie mix) is a very fussy girl.  Booda Bones with Bacon is her main choice.  After spoiling her with many treats, she has taught me Booda is one of her favorites."
5.0,A Shake A Day,"I am so glad Amazon carries this whey protein in a pack of 4. Spending $13 for one package at my local organic and health food store is quite pricey...sorry guys.  I use this practically everyday as a protein shake after a workout or simply as an in between meal snack. What I like most is that there are no additive flavors, just straight whey here with very little taste. So making your favorite smoothies is wonderful for those seeking higher protein in their diet. I usually use a 1/2 cup of frozen fruit(bananas, strawberries, or blueberries), a cup of milk, a tablespoon of grounded flax, some honey if desired and 2 tablespoons of whey. Sometimes I will use 1/2 cup of plain yogurt in which I will cut back to 1/2 cup of milk. Blend and you have yourself a highly nutritious food shake.  Highly recommend."
1.0,It was moldy!,"I ordered an 8 pack of this jerkey to try and stay range grown and healthy in my eating, but when I got it, it was a disaster!  First, I only got one of the 8 packs I was paying for.  I can't fault this  jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that.  However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!  I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now.  I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff."
5.0,Tasty,My grandson loves the strawberry Kellogg's Special K Bars but the strawberry flavored are sometimes difficult to find in the grocery store.  I was thrilled to find them on amazon and be able to buy them by the case on a regular basis.  Heaven forbid that Nana be caught without a strawberry breakfast bar at all times!
5.0,Delicious,"Nice packaging, great taste, and fair price. I would consider this again sometime for a gift. Its a shame they don't offer gift wrapping for this."
5.0,Great coffee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very nice taste, not as bold as I expected based on name, but very, very good. Very fresh roasted, placed in zip lock bag and sealed. Should stay good for awhile."
1.0,Gross,"I recently tried a dehydrated apple chip snack that I absolutely LOVED. After the market stopped selling those chips, I was looking for an alternative. I saw these and thought, why not? They are the same thing. NOT! These chips taste like vegetable oil. I was hoping for a chip like the last that I had, crunchy tangy and sweet. But these are deep fried which are not healthy. I threw the bag away. If you are looking for a potato chip that tastes like an apple, these are it. If you are looking for a healthy snack, look elsewhere."
1.0,BEWARE!,"Never received product. Contacted seller asking where my item was and never got a reply back. I had to file a complaint with Amazon to get it investigated and eventually, get my money back. I will never buy from this seller again."
1.0,Broccoli?,"I feel mislead by the name of this product as the ingredient list on the package lists pears first then peas and then broccoli. When I tasted it myself I realized why my daughter was enjoying it so much, it just tasted like sweet pears. If a product is going to claim to be healthy and organic it should know it's customers are not afraid to give their kids vegetables."
1.0,Meow.,"I have a cat named Charlie who loves this food. I have found that he looks healthier and his coat looks nicer when I feed him Iams then with other foods. He also seems to love this food and gets excited when I go in to the kitchen... that's his time to show off (I think) that he can eat. This comes in a 5 pack and Amazon shipped it right away, so no complaints there.  Edit:  March 20, 2011  I can not recommend this food anymore. Too many recalls and the ingredients are garbage. I am using Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul and my furry friend looks better, lost weight and is more active. To Iams... you have lost a customer due to your outsourcing and horrible product quality control."
1.0,Terrible price!,"Amazon has always been excellent for pricing.  However, I expected to get at least 2 bottles of sprinkles for $6.  I just got 1.  They are under $3 in the stores.  I won't be ordering sprinkles again from Amazon, needless to say."
1.0,An Unfortunate Misleading...,"I purchased two varieties, including this one. I've heard much praise for Das Foods' goods, but the caramels did not stand out in any way. The taste of fleur de sel was unnoticeable and the product indeed looks like the first and second photos given- there is no coarse salt on top of any of the caramels like the third pic. The second flavor I purchased showed me that they are not generous with their ingredients. It's a shame when disappointment in an item leads you to patronize someone else's business online... :("
1.0,AWFUL,"These may be good for you, but they taste absolutely terrible.  I'm a huge fan of healthy food that is good for you, but these taste HORRIBLE.  They taste very little like fruit and very much like sulfates and preservatives.  I would return them if I could, they aren't even palatable.  I tried to give them away for free and failed, the only way I might be able to choke these down would be in sugared oatmeal.  Not even space food, just definitely not food."
5.0,Best treat for catching contests....,"These are the best treats ever for tossing and catching. My basset hound is a great catch at home, but tended to drop cookies and things when at houndie events. These keep his attention and are just heavy and round enough to toss easily."
5.0,The Best,These dried mango treats make the tongue dance dance for joy. Also very good to accompany baked goods and mixed drinks  - A real Party Starter!
5.0,wonderful,"These taste wonderful. And they are at an amazing price, compared to what I can get them for at my local walmart."
5.0,Exactly as  advertised.,"The Equal tablets dispensers arrived a couple of days after ordering.  They are perfectly sized for pocket or purse and give an exact dose each time, unlike trying to pour out half a packet of the sweetner.  I'll re-order when my supply is nearly exhausted."
5.0,Very Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this stuff about two weeks ago and it was really really hot. I like the fresh taste in it. I put just a little on a cracker straight and had to drink a whole lot of water. I also made salsa with it and only used about 10 percent of the bottle and it is still very hot. Believe me when i say this is some good stuff. Hotter than the ghost pepper, and i have bought plenty of ghost pepper sauce."
1.0,Not gluten free,"Watch out -- this comes up on Amazon when you click through to the gluten-free section, but it contains wheat."
5.0,Cardamom?!  Amazing!,"Cardamom?!  Holy smokes!  So delicious, so different.  Try adding them to an affogato: vanilla ice cream, shot of espresso, cardamom bitters.  Mmmmm...  Of course, they're also great in whiskey cocktails.  Excellent quality, a better price for Scrappy's brand than I've seen in my local fancy-pants grocer, AND I've never seen Cardamom available anywhere else.  Just now discovered this product and love it!"
1.0,"Smells really, really, really bad.","I work in a rather fun office environment and I always get a little bit of a kick when I make this popcorn.  You see the smell is just horrible (think dirty feet).  But I love the expressions I get from my co-workers when I pop this in the microwave at work.  They immediately start complaining that they feel light headed and will then usually crack a door open to air the smell out.  Why do I keep eating this stuff?  Because my parents keep mailing it to me in gift baskets (I live overseas).  I don't have the heart to tell them this popcorn is disgusting.  I add Cheddar Cheese flavoring to this popcorn that comes in a little shaker, it makes the popcorn taste a little better."
5.0,Heathly Delightful Treats! You're gonna LOVE Them! A+ DELISH!,"I happen to like heathly snacks, so I ordered these thinking they would be similar to those garden Veggie Straws. They are just as heathly as the Straws(actually much MORE Heathly + Way Less Fat) but these are 1000% yummier!! If you could combine the heathliness of Veggie Straws with the delightful evil of Cheetos Puffs- you would get these!! If you like Cheetos Puffs texture- your gonna LOVE these- They have the same texture and salty cheesy flavor- But are totally heathly!! I am so Hooked on these Veggie Krinkle Sticks. I Cant get enough! My kids ages 11, 8 and 5 also LOVE em and beg me to put them in their lunches! A Must Buy Snack!"
1.0,Beware of food coloring,"I have bought these for less than half price at Marshalls, Home Goods, TJ Maxx. They get them in from time to time. Since reading about the dangers of artificial food colorings (This product obviously contains a lot), I now only purchase the plain un-colored kind.  Other than that, they taste pretty good.  I've never encountered the paper sticking to the candy & can't be removed."
1.0,Seller is a thief,I am using the salt and it is just fine but the seller was less than truthful. I bought a 2 pound bag and received a 4 ounce jar. Stay away from this thief of a seller. It would cost more to send it back than it cost in savings.
5.0,Kids love it,My six and eight year olds love this! They've been drinking it for years and never get tired of it.
5.0,Great tasting Earl Gray and Lavender Tea,"It's a lovely combination of earl gray/lavender tea, the menthol of the lavender is not overwhelming and the earl gray is the perfect combination, since earl gray denotes hints of bergmont which has citrus undertones. Please do not let the smell when you first open the bag deter you from brewing it. If it's a bit overwhelming in flavor cut it with some black tea. I personally love the lavender and do not want a weak insipid flavor, I wanted the full lavender experience."
5.0,My Favorite Tea,"As a  black tea aficianado, I have tried them all, esp. in my efforts to find a tea for all time or one that I will return to again and again.  As fate would have it,I  stumbled upon Taylors and Harrogate Yorkshire Gold Tea while browsing in an English import shop. I bought a bag and loved it from my very first cup.  Although it's not organic which would give it 6 stars in my evaluation, it's deep in flavor and smooth and has become my everyday tea.  As cabernet is to red wine, as dark French roast is to coffee, as 70% chocolate is to chocolate, Yorkshire Gold is to tea."
5.0,Not your typical honey mustard,"I am a BIG mustard fan!  I like to eat different flavors of mustard on different foods...from jalapeno to horseradish to dijon to...well, you see what I mean.  When I finally tried this brand of honey mustard, I was taken back AND delighted at the same time.  When I have chicken fingers, for example, I love to dip them in a honey mustard that is sweet and delicious.  THIS mustard is hot (just the right amount) and sweet and delicious!!  I like it better than regular honey mustard.  You should try it, but when you do, just know that you may never go back to regular honey mustard ever again...or even regular mustard mustard ever again!!  It is THAT good!!"
1.0,worst popcorn ever?,"This popcorn left an unpleasant-tasting layer of some waxy substance that built up in my mouth---on my teeth, lips, and tongue---as I ate. This was so nasty the person I was sharing it with simply stopped eating it. I hate wasting food, so I ate the rest even though I didn't enjoy it.  I'm really curious what ingredient might have been responsible for this phenomenon. Could it indeed be some kind of wax? Unfortunately I couldn't find this variety of popcorn on Newman's Own Web site. Perhaps it's been discontinued; I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
5.0,Good taste with energy boost,"At first, the seeds made this drink look unappetizing.  After the first couple of gulps, I got used to the consistency.  I drank one during work and surprisingly didn't feel as hungry as I usually do until after my workout 6 hours later.  So far, it beats out the caffeine drinks as an energy source without the crash."
1.0,"DIDN""T GROW!! PRODUCT NOT GOOD",I followed all of the directions on the package and the letter it came with. It has been three weeks and nothing has popped out. I really wanted this to grow for my cats but i guess it couldn't happen. When i opened the package some of the seeds were already out of the package. But okay shipping. Not a very good product...wouldn't recommend.
5.0,Love this product!,In my opinion the best tasting Vanilla extract I have found. Makes a vanilla pound cake taste great. Will buy again I would give it an A+.
5.0,Good Morning to me,"This cereal came as a shock to me, 12g of protein and it is gluten free AND it taste like cereal should. This could not have been a better find."
1.0,Yuck!,"I drink a lot of green tea, which I typically import from Japan.  I'm used to high quality green tea as I lived in Japan for two years.  I thought I'd give this tea a try. Simple:  Yuck...tastes like alfalfa.  For those who think this is quality green tea, they haven't haven't tasted good Netto Gyokuro tea.  There's no comparison. I guess, there's a reason this price is so low."
5.0,Simply the best,"I have been loyally making only this variety of brownie for several years but can no longer get the mix from local grocery stores, so I buy it here in bulk.  I always get compliments - I bring them to practically every function - and nobody can ever guess that they're low-fat.  The only down side is that it's easy to eat more because they're so delicious and you tend to justify that they're better for you!"
1.0,Sour Hormel product,"I opened one of these dishes for roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy and found it to be SOUR.  I want credit for the 6 unit carton. Can anyone help me?  Louise"
5.0,"Filets, not Paste","These anchovies were delicious, separated easily, and had none of the mushiness described in other reviews.  I will definitely buy them again."
5.0,Best Training Treats on the Market,"I am a Canine Behaviorist and last week I used these treat in my Basic Obedience Class.  They were a hit with all 8 dogs in my class.  The dogs would do anything for these treats.  These are what I call a ""high"" value treat.  The dogs can chew them quickly too and you can break them into really small pieces.  Love these!  Will be adding them to my list of recommended training treats."
1.0,Dreadful!,"I tried this tea out of curiosity yesterday... normally, I love Tazo teas.  But this one... ugh.  I couldn't drink more than a few sips before I felt the need to pour it out.  The scent of it alone reminded me of a funeral home.  It tastes and smells exactly like orange-scented wood polish.  Awful."
1.0,MOTH TRAPS STIR UP MOTHS BUT ONLY ONE TRAPPED,"We had few  moths hanging around on the walls, swatted them but each day another couple of moths again, no larva found. Bought the safer brand pantry pest trap.  When I opened the box the two traps had the lure pkts stuck in the traps; I had to pry them out of the sticky stuff and then open the lure packets.  Suddenly 5 moths swarmed around me.  I set the traps as instructed, saw one moth fly near the trap; one went in and came right out.  The others just swarmed near the trap but never went inside.  I had to kill them myself.  Then I took the other trap out of the pantry closet because it didn't catch any moths after three days.  I put that trap over the kitchen cabinet and immediately one moth showed up flew around and went in and did not come out.  Three days later no other moth went into the trap.  I haven't seen as many moths as before.  In the meantime I've checked cabinets, drawers, vacuumed and went over most of the kitchen.  No larva, just a couple of dead moths  in a pot cabinet.  For now I can't say the traps worked well."
1.0,WASTE of money,I bought this baby brezza four months ago. Used it almost every day. Was working fine until the steam and blend button just stopped working; a short time after that the blend feature... This item is just a BIG waste of money. Try to contact Baby Brezza? Well I don't think their answering machine is of any help..! Very disappointed..!
1.0,Shirl Girl,"My 86 year old Dad is on a low sodium diet, so I am always looking foods that are easy to prepare and tasty.  I give this chili two thumbs down.  Although this is very low in sodium, it is overpoweringly sweet and yet flavorless.  No amount of doctoring with spices helped. Don't waste your money on this one."
5.0,best milk chocolate ever,"A delectable treat from the manufacturer of Belgium's most popular brand of chocolates.  It has a creamy texture, and aromatic top and bottom notes; an excellent complement to coffee. A chocolate for the true connoisseur!"
1.0,way too expensive for a great product,The most ive seen at a grocery store is 5 bucks.....Trader Joes has it for 4 dollars. This is absurd....and just so you know....a loaf of Udi bread is about half the size of a conventional loaf....so its still more expensive than normal bread at 5 bucks. I can't find a good price on it on amazon.
1.0,decaf coffee have to.,"I am stuck with 36 of these K cups.San Francisco French Roast Decaf.  This french roast is expecially frenchy, very bitter!!!So what do I do with the other 34 cups?  One I gave to my daughter who loves french roast.  Does NOT want them.  Help!"
1.0,noway,"This was not good at all, so I will never buy this again. This does not tastes like Pears at all.My grand daughter did not like it. NOWAY!!"
5.0,Great quality...and American grown.,"This is a great product.  Full of flavor.  Worth the effort and extra cost.  I have seen the signs, ""Friends don't let friends eat foreign seafood.""  Well the same is probably true for rice."
5.0,Great decaff,"This is one of the best decaffeinated coffees out there, specially to make espressos. I had served this at home after dinners and nobody could tell that it is decaf, they love it."
5.0,"Very tasty, but difficult to separate out!","I have been eating these for years, and just love them for soup, especially a clear chicken broth type soup. The only drawback that I have found to them is that is virtually impossible to separate out the Palestinian from the Israeli content. I obviously assume that because they are made in Israel, there must be some Palestinian content, even if it is only the work involved in growing the wheat to make them. It would help if the manufacturer could help in making it easier for the consumer to separate out the Palestinian content in this product."
1.0,VERy unusual for Amazon... Big Price Rip Off,Hey first of all this is an excellent product.  Beats Crystal Light or Koolaid in taste and typically in price.  Problem is that Walgreens sells this exact item for $0.95 cents each (For a three pack... making 6 quarts).  This is over double the price.  I know this includes free shipping but who can not walk into a Walgreens and avoid the rip off.  I love Amazon but I guess even they can not be perfect.
5.0,Best puppy treat out there,"My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel will be 8 years old next month and I still give her these. I bought these when I first brought her home when she was 8 weeks old and began giving them to her for training purposes. On the advice of the woman running the puppy training class, I didn't give her the entire biscuit. I take each biscuit and break it by hand into 6 pieces. Each one is just bite size for a puppy. I still keep a jar of these by the door and give her a treat when she comes inside after ""doing her business"". Even after almost 8 years, she still loves them.  I do go through and break up about a jar's worth of biscuits at a time so I don't have to mess with it each time. It also has the advantage of reducing the amount of calories she is consuming since Cavaliers have a tendancy to put on too much weight. She feels like she is getting a treat without actually getting all that much.  The is the second dog I have done this with and these are the best treats out there for that purpose.  I, too, came to Amazon to look for these as my Walmart has discontinued carrying them/"
1.0,CAN'T WIN THEM ALLI,"I am an avid farm of Walden Farms products. Virtually calorie free, fat free and sugar free, many of the dressings, syrups and sauces are extremely palatable. The caramel dessert dip is quite satisfying; the chocolate version is not bad. But if you are looking for a peanut butter alternative, this peanut spread is a surprising catastrophe. We could take the thin & fluffy texture, but the taste seems truly unpleasant. Another reviewer mentioned a chemical taste; I agree. One wonders who the tasters were in the kitchen.  Walden Farms chefs---you can't win 'em all; take this product out of the line. It embarasses a truly innovative line of healthier products."
1.0,Buy This But Buy Somewhere Else,"This is a great tea - I've had it before and it was wonderful and complex - but the box I received from Amazon through their vendor must have been very old because the tea bags had hardly any flavor. I had to use more than one bag to make a decent cup of tea. And yes, the water was hot enough, and yes, I steeped it long enough. There was no expiration date on the box though there is a place for one. Even using two bags, it was practically flavorless. At more than a $1 a bag, that is ridiculous. Buy this delicious tea directly from Kusmi.com or if you are fortunate to have a Kusmi store in your area and leave these for the bin."
5.0,splenda,I use these splenda coffee sticks when I am out and about. They make the coffee taste soooooo good. They easily fit into your pocket.
5.0,Perfectly satisfied with these Apricots,"I just received my Apricots, the expiration date will be Jan. 2010, so I can be sure they won't turn black before this date... if they even last this long! I had read the previous reviews and was a little worried about the quality/ size/ freshness etc.  I bought 12 cans, as I will be using most of them for baking, sports bars, pastes etc. Therefore, only the freshness counts, not the size. The prize of $4.40 per 15 oz container is reasonable (price of total shipment divided among the supply), it's still more economical than buying in bulk on other sites, or at the Supermarket. Another reviewer commented about the lack of flavor. She might have had the sundried variety in mind, which is something different all together - and too pricey for my purposes. For casual snacking, etc. these Sunmaid Apricots are just fine..."
1.0,"Gives you smelly farts, worst apricot product ever had","This product can be summed up in one word, GARBAGE. This is not even worthy for compost, because it has been tainted with all sorts of chemicals, preservatives and ""natural flavors"", whatever the heck that means.  The ingredients list is as follows; Dried apricots (from Turkey) Natural Flavors Medium Chain Triglycerides Sulfur Dioxide = Uncontrollable smelly farts Sodium Bisulfite = Uncontrollable smelly farts Potassium Sorbate.  This is a good product if you're going to shoot a prank video that involves you having to fart really loud and smelly in someones face or something, but other than that I can't think of why you would want to buy this product, in my opinion it is complete waste of money. On the package it is advertised as ""premium"" and ""intense flavor and aroma"". Allow me to clarify, if by premium they mean premium tainted apricots then that is spot on, and by intense flavor and aroma what they mean is the smell of sulfur coming off these apricots is so intense you'll be farting every minute for the next 3 hours.  Shame on Mariani for wasting so many apricots. Worst apricots ever. I would Strongly NOT recommend this product, buy organic apricots instead."
5.0,Spacon - it's as good as Bacon,"My family LOVES Spam, and of all it's variations (Spicy, Garlic, Cheesy, Plain, etc) - Hickory Smoke is by FAR the best. If you're not sold on the idea of Spam, try this Spacon recipe:  Start with some Hickory Smoke Spam and slice it thin - about the width of an individual sugar packet. Cut those slices lengthwise, so you have long, thin strips like bacon. Pour a little olive oil in a cast iron skillet and get it nice and hot. Fry your Spam slices until they're nice and crispy on both sides, then remove to a paper towel. Serve with eggs, hashbrowns, or whatever your favorite breakfast foods are. It tastes like bacon, but more crispy and less fatty (and much lower in calories).  It also makes great sandwiches: Slice thicker, about 1/4 inch, lightly fry it with some Pam/non-stick spray and set it on Rye bread with lettuce, tomato, and Smoked Paprika Mayo (just mayo mixed with smoked paprika). Delicious!!!  Also, if you're a fan of smokers and BBQ, try sticking a block of Spam in the smoker with your brisket, pork butt, and ribs. It's unlike anything you've ever tasted.  Really - if you love pork, there's absolutely no reason NOT to love Hickory Smoke Spam."
5.0,Erin BAker's Ultra Protein Granola Power Crunch,"This product is wonderful. Very tasty! Good price. Hard to find anywhere in the stores and when I did, it was almost $2 more a bag, than I paid on Amazon.com."
5.0,BEST CATNIP TOYS EVER!!,"These are the BEST CATNIP TOYS EVER! I even discovered (by accident) that they can be washed! My sister was told, at the store where she usually purchases them, that they are being discontinued. My cats are devastated. They last a very long time, have a rich catnip smell, and cats do choose their own favorites!"
5.0,Top-notch dog food...,"I have been researching dog food for our puppy for awhile.  The goal was to find something that was 1.) optimal for her health, most importantly and 2.) not so hard on our wallets.  After trying a few other foods, this one beat out the rest.  She loves it, it is made with top-quality ingredients, and we get a reasonable deal through Amazon with free shipping if you sign-up for a delivery schedule.  This was also the only place we found that sells bags larger than 5 Ibs.  BEST of all... no more horrible puppy gas!  She is part Boston Terrier, which can be known for flatuence... this food has completely done away with this problem.  You can check any dog food review site, Castor & Pollux gets top reviews.  Very pleased.  We will be sticking with this brand for quite some time to come!"
1.0,Not impressed at ALL,"This product was not HORRIBLE, but I feel cheated. It looked so good, and the price of $4.99 for a small jar suggested there were some great add-ins. NOT.  The berry nut flavor is basically average-tasting crunchy peanut butter with some tough, dried cranberries thrown in. I was hoping the ""nut"" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut. After I got done picking the hard cranberries out of my teeth, I decided I would never by this flavor of overpriced, disappointing peanut-butter again."
1.0,They have no clue,"The chocolates arrived ruined.  It is clear that they were stored hot and somewhat melted, were then placed on ice and frozen and shipped in ice packs.  The result:  A wonderful chocolate ruined since the smooth filling remained hard on thawing....these turned into bad Hersheys with this handling.  The company should give up on providing the product, since they ruin it with their handling.  (PS...one box was crushed)."
1.0,Kitty's review,I too am looking for McCormick butter salt. Butter buds is a poor and powdery substitute.  Will go back to butter and salt first.  Watkins is decent but nothing beats McCormick's which they got when they bought out Durkee. Hope this helps bring them back around!!
1.0,gelatin in the ingredients..why?,I am vegitarian and apparently its egg-free but decided to add gelatin...how hard is it to make simple cookie/cracker without adding the animal crap to it?
5.0,Extra good!,"If you like it bold, this is the coffee for you!  I highly recommend this product because it tastes really good without that added ""chemically"" taste that some manufacturers put into their ""bold"" coffee mixes to make it taste stronger.  This is the real deal.  In fact, all of Coffee People's kcups are great."
1.0,GRAB BAG - NOT a SAMPLER!!!,"I am VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! SIX English Breakfast Teas, 5 Nicaraguan Fair Trade, 4 French Roasts & 3 Island Coconuts and various multiples and singles but NO Jet Fuel, NO Lake & Lodge, NO Nanatucket Blend, NO Southern Pecan, NO Breakfast in Bed, NO  Hawaiian Hazelnut, NO Rodeo Drive, NO Sorrento Vienna Coffee House; NO India Spice Chai Tea; NO African Rooibos Tea!!!!!  I got this in order to try these varieties!!! There is a variety of unknowns - but really dislike the multiple multiples! Was planning to order other samplers -- but now -- FORGET IT!!!  By the way - Thirty one dollars for 35 pods -- mostly tea -- is NOT all that great a price!!!"
1.0,Dry and tasteless,"I bought this when I could not find the Manishevitz brand (which I think is the tastiest). I made it as per package directions-it fried well and stayed together, but it was dry and tasteless in a pita, even with hoummous on top. Beach sand is the closest description used in these reviews and that is how I would describe the taste and texture."
1.0,Inauthentic,"I was disappointed when I bought these beans at the Harry Potter Expo.  The flavors have nothing to do with Harry Potter.  I don't mind extras, but the manufacturer should include all of the flavors written in the book.  A devoted Harry Potter fan will be looking for: chocolate, peppermint, spinach, liver, tripe, bogie/booger, pepper, vomit, toffee and earwax.  Previously, I enjoyed the beans including these authentic flavors, as well as other interesting ones that fit the theme such as grass and dirt.  Where did they go?  This set includes only one flavor from the book (pepper) and the rest seem completely out of touch with the theme.  While others may find these fun, I find no point in buying something as a fan when the item has nothing to do with the thing that I love.  I hope they bring the real beans back!"
1.0,If you like licorice you will hate this.,Flavorless black jujubee- all filler no flavor. Barely discernible licorice taste in a starchy semi-hard gel that doesn't really chew - After the first bite the candy tube collapses and it just fragments into smaller gel bits. It's like they made the candy for someone who doesn't like the taste of licorice- and I bought five lbs. of this waste.  Stupid me. Hope you licorice lovers don't get burnt. Good luck.
1.0,Inedible and hard as a rock...literally!,"I would normally give anyone (the seller in this case, not the maker) the benefit of the doubt on products, but these were awful!  They had to have been several years old at least!  The caramels were hard as a rock and inedible.  Unfortunately, I had already given a bag (they came pre-bagged) as a gift before I tried them.  I immediately called and apologized to the recipient after tasting.  The remaining four bags I unwrapped and fed to the wildlife.  They didn't even melt out in the rain if that gives you any idea how stale they were.  I definitely will NEVER buy from this dealer again.  They had to know how old they were before mailing.  And these candies were a favorite before this purchase. (Goetze Caramel Creams - 1 lb. divided into 5 bags)  I had to select a ""star"" for the rating since there isn't a catagory for being disatisfied."
1.0,really tastes bad,"Tastes really bad.  A strong Chemical after taste. zero grams sugar, but still products tastes sweet -- loaded with chemicals and artifical sweetners one bite and it fills your stomach.  A bloaty feeling just after a couple of bites. a definete NO-NO for any one 12 and younger.  But also not recommended averse to eating food with unnaturnal ingrediants.  Since Amazon does not accept return of grocery items - I had to trash the product."
5.0,Delicious!,"A friend got me hooked on this coffee and now I use it at home in my espresso maker.  I love the flavor with or without sugar, but my fave is adding Sugar In The Raw to it, YUM! The grind is perfect; it makes a great cup of espresso/latte/cappuccino...whatever your taste desires."
1.0,Try Coleslaw and French Dressings Instead!,I tried each salad dressings of walden farms and bleu cheese is one of the most unsavory ones that also ruins the taste of the salad. It tastes and smells like white glue. So I would suggest Coleslaw dressing which is great and can also be used for Caesar salad. French also tastes good for giving a spicy taste to the salad.
1.0,Cheap Bubblegum is not a Fruit Punch,"When I want a pre-workout drink, it should give me energy and attempt to taste good. I bought two containers of this in Fruit Punch because that's hard to screw up. Not only didn't I get any pep in my step, but it tastes like awful bland bubblegum.  Sorry, just didn't do it for me. I stepped it up and got one from the guys who make theAnimal Pak products. Tastes great and I get pumped."
5.0,Honey of a Deal! :),"I used these small jars of Honey as a promotional item/marketing tool as September was National Honey Month.  Gave out little boxes that had different types of teabags in them, along with 3 disposable coffee cups, spoons and the little jars of honey.  It was a big hit & everyone commented how delicious the honey was!  I recommend this product highly@"
1.0,My cat just doesn't like it,"I don't know what it is about this cat food, but I can't get my cat to eat it.  Every pellet is the same color and probably the same flavor.  I've had a bag of this food for over 2 months and she will only eat canned food when I offer this food."
5.0,Dove Soap,Dove is my favorite soap. The price was outstanding and made this an extremely good purchase.
5.0,Great tasting tea,I discovered this tea at a bed and breakfast.  Been drinking it ever since. Love it. Can't find it where I live so Amazon fills my needs.
1.0,raw almonds,I mistakeningly ordered raw almonds.  I can roast them and they will be fine. Had a digesting them.  Love the raw taste but just don't have good luck with them.
1.0,Made in China!!!,Bought a small SmartBones chicken dog chew for our mini dachshund this afternoon from the pet store and just discovered that this product is made in China!!  NO THANKS!
5.0,Delicious,"This product is delicious!  I use it in soups, stews, and even fajitas!  I use it for all my chicken and vegetable  dishes!  I do not miss the MSG at all  Try it  you won't be disappointed!"
5.0,Heinz Baked Beans,"I was delighted to find these Heinz Baked Beans available on Subscribe & Save.  Having moved to the US in the last two years, I was surprised to find that Heinz Baked Beans were not readily available for purchase in supermarkets without being mixed with frankfurters (yech).  The nearest equivalent was the Heinz vegetarian beans, but the taste was not the same.  Moreover, the price in the supermarket is ridiculous.  The price on Subscribe & Save is a little high, but at least I can get the product I want"
5.0,Delicious,I just bought these today and since I've almost eaten the whole bag I had to find 'em cheaper than they were at my grocery store.
1.0,Just Terrible.,"We have a gluten free household of 5.  No one in our family likes these.  My children (9, 7, &5) are begging me to throw the box away - I think they are afraid I'll sneak one in their lunchbox.  The cookie crumbles leaving a dry mess of rice flour and hardish chewy fruity bits in your mouth.  Have a glass of water nearby if you try these.  I hate to leave a bad review, but there are way better gluten free options out there.  (I won't throw the box away.  I'll pass it on to another gluten free family I know and let them form their own opinion.)"
1.0,Didn't work for me,"I bought these traps and had no luck whatsoever. I had loads of moths and I had used another brand, which worked very well, but that brand was no longer available. Then I bought this brand and it didn't catch one moth. I used one trap with one square of pheromone. I followed the directions completely. In other words, I don't think the problem was me. I have to wonder whether these sat on the store shelf too long. Anyway I took them back to the store and got my money back.  It might be hard to return these if they catch one of a hundred moths and are therefore used and slightly successful. Fortunately for me they did nothing.  I now have another infestation and need to do something about it, but I don't know what I'll do as I need a product that is 100% successful, else the remaining moths will replicate."
5.0,Tasty little chips,I tried a lot of Garden Eatin's chips.  These are also very good if you like little chips instead of big triangular size ones.  Great when having Mexican food.
5.0,Make it Sugar Free with Splenda,I like the sugar free kool-aids but they have Nutrasweet which I cannot have. I use the regular packs like these which are very well priced and add Splenda instead of sugar and it tastes wonderful.  I don't drink soda's so this makes it easier to get some of my daily water.
1.0,Ridiculous Price!,"This is ridiculous! You are not SAVING $15.00, you are spending at least $5.00 MORE than you should be! The highest price for a 9oz. individual can in my area is $4.49 (I know, yikes!), so 27oz. would cost me around $14.00...why would I want to spend MORE MONEY?!? Thanks for wasting time- I'm obviously not going to find any savings from this company."
1.0,Wrong product sent,"I did not get the item pictured.  I ordered the Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce with the green and yellow label.  I received Golden Mountain Sauce with a yellow and red label.  I don't think it is the same thing.  Both products are sold on the site, so I am not sure what happened."
1.0,love it to death,"It was a beauty when I received it but slowly but surely it started to lose all its leaves and eventually died. I'm good with these plants but to no avail. It looks great in the picture with the little pond and all but whether you keep this plant indoors at any temperature, it is doomed. Amazon is very nice when it comes to these plants. They usually are very nice when a plant passes away by crediting your credit card but it took so long to die that I just couldn't call them to ask for a credit because of the long period of time between the time I bought it and the time it died. Oh well, I'll write it off on my taxes or something like that."
1.0,Surprised that my cats don't like these,"When I buy a 5 star item from Amazon, it is always a good product. In this case, the product may be just fine quality wise, but for some reason my cats hate these flakes. Of the two cats, when presented with the flakes - one gave me a ""are you stupid"" look and the other one gave me a ""why did you do this to me"" look. Both of the cats like all other cat treats and are not picky eaters. Don't know why they don't like these, both of them go nuts for seafood. Given that all the other reviews are very positive, perhaps I got a bad batch of flakes and it is just an aberration, but both cats are very much ""Do Not Want!"" on these flakes."
5.0,Delish!,The only thing that would make this perfect snack a little more perfect? More organge zest!!! Otherwise just love this.
1.0,"Maruchan Yakisoba, Teriyaki Beef Flavor, 4-Ounce Microwavable Containers (Pack of 8)","I ordered these, thinking (hoping) that they would taste similar to the same item manufactured by ""Nissan"". They arrived timely and packaged well without any complaints, however the taste is nothing at all compared to the quality of the Nissan brand of teriyaki noodles. I loved the four cheese flavor in this brand, but the teriyaki beef is really awful (in my opinion).  I would definitely opt for Nissan brand in this flavor next time. Not even my teenage son likes them in this brand."
1.0,the worst,If I could give zero starts I would. This is the worst tasting stevia I have ever tried. Incredibly bitter. Plus it has dextrose and the bag of stevia in the raw has maltodextrine. Not to mention raw ground stevia would actually be GREEN and not white. I will not buy this product or reccomend it. I only bought it like another reviewer because it was at walmart while I was waiting for my orders of nustevia and the kal brand of stevia to come in. The nustevia is very good and I am still waiting on the kal brand because I've heard it is amazing.
1.0,Dont waste your money,Dont waste your money on on this. Use rock wool instead. I called the company asking what kinds foam is in their kits and they wouldn't tell me they described it as bio degradable special foam - so I called a couple of foam companies asking questions and experimented a bit. What worked best for me and is drastically cheaper is rock wool instead.
1.0,Not for these cats,"First reaction was good, but these two cats let me know they were not going to eat it. I thought they would eat most anything, but it seems this is not for them."
5.0,Chocoholic's Heaven,"We were EXTREMELY pleased to receive our first order of the 10 pound package of Ghiradelli Chocolate Sweet Ground Chocolate and Beverage Mix from Amazon, and have already ordered our second.  We use Ghiradelli's every single day, in our coffee in the morning and on our frozen yogurt in the evening.  We've loved it for years but to find the 10 pound package makes us love it even more--never have to worry about running out too soon.  We decant it into 16 ounce containers and store the remainder in the refrigerator until needed.  Hope Amazon continues to carry this produce because we'll definitely continue to purchase it."
5.0,"Wonderful, Smooth Flavor!!","I ordered this product based on a sample a friend of mine sent me from Hawaii.  It arrived as scheduled and was as fresh as the sample I had tried.  Kona Coffee is certainly smooth with a nutty, almost chocolaty taste compared with other coffees I have tried.  I wonderful product that I will continue to order!"
5.0,Great value for quality cat food,"After researching pet food ratings, quality, and ingredients; we have settled on this cat food for our two adult cats.  The food has great ratings for quality ingredients and is reasonably priced in comparison to many of the higher end pet foods.  My cats have been eating this for several years now and still seem to enjoy it.  Their coats are soft and shiny and the amount of food they eat is less with the quality food."
1.0,Barely Miso,Not a good product. Soup box covers were partially off. Taste is barely like miso. Get 1 box somehow to taste before you order the 12 box. We Still have 10 of 12 boxes sitting around and probably never be used.
1.0,quality needs to improve,"Old, stale, dried up beans. Beans smell bad. Coffee tastes bad. Doesn't cure coffee withdrawal headaches. Quality needs to improve."
1.0,Horrible,This was the worst purchase ive ever made on Amazon . It does not work at all- I mean NOT at all. I used another brand the next day and it worked beautifully!!
1.0,Reduced to 99.9 cents per cup,"hopsandmalt, they took your comments to heart and reduced the price to 99.9 cents a cup. Glad to see we buyers are heard. These prices for k-cups are so ridiculous. I would think Starbucks would at least be competitive with other brands."
5.0,My Dogs LOVE Greenies!,My three dogs love Greenies.  So much so that they know the exact time every evening they are supposed to get them! They act like kids in a candy store!
5.0,For weight loss and blood sugar control,"I was diagnosed with type 2 six months back. Decided to lose weight and cut carbs (no sugar, potato, pasta, rice or bread 95% of the time, sometimes I cheat :) ) in order to get in control. Been using extend bars since. I have one for breakfast with coffee. Then for lunch I have another one, sometimes I have a salad instead, or with. The key is that they really seem to work well to suppress my appetite, probably because they stabilize my blood sugar. Anyway after six months I'm down 25 Ibs without really starving and my blood sugar level have improved significantly, my doctor was very happy and told me I will not need any Meds if I keep this up. I plan to lose another 25 with the help of the extend bars. So I recommend these. Just note that some bars have more sugar. I only use the ones without. Note that I also do a bunch of other stuff nutritionally to lose weight and control blood sugar so this is one piece of the puzzle, but a big one. One thing I have NOT done is exercise. Not one bit. Not proud of it but happy that I can lose weight and improve blood sugar levels anyway. No doubt I would do even better with exercise."
5.0,Chicken Noodle Soup with LOTS of Noodles,"There was a time when we would buy chicken ramen because it was inexpensive.  The flavor is very good and the soup has a lot of noodles compared to canned chicken noodle soup.  This soup is reasonably easy to prepare, and begs to have a few extra vegetables thrown in.  The soup is so simple that even an elementary school child should be able to prepare it.  While the soup is relatively low calorie (190 calories), as with many soups it does have a fair amount of salt, with 850 mg of sodium.  If you eat few other foods with much salt, this soup could be a perfect balance.  Maruchan Chicken Ramen has been and continues to be a family favorite.  The large quantity of noodles and tasty broth make it perfect for a lunch or dinner meal, especially when you are looking for something a little different."
1.0,Nothing like the original Arizona Half & Half,Since they went to the new look they also went to a new taste. Lite or Calorie free.. both taste like absolute crap!  I loved the original hate the new!  Arnold Palmer means CRAP TASTE!
1.0,Bellino Torrone (Hard Nougat) with Almonds,The Bellino Torrone (Hard Nougat) with Almonds are hard and has no taste. I thought if I did not care for them I would give them to friends but these are so bad that I threw them away. This product taste like you are eating a brick.
5.0,Brilliant Taste!,"Seriously, you can NOT go wrong with Cadbury products! This flaky goodness is rich in flavour and it melts in your mouth. Puts Hersheys to shame!"
5.0,Wonderful!,"Both the chocolate and lemon zest madeleines are soft, fresh, and very delicious.  A real treat.  I highly recommend them and would buy again."
1.0,beware..this brand the most recalled,I ordered this for my son's dog..so he wouldn't need to buy it for awhile. A week after it arrived I learned that this brand had been involved in a major recall for food poisoning and even people handling the food (and some just petting dogs that ate it) were made very ill and the potential for fatalities was alarming. I tried to get specifics from vendor and brand but got nada..I ended up looking it up and found thevey been involved and 4 or 5 serious recalls since 2003.
1.0,BLECHT,It's like eating whey Grass with carbonation.  NOT RECOMMENDED! I couldn't get through more than 2 sips. GROSS!
5.0,Pure Pleasure - Memories of over 60 yrs .... of,"helping my Grandfather tend to the bee hives that he maintained for the Apple/Peach and Pear Orchards on the Mohawk Trail in Western Mass.  the taste is excellent - the packaging very good - the spout top better than the 'Honey Bear' head to pour from as well as wipe clean.  off to try on some McCann's Irish Oatmeal -  McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick & Easy, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)   4 min in deep bowl in Microwave - Berries in bottom if desired - or even canned drained fruits/ Peaches - Pears  Topping with Honey and Whip Cream a perfect comfort food on a nasty winter day. Even as bedtime snack - as will not upset stomach"
5.0,Drachmeler,"Miracle grow continues to please no matter where and when you use it. I am a happy user now for more than 8 years. Easy to use, very effective at recommended doses and works for all kinds of plants inside and out."
1.0,EVERYONE runs away from these!,"These Robbie Dawg snacks have been rejected to the extreme degree by every animal!  I bought them originally for a cat whose who loves Temptations snacks. Not only did she not touch these, but when one of these was in her Temptations snack dish, she wouldn't even go near the bowl, as if this snack contaminated all in its vicinity.  I next tried it on an outdoors cat who lives in the neighborhood. Since he lives the life of a homeless scavenger, one wouldn't expect him to be picky. Yet not even real hunger would make the bridge for him trying this.  All right, how about dogs then? While this was made for cats, my experience is that many dogs will bascially eat anything you hand them (gulp it down first, and ask questions later). Outcome....  My neighbor's dog answer: No way. Next two dogs, same answer. One of those dogs I've known for over a decade and this is the very first time she has ever refused anything I've offered her. We left one of these treats on the dining room floor for the evening, and it statyed there all night, until we resigned and threw it in the trash.  Also tried it on a pair of rats. These two rats eat brown rice as part of their daily diet and one of them in particular has a liking for fish. Since those are two of the -alleged- ingredients in the product, I should have been hopeful for this match. But no, same answer from these two as everyone else.  Last, tossed some into the backyard, just in case any of the many birds out there might be hungry enough to give it a go. Well? I bet you can guess the outcome.  All that is left to check, I think, is whether even the ants outdoors give the same answer....  It is a major mystery what is going on here. One thing in my mind is that whatever is stated as the ingredients on the package does not correspond to what is in the product I received. That something went badly wrong at the plant, and it would be for lab analysis to actually determine what these little brown block things are actually composed of.  All I know for now is that there is a universal verdict from every animal in the jury: it is absolutely inedible."
1.0,ridiculous pricing scheme,"1 cent for the root beer, and $47 for shipping.  Why does Amazon even let this on here?  It simply takes up space when I search for root beer."
5.0,Yummy,These tasted fresh and fruity my son and i ate the whole bag in 3 days it's addictive please be warned these are delicious :)
1.0,Trouble using it,"There are no instructions as to how to prepare the bottle for use. It seemed straight forward but apparently I opened the hole too wide and instead of ""drops"" it poured out in a stream. It didn't go over well with my cat. It made a huge mess. Yes, maybe I bungled it, but how about some explicit instructions if it's so easily botched? I'm throwing the rest away. She'll never trust the sight of that bottle again."
5.0,hard to find,"This is the ONLY baking powder as far as I am concerned, and it is not available locally.  So I was very pleased to find it on Amazon.  I bought six cans! and threw away the can of inferior baking powder."
5.0,Coffee-Mate Italian Sweet Creme,I've found that the Italian Sweet Creme is my favorite of all the Coffee-Mate flavors with one reserve.  The hesitance comes with the high too-sweet power of the cream.  The counter act is to mix the Italian Sweet Creme 50/50 with Coffee-Mate's Original Creme.  Then it's not too sweet and you can enjoy the taste of the coffee as well as the Italian Sweet Creme.
5.0,great flavor,Just as the name says. It's a hint of french toast with maple syrup.A great morning coffee with a wonderful aroma that fills the room.
1.0,Bad  Product,"The door on the litter box gets stuck inside the box, trapping your cat inside.  Avoid this product."
5.0,Definitely not the same old sauce,"This is not the same old tomato based hot sauce. It is an imaginative take on a spice sauce that works well on just about anything from hamburgers and barbecue to beans and rice. It's not available at the grocer where I live - but it's coming soon! So, I have to order it online. The vendor was great. The product was shipped when promised and arrived in an earth-friendly package.  Bottom line: I love this sauce and use it all the time."
5.0,Excellent quality at a reasonable price,Chickpea bean is an excellent source for many minerals and proteins. I purchased two packs of them in order to get free shipping. The beans are carefully selected with fresh smell. I use them mostly for making the soup by the automatic soymilk maker. You will get smoother soup if the beans are presoaked in water for 8 to 10 hours just as you would do with the soybeans. I would recommend this product for everyone that wants to try the dairy replacement for proteins and calcium needs.
5.0,Delicious!,These come in a large plastic bag which is double bagged. There is minimal olive oil brine and the tasty small to medium sized brown and black olives are pitted. If you are a fan of Kalamata olives you will be in heaven. They are so good I even started eating them as a snack by themselves. I'll just have to go w/o salt the rest of the week.Yum!
1.0,Not Mayo at all !!!,I like Walden Farms dressings so I was so excited to taste this mayo. Oh My God!!!!!!!!! What's this!? I am soooooooooo disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!! The texture is like mushed tofu and the taste is not mayo at all. Just salty and weird.
1.0,Cadbury Shortcake for review,"I have always loved Cadbury - the chocolate is so rich and creamy. I was trying to recapture my youth - my mother and I used to buy these all the time and they were wonderful, but that was about 20 to 30 years ago.  I am not sure if they changed the recipe, but these were not what I remember - the chocolate was good, but the shortcake was stale and not the same flavor or texture.  I will not order these again.  The only positive is that I received the product right on schedule."
1.0,Check the EXPIRATION DATE!!,"I have ordered many perishable items from Amazon over the years and have usually had no problems.  I received crackers yesterday and went to open them today.  Happened to glance at the bottom and crackers had expired on OCTOBER 6, 2011.  Three MONTHS ago!  This is totally not cool."
5.0,Hot Chocolate that is MMMMMMMM yummy,"I've used all of the hot chocolate in these cans and enjoyed every ounce of it, it's sooooooo good. I even have used it with coffee to enhance the flavor and it made the coffee 100% better."
1.0,No good,"My dog figured this out in 20 secs and quickly lost interest right after. Just spinnning a little opens up ALL the food compartments. Also, its hard to get at some of the food given how narrow the opening is. Would not recommend."
1.0,ewww,Nasty! I would rather eat cardboard. 20 people at work tried it and none could even swallow the first bite. The only reason it has one star is because amazon would not let me continue with zero stars. :(
5.0,perfect flavors,I recently purchased this item for a quick breakfast food when I am running late.  The flavors are our favorite and the price for the box is the best I have found at any of our grocery stores or anywhere else online.
1.0,Bad Odor,In February of 2010 I ordered a 14 oz canister of Pro-Treat Freeze dried chicken liver dog treats.I had been giving another brand of freeze dried chicken liver treats to both my dog and cat. They both loved these treats. When I opened my new Pro-Treats freeze dried liver treats I smelled an odd odor. My cat would not eat these new treats. My dog did eat these treats  but every morning he started throwing up. I stopped giving these treats to my dog and he stopped getting sick. The liver treats may or may not have been responsible for my dog getting sick but I didn't want to take a chance of my dog getting sink again.
5.0,Dog will do anything for these cookies!,"My beagle-daschund Pixel isn't picky about treats, but it's clear that the Lazy Dog Cookie Co. Carob Chip Pup-squeaks are her favorite!  These treats are great because they're made from high-quality ingredients in the USA, they're vegan, and they're free of corn, soy, wheat, and all of the common allergens found in many dog treats. These treats smell wonderful: like little pumpkin cookies. These are great for smaller dogs because they're not too hard (you can easily break them in half), and they're just the right size (breaking it in half gives your doggie two little bites).  I keep these treats on top of Pixel's crate, and she gets one at bedtime or when she has to go into her crate during the day. She loves them so much that if I tell her ""time for bed,"" she runs to her crate and sits inside, looking up at the top of the crate because she knows that these treats are there and she's going to get one.  Best dog treat I've found so far! I hope Amazon gets these back in stock soon. The 6-pack deal that I bought was by far the best deal I've seen on these treats."
5.0,World's Finest Earl Grey,"Williamson, previously Williamson & Magor, make a rich, well blended Earl Grey with a deep delicate spicy flavor that is without equal.  I used to think that Harrod's No. 42 Earl Grey was the best I had tasted.  It is, however, unavailable in the US, and must be purchased in Britain.  Some Internet research uncovered that it is blended for Harrod's by Williamson, so I tracked down their Earl Grey which was then avaliable on two US websites.  It is even better than Harrod's.  Harrod's Earl Grey, by the way, is best purchased as you leave the UK.  There is a Harrod's store in the international departure area at Heathrow - they do not charge the 18% VAT.  Willaimson reorganized last year and their tea was supposedly unavailable in the US, so its appearance on Amazon - and with Amazon Prime elegibility - is more than welcome.  This is the finest. Another fact: Williamson is reputed to blend the tea for the Royal Family in Britain. Some added thoughts: I did a little research on the Williamson website.  They now grow their tea on their own farms in the hioghlands of Kenya.  Undoubtedly the superior flavor of the tea comes from the quality of the base tea.  They mention picking only the bud and first two leaves.  That cannot be beat.  Some teas are the first three; Argentine tea (known for being some ofthe world's worst) is ""harvested"" with a machine that looks like a hedge trimmer.  Any leaves past the first three have no tea flavor.  So excellent harvesting is a laborious hand process."
1.0,very disappointing,I'm the account holders wife....I bought this based on the good reviews.  I was disappointed. I made a batch of it and it was so bad I wouldn't even feed it to the livestock and they usually get all our scraps. The consistancy of the noodles was horrible and I followed the instructions and I even rinsed it.  I have made lots of spaghetti over the years and this one was the worst.  I'm going back to rice flour spaghetti.
5.0,Pamela's Baking Mix,This baking mix is great for people suffering from gluten intolerance!  Lifesaver for breakfast recipes! Highly recommended and Amazon has the best prices!
5.0,great healthy spice- perfect for everything and with no salt,"This Vegie pepper is perfect for soups, steaks, lamb, salads and almost everything - and so healthyy as it contains no salt."
5.0,Delicious and perfect for dinner parties,"Delicious and beautiful cookie platters! Love the bakery and so happy they decided to offer online ordering. Love this cookie tray to bring to dinner parties or any special occasion. If you live in the area, you HAVE to try their cakes. I had one at my baby shower and EVERYone commented on how amazing it was."
1.0,Just Weird,"The little ""tree"" certainly looked healthy; yet the ""trunk"" was really weird - a bulbous ""v"" shape coming up to a top that had no branches, just a puff of stems with leaves.  Had it not had a confined root system in a small pot with a wire it had grown around, I would have sworn someone had just chopped off a bush, let it sprout back and then dug up the plant and called it a bonsai.  I took it to work to make sure it wasn't just me.  Everyone agreed it was weird and ugly."
1.0,Sorry to disappoint,"I expected a lot from this coffee.  I've always appreciated Emeril's recipes, and felt that they had something extra with his ever present ""BAM!"" kick.  However, after my excitement while tearing open the box, I felt like the ""BAM!"" was the blow of disappointment as I smelled the coffee brewing.  To my dismay, the taste of the coffee was totally bland, and not really distinct in any way.  This box turned me off to buying any of Emeril's coffee products.  I'll stick with my utterly perfect, always there for me Dark Magic, thank you very much.  Don't worry Emeril, I'll still be buying the next edition of your cookbook.  I'll just skip over any of the liquid sections."
5.0,Good chocolate chips,These shipped with ice packs - a good idea in the middle of summer.  Reasonable price for a product I can trust as safe for these allergies.  I like the mini-chips... makes me think I get more chocolate in each cookie.
1.0,would be okay if they didnt get hard after 5 minutes,"I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether. Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard."
1.0,Baffling,"For a health product, why does this contain high fructose corn syrup ? The additive provides no value to a person and according to current research may actually be harmful. Benecol should offer it sugar free. If Coke & Pepsi can offer sugar free products, why can't Benecol ?"
1.0,Not So Black,I looked everwhere to change my daughter's birthday cake frosting black when the frosting was white.  This product sprays on and says it will give it a black color.  I followed the instructions perfectly and it gave it a grayish color only if you sprayed a bunch on.  The smell was awful and it looked awful.  Realizing it wasn't going to work I stopped and tried to scrape it off.  The entire cake absorbed the flavor - it was horrible and the cake ended up in the garbage.
1.0,"Disappointing, little selection, coffee wasn't great","I was disappointed with the selection here - ""24 count"" sampler made me think I'd be getting 24 flavors to try.  Instead it was only around 9 or 10, with a few of each.  Seemed like someone just dumped them randomly in a box.  I didn't like most of these, and the donut house coffees of ""chocolate glazed donut"" and ""cinnamon roll"" didn't taste like they were named.  If you want to try out a bunch of different coffees, I wouldn't recommend this selection."
5.0,Semolina flour for making pasta,"This works great!  I followed the recipe on the back of the bag, except I put all the ingredients into my breadmaker, and let it mix/knead it.  Use it in my Atlas Queen pasta maker, and WALLAH!!!  Home made pasta!  I can't get it locally, so I subscribed for it, and get free shipping, with a pretty good price."
1.0,Careful to use it in Senseo!,"The Wolfgang Puck pads seemed tighter than other pods and smells good, so I thought it would be great. However, it turned out to be wrong and the pods made a huge mess. Because they are too thick to be fit into Senseo system, you have to force it to close. The worse thing is that the cap of Senseo pops up and steam and coffee (from torn pod)came out, due to the build up of steam pressure by thick coffee pads. I end up to open all the pods to make coffee in a regular dripping machine. Taste is good though."
1.0,Not real black currant flavor-very artificial taste,"This ""pure black currant extract"" tastes like artificial raspberry flavoring. It leaves a lingering and unpleasant artificial after taste. Over-priced and not at all natural in flavor."
5.0,Skyline Chili,I love Skyline and am so pleased to be able to purchase it at Amazon. The service is fast and pricing reasonable. I enjoy no other brand!
5.0,Choice chamomile/citrus tea in silk pyramids,"Beautiful,delicate presentation with pleasing fragrance and full chamomile citrus body...excellent packaging with silky tea pyramid encased in lovely, decorated paper Great for gifts"
1.0,Searcher of fine quality Olive oil.,"I was not happy with this product, for several reasons. First, it did not have a ""Best by date."" Secondly, I could not find the maximun acidity percentage on the bottle. Finally, the product did not have any superb taste, but was rather bland. It was also watery when I poured it for dipping. I am sorry but I will not buy this product again."
5.0,Best Herbal Tea,"I've been purchasing this product directly from the vendor and it's great.  It warms you up and has a great taste hot on a cold winter day.  It's also very refreshing iced on a hot summer day.  I make it by the pitcher, add some citrus fruit and enjoy!  I'm happy to see this product available on Amazon."
1.0,Yikes!!!!!,I cannot eat popcorn. I was looking for a suitable substitute. I thought these might do the trick after reading the reviews. Had to throw them away. Other people may like them but for me they taste pretty much like stale cardboard. Worst snack I have ever tasted.
5.0,"Easy peasy, good taste","I really love this rice! I work days and go to class nights, so I have to put forth an effort to keep healthy, quick options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for me at all times. This stuff stores well in my desk at work, and all I have to do is bring a package of frozen veggies and some soy sauce for a really fast and semi-healthy lunch or dinner.  As for the comments about the ""plastic flavor"", I've never noticed that. However, you don't have to keep the rice in the bag to cook it-- you can just as easily pour it into a bowl and heat it that way. I've cooked it in the bag (add a little mzithra cheese and butter- YUM) and other ways, too, and it always turns out great.  As options go for ""fast food"" this is one of the healthier options I've found. I totally recommend this (probably not from amazon, though, you can usually get these packets cheaper at your local grocery store...)"
5.0,My Beagle is 18years old,"He's been fed Pedigree for nearly his whole life.  Call it garbage if you will, but it's managed to keep him fit and healthy and happy for an unreasonably long time.  I'll keep buying it for as long as he'll stick around."
5.0,"Chipotle ""Herr""","We enjoy adding a half of a tablspoon of this product to a cup of decaf instant coffee. Note: We also add a half of a tablespoon of each of the two other Folgers drink mixes to the same cup of coffee. Altogether, it is a very satisfying drink in the morning and evening."
5.0,Mio Makes Water Taste Delicious!,"I love Mio and this was one of the very first flavors that I tried. I can no longer have sugar due to health issues and Mio makes it a lot easier for me to drink water. The container the Mio is in is leak-proof, so it is very portable and easy to take with you anywhere. You can also mix it in ANY amount of liquid and in any container. I have always hated that you have to have a plastic bottle to mix drink packets. With Mio you just have to briefly stir it in order to have the liquid completely mixed in.  You choose how much Mio to add to your water. If you like it strong and sweet, just add more Mio. If you want your flavor faint, then add only a tiny bit. It is easy, delicious and it doesn't have calories, carbs or sugar. The only bad thing I can say about Mio is that there is a lot of coloring and it can stain your clothes or desk. I do wish that it had less coloring.  The Fruit Punch flavor is one of my favorite. I always hated the heavy aftertaste of Koolaid and had to water it down to make it taste like an ""adult"" version. Mio tastes like the watered-down Koolaid only better. As I said previously, you can add more or less depending on your preferences. If you make it too strong, just add more water. It is completely customizable.  The Fruit Punch is my Husband's favorite flavor and my second favorite. You can literally add this to anything and I prefer it in carbonated water. We have a  Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit  and we use it to carbonate Mio flavored water. It is delicious. I have also added some to store bought flavored drinks that I didn't like the taste of. The possibilities are endless. I highly recommend that you try Mio Fruit Punch."
5.0,Can't wait to get it!,"For some reason, sometimes I can find certain McCormick seasonings in stock, and sometimes I can't.  (I am referring to the spice and seasoning packs, not the individual spices.)  Anyway, I tried this a few weeks back and LOVED it, but haven't found it since.  A few changes: Cannelli beans were very expensive at my supermarket, so I used a different kind of white bean.  Maybe Navy beans, but I am not sure.  I also used ground chicken rather than the chopped-up chicken breast called for in the directions.  So much easier.  And I browned the meat in olive oil, which I much prefer over veggie oil.  Also, as I recall, I had to add extra liquid later, so next time I would NOT drain the beans.  And be sure to add the tomatoes.  I did find this product a bit too spicy for me.  Next time, I'll just use 3/4 of the package.  But, other than that, loved it!  Not greasy at all.  I hope the seller I've selected hurries with my order, LOL."
1.0,not good at all,"This product had cocunat oil which I did not know about until I got it, which I am allergic to. The ingrentions should be listed before you buy. My husbund did not think they tasted good at all."
1.0,Voss Bottled Water,"I think anybody who buys bottled water ,especially high priced water in plastic bottles is an idiot.Could someone please explain to me why someone would go to a website ,buy some really expensive water in plastic bottles ,have it sent to them,think that there is some benefit to drinking high priced water in a plastic bottle?  I will listen with an open ear."
5.0,Great birthday gift,I sent this gift to my father for his birthday. It arrived right on time and he was thrilled with the contents. It has a wonderful variety and good flavor.
1.0,Received order completly thawed,Though the steaks look nice I received them completely thawed. Other online meat companies ship totally frozen so it was a shock to receive thawed meat. Never order this again.
5.0,Great addition for any cook!,I have been using my Aerogarden Classic for over a year and absolutely love it! It is great to have fresh herbs on hand anytime I need them and definately beats buying the packaged forms that go bad so quickly.  I love mine so much that I just purchaed a second one to grow an additional garden! I would suggest the Pro 200 or Deluxe if you want to grow full size veggies but for herbs or salad greens the Classic is just perfect.
1.0,Over Priced for the product,It's a famous sauce sold only in Hawaii. It's great and it's sorta sweet. but it will grow on ya. this size bottle normally sells for about 5 bucks an some change in most all the markets in Hawaii (Oahu). this is way over priced.
5.0,My friend's new favorite,"This is a friend's new favorite for a juice drink.  It comes in various size containers.  I personnaly prefer the smaller 6.75 ounce juice boxes (not listed), but it is all the same juice.  It is reconstituted apple juice with vitamin C added, and has a good flavor."
1.0,Doesn't work at all!,"This product does not work at all. I hang it in the kitchen for 5 days but no fly has been attracted!  It doesn't worth the time and money to return it. But please, buyer beware, I strongly suggest you go find some other item."
5.0,The dogs give it five stars!,"I figured that a dog food made with beef and Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor would smell really good to a dog, but I did a little test.  I put one dog's regular food in a paper bowl and the new food in another paper bowl--so that the bowls wouldn't interfere with the test.  Then I put the old food on the floor in its regular place, and I put the new food further away.  The dog smelled her regular food first, and then she started sniffing all over in the air until she tracked down the new food.  She gobbled that up and then ate her regular food.  The next time I put the new food further away--behind the dog food storge container--and she tracked it down and ate it first again before eating her regular food.  (I divided the food half and half so it would be her regular amount.)  ""Real Beef is our #1 ingredient"" it says on the bag.  In the list of ingredients that is followed by soybean meal, soy flour and lots of additives, including the dyes and corn products, etc., plus 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Green beans and potatoes are listed as garnishes.  There are crunchy kibbles and tender pieces, which I'm assuming is the beef.  It's for adult dogs, and the product is now made by the Nestle Purina Pet Care Company.  A company in Switzerland owns the trademarks.  (I trusted Purina.)  The instructions say to gradually mix the old regular food with the new, which I always do--except for the two tests.  Btw, while studying the information on the bag and making notes at the dining room table, the dogs were all over me.  One wanted to climb up on the table via my lap; fortunately he's short.  (He picked the beef pieces out of his regular food earlier; it was mixed together.)"
1.0,What sort of product description is this?,"I have not tried this product, and probably wont because when I tried to read the product description, I read the following:  ""Over 90% of All Men Will Develop an Enlarged Prostate or Some Type of Prostate Problem During Their Lifetime Most prostate problems such as prostate infection, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and Prostatitis are caused by an enlarged prostate. As you age, the likelihood of facing the problem of a swollen or enlarged prostate gland increases yearly. In fact, the chance of this happening to you is more than 90%. An Enlarging Prostate May be an Early Warning Sign of More Serious Prostate Problems""  Based on this, I already know what the prostate is and what it all means, but now I'd like to know what the product being sold actually does. The description wont enlighten me any more than what I knew before I read this."
1.0,Mal-function,"Every time I plug it to the wall, it short circuit all the plugs on the whole wall. Could not even start to use it."
5.0,Great Product,I have been allergic to chocolate for over 35 years now.  I have had carob chips and carob candy bars.  I found this carob powder by mistake actually and I am glad I did.  It arrived very fast and I made the most delicious carob cake with carob icing.  I wish I had known about this product much sooner.  Thanks Amazon.
5.0,Keeping doggie's teeth clean,"Since I am not inclined to brush my dog's teeth, the dental chews are a godsend. My dog loves them and they keep her teeth looking great! Her tail starts wagging as soon as I pick up the bag."
5.0,"Healthy, vegan, low fat goodness","I sit here eating this yummy soup as I write this review. I'm not a big fan of instant anything but sometimes convenience is just better.  Open flap, mix in spice packet, add water, cook a minute and a half, wait 8 minutes (the hard part) and there you have it...a very good tasting, hearty, filling soup.  I couldn't really taste the lime flavoring, so I added a little garlic powder and small scoop of low fat sour cream.  I bought this at my local Sprouts store for 1.79 each, so Amazon does have a pretty good price.  I love that I found another healthy vegetarian option for work that tastes great."
5.0,Mini Mandel Croutons,I love them in soup and because they are so difficult to find in this country they make a terrific gift for friends.  I had to buy an entire case so it's lucky my friends love them too so they really appreciate my supply.
1.0,Very Overpriced,"Beware -- very overpriced set, and the teas in it are low-end.  The company also has legendarily poor customer service.  Spend your money elsewhere."
5.0,"JUST THE FLAX, MA'AM","I wanted flax and, boy, did I ever get it!  The reviewer who said only one 40-ounce canister is included in this offer was wrong.  (Maybe he should inquire further about his order.)  I received TWO 40-ounce canisters, and that is a lot of flax!  Included inside each canister is a 2-ounce measurer (like you use with coffee), which is very convenient.  Also, I was pleased to read that because this is a cold-milled flax. it does not require refrigeration, unless you want to.  I am enjoying it mixed in my applesauce (gives it a thicker texture that I like) and sprinkled on my peanut butter on toast (gives the peanut butter a nutty texture).  This is an introduction to flax for me (and I guess I will be a pro at using it by the time I have used 80 ounces!).  I am glad I chose this particular product as my first experience with it."
1.0,use to be great........,"I've been buying this tea for years it WAS a great tasting tea,But no longer is.I'm now looking for a replacement."
1.0,Tastes like angel food cake,"I have been on a gluten-free diet for less than a year, and can still remember the taste and texture of my favorite, now-forbidden foods. In my opinion, the pancakes made from this mix had a very odd flavor. Finally it dawned on me what it reminded me of: angel food cake! Of the several gluten-free pancake mixes I have tried, I really have enjoyed only one, made by The Really Great Food Company ([..])."
5.0,Great buy in bulk,A member of my family chews gum all the time.  Purchasing in bulk has eliminated the weekly trip to the store to purchase gum.  The cost is about the same but the convenience is worth it.
1.0,Ruined by soybeans,"SOYBEANS?!  The whole attraction to cooking with duck fat (besides the flavor) is that it's a natural, healthy animal fat. Why on earth does this product need to contain soybeans (processed, not healthy)? Oh that's right, because the government subsidizes soybean farms and so soybean products must now appear in everything Americans eat. Reprehensible."
1.0,It isn't so much this item as it is all the listings---I want to buy less than case lots.,It isn't so much this item as it is all the listings---I want to buy less than case lots.Amazon story of opening grocery sales was carried on the news.  They said smaller lots are available---I cannot find any--So either way--if you do carry smaller lots the website needs to be reworked to make them easier to find OR you need to actually carry smaller lots.ind them
1.0,diseased and dying,"i bought one and it was delivered fast but the tree was soaked with water,the bark peeled off and trunk you could sqweeze water from very disappointed for $94."
5.0,Great tasting tea!!!,"This tea is fantastic. First tried it in a restaurant while out for dinner. Very happy with the way it arrived and was packaged. If you're a tea lover, I would highly suggest making this purchase."
5.0,GF Pie Crust,I have tried several different options for GF Pie crust/s.  This is by far the best...even the family quite likes it.  I use GF flour however at the end to ROLL out the crust...I use quite a bit actually and work it into the dough to make the dough a bit less sticky and easier to work with ... You can always roll it out a few times before getting it right...the ONLY good thing about GF flour...you can work it several times and it does not change the consistency.  Enjoy
1.0,INEDIBLE!,"Do NOT buy this product unless you enjoy eating sand. It tastes like regular peanut butter with beach sand mixed in. It actually made me gag. What a waste of money. I'm so angry, I am going to contact the maker. BLECH!"
5.0,Mojo flavor. Anywhere Amazon ships.,"When I moved from Florida to Massachusetts this year, I realized I took Cuban food for granted; it's just not common in the Northeast. And oh, how I have missed it!  If you've ever had pork, chicken or fish marinaded in mojo sauce, you're probably already sold on the flavor. This product - in 10 oz. bottles - allows you to marinade and cook a couple servings of your favorite protein with little or no waste of mojo sauce. I typically cook the chicken on the skillet with the sauce, then add the chicken to a bowl of yellow rice. It's simple, very flavorful, and hard to beat for the price and effort.  Although I cannot rave enough about the flavor, I'm not a chef and can't talk about tasting notes. What I can offer is a list of *some* of the ingredients used in homemade mojo: Garlic, OJ, Lime, Cumin, Oregano, Cilantro, and Olive Oil.  If you like the mojo, but just dont have access to it, I think the Amazon price is currently quite good. Get a few bottles."
5.0,Great Tahini,"This Tahini has made the best hummus I've ever had.  Even my Armenian friends thinks it is great.  My hummus recipe is 1/4 cup of chicken broth, 14 oz. can of chickpeas (garbanzon beans) drained, 3-4 cloves of garlic, 2 TBS lemon juice, 3 Tbs of this Tahini, and a pinch or two of cummin, and all mixed very well.  I have a high power blender that really makes this extremely creamy and good."
5.0,Best diet bars out there!!!,"I have eaten alot of bars lately, and these are the best. They were a little hard to find locally at first, but ahhhaahhh Publix has them for 2 for $3.00, not bad huh? Also from now til 12-31-10 thinkthin has a coupon you can use (print alot of copies ;)) for 50 cents off a single purchase. AND NO SUGAR!!!! I feel like I'm eating a chocolate cnady bar but I dont feel as guilty afterwards. These chocolate brownie one is good too, but nothing like these white chocolate bars. Thanks think thin!!!!"
5.0,Kitchens of India Curry Sauce,"Kitchens of India is the closest to a homemade curry we have ever had. We love it. The sauce is great and it is fast, so curry a few times a week is possible. We often make a curry from scratch but it is time consuming and now we can have a good curry whenever we want.  We have also tried the Rogan Josh as well as the Korma. Add some onions and raisins, or a bit of honey. The ingredients have little or no preservatives. The Best!!"
5.0,Bacon from heaven!,"We saw this product on Foodtv and my wife bought it for me for my birthday.  This is food of the gods.  I tried it initially on burgers and then on steak and then chicken and now I try something new with it every month.  You should not eat this cold but, placed on top of something warm, you will could make even my mom's horrible cooking taste good.  It seems risky but the 3 jar package is a better deal and you will not regret it!  Mmmmm bacon!"
1.0,Very unimpressive service and shipping,I ordered 5 bottles of Vimto from this vendor and received pretty quick feedback that they had been shipped. The first package had two bottles in it and the package had broken and had to be repaired by the post office....emailing the vendor got me a reply that said the others would come shortly but no mention of when. A little later another shipment of 2 bottles arrived and then a week later the third arrived. All were atrociously packed and one bottle had leaked....and all the shipments had needed repair by the post office. PATHETIC. I WILL NOT USE THEM AGAIN.
5.0,my 16yr old loves this!,"this is a better alternative to those red twisting treats that my daughter loves.  This also keeps her occupied and happy during those long trip rides.  of course i'm still limiting the amount of treat she can have, because this should not replace an actual healthy snack.  :)"
5.0,"Quick, easy, and delicious!!","I've been a fan of Betty Crocker Complete Meals (especially the Chicken and Buttermilk Biscuits) for a long time, but they're getting increasingly difficult to find in stores. I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon at a great price!  Making them is extremely simple: 1. Mix bisquick mix (included) and water in bowl 2. Pour soup (included) into a caserole dish 3. Mix in seasoning packet (included), milk and water 4. Plop bisquick into the caserole dish. 5. Bake for about 35 minutes 6. Eat up!  Each box makes 2-3 servings depending on how big of an eater you are. My wife and I easily finish off the box in one sitting.  Highly recommended for a quick, easy, delicious meal that takes minimal preparation!"
5.0,great product,"I ordered the Pizza flavor and I really enjoy them. I am on atkins and have been looking for something with a crunch for my salads. Just the cheese ""bites"" are awesome!"
1.0,"the bottle says 'key west lime juice', NOT 'key lime juice'","the title of this product is misleading, because you are NOT buying 100% key lime juice, but some possible blend of juices."
5.0,works great!,"Use this product almost daily. Love the convenient sizes and bowl that comes with this set. With summer coming, have set up subscribe and save so as not to run out."
5.0,Minty fresh...,"I just rescued a gorgeous basenji-cross 30-lb adult dog. And for a rescue, she has some pickiness about what she eats! But these, oh my gosh she gobbles these breathies in record time. But the thing I've noticed is we'll be sitting together on the couch and all of a sudden I get the smell of peppermint... and I'm not sitting in front of her mouth... if you catch my drift. There could be worse smells, so I vote for mint!"
1.0,Has yet to arrive,"I have an FPO address so orders often take 3 weeks to arrive.  But it has been over a month since I ordered it.  I am still hoping it will come.  Until it comes, I really can't rate it, can I?  The computer just insisted that I rate it, so I gave it a one, although a failure to arrive is really a zero, isn't it?!"
1.0,Received 5 instead of 6,"Ordered the Honey Roasted Cashews & Macadamias since I can no longer find them in stores and I went on auto ship.  When my first shipment arrived there were supposed to be 6 containers in the package and there were only 5.  I love it, even the enclosed invoice stated 6 containers but obviously someone can't count!  Cost too much to return but I will take myself off auto ship."
1.0,Very disappointing,"If you are a fan of Tassimo in general, this is not the coffee for you.  Bland, boring.  Skip it.  I miss Henry's Blend!"
1.0,Would not buy again,"This salami is not what I am used to when I buy Genoa salami.  Too much fat, great lumps of fat in the meat which I took out one at a time before eating what was left.  Very greasy.  Threw it all away in disgust.  Would not recommend to my friends."
5.0,Love it,"The Offspring being my favorite band, I had to try this. It has a really good taste, and I can't get over Dexter on the label. XD   PS- on their website, it has a recipe for beer mixed with some Gringo Bandito. For all the minors, just use coke. Not only is it good, but the reaction on people's face when you tell them it's mixed with hot sauce is priceless.   And finally, my personal favorite is a Wahoos' fish taco with a lot of GB on it. THAT is amazing."
5.0,Great for people on a diet,"I've been wondering how to cut back on meat, especially ground beef, because it is high in fat and cholesterol.  This tastes so much like meat, and is very satisfying.  I found it on sale at my local market for $1.29 a box, so I will buy from there until the sale is over.  Then I will come and order in bulk from Amazon.  I also like that it contains 3 grams of fiber per serving.  I am also going to try Fantastic Foods taco mix next."
5.0,Pleasure in a jar,"This stuff is super delicious. I look forward to waking up in the morning and having a spoonful of it. I use it for my shakes, afternoon snack, and sometimes right before bed.  I have noticed it reduces my sweet and carb cravings. A bit pricy but very tasty. This plus iluminal and I feel totally ready for the day."
5.0,Gives Ramen a more respectable name.,"I ate a lot of Top Ramen in college, as every poor student does. But I actually liked it and continue to make it today. I had a bunch of it in my pantry. Then friends turned me on to this stuff. If the only Ramen you know is what you had when you were broke, you MUST give this a try. It's unbelievably good."
1.0,"The Whippet says ""Pass""","I am not going to get into the nutritional side of this product because Brenda has done an outstanding job of covering that. The woman knows her dog food! I am simply going to tell you our dogs opinion of the taste quality:  Beckham is a two year old whippet who is more pup than dog. He typically eats Purina One for meals, meaty bones and pigs ears for snacks and a denta-bites for his teeth. His breeder (who I am sure was glad to see the backside of Beckham) recommended the above, well, okay not the pigs ears but that is just so deliciously disgusting to impose on the kids. Beckham has also been known to eat grass, slugs, deer poo and other revolting items. What Beckham will not eat is Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin. Said Sirloin has been hand fed to Beckham, hidden in with his standard kibble and offered as a treat for not pulling on walks. Nope, nope, nope, Beckham is not having it. Chef Michael please report back  to the kitchen.  Not recommended by Beckham. (Or Brenda)"
5.0,A Way To Enhance San Diego Tap Water.,"Mmmmmm, San Diego tap water. We get most of our drinking water from the lower reaches of the Colorado River, the waste drain for about 2/3 of the western US. Fortunately, the drainage basin is only sparsely populated. The water is safe. I've lived in San Diego for 49 years and there's never been a water problem of any magnitude. A lot of people won't drink it, including my wife. She'll only drink bottled water and the more expensive it is, the better it is. For a while she was drinking water imported from Figi and said it was the best water she's ever tasted. Well, you guessed it. It was also the most expensive bottled water she's ever consumed.  Some people say that San Diego tap water smells bad. Fortunately, my sense of smell isn't that keen. A lot of people say it tastes bad. I guess my sense of taste isn't so keen either. I don't mind San Diego tap water at all. One thing I do note is that if you fill a glass and then let the glass evaporate dry, the interior of the glass is coated with a scummy white lining. Well, If you're drinking the water, you're also consuming whatever all that white stuff is. I assume it's just mineral matter which is especially common in arid areas, but who knows?  In any case, I was recently browsing our nearby grocery store and found an interesting product. It's called MiO Liquid Water Enhancer and comes in a variety of different flavors. You put a drop, or any amount you might like, into a glass and then fill the glass with water, in my case tap water. There's no need to mix or anything. Now you have slightly flavored or enhanced tap water. The flavor I chose for trying was Berry Pomegranate. It says there's 24 servings in the little bottle, but the number would depend on how liberal you are with the little squirt you put in. I tried it a few times and prefer only a very slight enhancement, so my bottle will probably last a lot longer. I'm definitely not looking for something that tastes like soda pop. Well, the slightly enhanced San Diego tap water is kinda nice. It tastes good. The only odor I can detect is the slight fragrance of the additive. Hmmmm. This  stuff could be a big seller in areas like San Diego!  Gary Peterson"
1.0,stale,I've had this toffee many times and love it.  This was way overpriced and stale.  Big disappointment.
5.0,Can't do without 'em!,"I picked these up in the clearance rack at the grocery store and it was love at first bite.  They are no longer available locally but, thank heaven, I can get them here.  They are tasty, crunchy and nutritious.  I'm hooked!"
1.0,"Help, I'm melting","I was in Hawaii last year and bought these Mac nuts at Costco.  Loved them.  I ordered them and by the time they came to me, the chocolate had melted and then reset.  Not nearly as good as when I was in Hawaii."
1.0,Horrible wasabi peas,"Horrible wasabi peas.  These peas will crack your teeth, they are so old!  Very little wasabi coating as well.  Product of China with no data on when they were packaged and no expiration date.  Do not order."
1.0,Bad Price,"Unlike most other things we've found on Amazon, the price of this formula is terrible.  Diapers.com and Babies R Us offer much better pricing on this item, by almost $10 in some cases."
1.0,Low quality pet food,"Dont get deceived by cute advertisement for this food its horrible quality, primarily made of corn and byproducts(waste from human manufacturing), it also contains meat and bone meal from unidendified animals which can include roadkill and euthanized cats and dogs. Spend $5 more and get something better, few other options include diamond naturals, costcos kirkland signature, 4health(tractor supply), healthwise, canidae and whole earth farms."
5.0,I love this stuff....,"These are the soft type and very flavorful.  Plenty of ""chew"" but not tough.  Some of the flavors are a little vague but they are all really delicious."
1.0,BEWARE OF BUGS FROM THIS SELLER,"I love these bars.  I basically live off of them.  HOWEVER, this is now the second time that I have ordered them from Amazon where the internal boxes of bars have had bugs in them.  They looked somewhat like ants, but I wasn't sure what they were.  Just gross little crawly things creeping around inside and outside of the box.  I say beware because the bugs are tiny and you might think that they're not there when you open the package.  My advice would be to let the internal box of bars sit outside your cupboard on a counter for a day and see if you notice any bugs before you co-mingle the box with your household food. Gross, gross, gross.  So unhappy because other than that, these bars are great.  But I will never order them online from Amazon again.  Thank g-d Trader Joes and Ralphs are starting to carry this brand."
1.0,only one package!  Not two,Five stars for the coffee.  One star for the misleading description on the page.  The first line of the description states:  2 x 12 ounce bags of Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Whole Bean coffee  What an excellent price for two twelve ounce bags!  That's because you don't get two twelve ounce bags.  You only get one.  No returns allowed!  Fix the wording Amazon!!
5.0,The Best Maple Syrup I've Ever Tasted,"Half my family is from the Maple Syrup State of Vermont, so I've had a lot of good maple syrup in my time.  Coombs Grade B Organic is the best I've ever had, full of rich taste and minerals!"
1.0,Hey It's $6 per bottle apple juice!,"Let's see, the name of the product is 'Lakewood Organic Fresh Pressed Papaya'. Look closely, though, because behind the 3, count them 3, papayas on the label, there is an apple. Yep, and at the bottom of the label it does say blend. And it smells and tastes like Apple Juice, its MAIN ingredient. Private Note to Lakewood and Amazon: How about calling the product what it really is- Apple Juice with a little papaya? Honesty in advertising, anybody?"
5.0,Amazingly delicious!,"Love the flavor and texture of the Amazing Meal! It is so nutritious and delicious to have for breakfast, I truly love this product!"
1.0,Greedy Dealer Cut My Coke,"So, what happens when Coca-Cola gets involved in a perfectly good all natural tasting drink with all natural ingredients and no big plastic waste? It gets industrialized of course! This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.  Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying ""I told you so"" ever since this version was released. If so many customers hate it you just know that someone inside ZICO must have hated it too. Whoever that discerning person is has since been acknowledged I'm sure..."
5.0,Outstanding for Outdoors,We had a guy bring a dozen of these little jewels on a hunting trip and I almost hiked out in order to find more. I usually put in over 300 hours a year hunting and fishing and I am always searching for the right snack to pack. The Lil' Chub is not loaded with sugar which will make you crash and it's small enough that you don't over indulge. A hand full of crackers and one Lil' Chub will get through 3 or 4 hours without hunger. I can't wait to order them from Amazon. In 30 years of being in the outdoors --- THIS IS BEST SNACK IDEA I HAVE EVER SEEN...
5.0,Pretty yummy eye candy,"I love this Licorice Bridge Mix. I remember my Nana always having some of this around when I was little. I bought it to put in some Apothecary jars for decoration. I love the bright colors mixed with the pretty pastels and the black licorice jelly beans. My favorite pieces by far are the multi-colored sprinkle covered gum drops which I wish there were more of in the mix. Because there aren't very many of the gum drops, I place them around strategically to show them off better. This bridge mix also tastes good too. The little pastel pieces remind me Good and Plenty. Yum!"
5.0,Delightful,This wonderful organic tea is a delight. Perfect peppermint taste and oh so yummy especially near bedtime (no caffeine!). Very tasteful as well as soothing. Enjoy!
1.0,awful,"This is not jerky, this is processed, hard like a rock, very greasy and stale smelling stripe of something that you can't break into anything smaller than 2 inches long and that certainly is not the size of a training treat! The dogs- who will eat anything- were not impressed, it was hard to chew, and it sounded like they were crunching rocks, where is a zero star button?"
5.0,Damn Good!,"This is an amazing finishing salt. Big, bold smoke flavors. I've also used it as a brining salt with some liquid smoke, seasonings, and the usual brining liquids. Tastes like it was cooked in a smoker and, since I live in a highrise, that's a nice alternative."
5.0,Yum!,My favorite of flavored coffees! All types of Gloria Jeans coffee are wonderful and definitely recommended. :)
1.0,stale,candy was very stale. i didnt send it back because i had to pay for it. i usually get great service from amazon but not this time. i just chalk it up as a loss.thanks bob delp
1.0,rip off,i didn't realize it was one box of 12 1 oz.pouches for $23.  i would never pay that when i can go to the store down the street and pay $2-$4 depending on a sale.  i thought it was a pack of 12 being  the number of boxes in the order. they definitley got me. hope this prevents someone else from being ripped off. lesson learned.
1.0,Fruit & Branch Mangler,"This picker will get the fruit, but it usually gets some of the branch as well and sometimes rips off a whole branch. It pulls the fruit off. If the fruit does not come off easily, which my oranges usually don't, I have to pull hard. When the fruit finally comes loose, the back snap of the branch sometimes causes other oranges to fall to the ground and get bruised or broken. The wire hooks can damage the fruit unless you are very careful.  The wire basket can be difficult to thread through the branches. It is also difficult to grab a single fruit in a cluster.  Get the TwisterPicker also available here on Amazon. It beats the wire basket hands down. Read the reviews there before you buy here. Here's the link:   Fruit Picker, the TwisterPicker "
1.0,"Weak On Vanilla Flavor, not worth the price","I enjoy a flavored coffee occasionally.Jean's French Vanilla Supreme, lacks largely in Aroma and Flavor, nill or none of either. Very disappointed, will not buy again nor will I recommend it."
5.0,Gordon Setter's Favorite,"I've been experimenting with different dog foods for the past year and a half and this has been by far the most heavily favored dog food by my bird dog (Gordon Setter). It best's all the other foods I've tried in a side by side taste test performed by my dog, who eats the Acana to the exclusion of the other foods. If he likes it and he's healthy and looks good - I'm in! Thanks for the great product."
5.0,"Quick, Easy, Convenient & Delicious","I've been looking for a prepared Japanese curry product that had the same taste as the beef curry they used to serve at my favorite Ramen shop, before they stopped selling it (I guess I was the only one who would order it).  This is about as close as I've found to it, and it's incredibly easy to make.  Makes a great quick lunch out of the microwave with some rice, or you can add in some cooked meat (great use of leftovers!) and make a full meal of it.  They also say that you can put it over spaghetti or some other cooked pasta, but that's just a little too strange for me to try.  This also works extremely well for camping since it's boil-in-bag and hermetically sealed, or could just be something to keep in the pantry for the long term.  It says ""HOT"" but if you've ever tried other types of Japanese-style curry, the scale of mild to hot is incredibly weak, with mild flavors coming closer to a sort of gravy and hot flavors not even reaching the level of the blandest Indian curry.  House Hot curry is very heavy on the apple and is rather sweet, but there's certainly enough spice to make it tastier than the milder flavors and there are a surprisingly large number of veggies for such a small pouch.  I'll definitely be ordering another batch once I've gone through the current one."
5.0,It really did help,It really did help my father is a cancer patient and. Didnt want to eat because the taste was no good.well the miracle berry gave him a good taste again
5.0,Delish!,"Very good. Select different cup size for stronger/weaker taste. More expensive because it is Starbucks, but good taste...better than the Donut Shop(by Coffee People)"
5.0,licorice pastels,"I have ordered from SweetGourmet.com before and I have never had a bad experience. My only comment is the candy that I ordered was a bit stale. It is hard to find the pastels and when I find them I do purchase them. I resently found a candy store that sells the old fashion candy and they had the pastels. Which were softer and fresher, I will give SweetGourmet.com a try again."
5.0,no complaints,It's hard to find all natural mints.  My children are even able to enjoy.  I'll be back for more
5.0,Great Product,"Nutiva coconut oil,is great in cooking, using as a moisturizer. The main reason I'm writing this is because when I first started taking about 6 mouths ago, just basically eating a good spoonful a day my blood pressure was a lot lower, I quit doing that for a while and it went back up. I started eating it again recently and have been checking my blood pressure and its lower again, which is great. Just wanted to share that."
5.0,Still the best,"The Oh Henry remains the single best standard (medium track) candy bar available in the US.  Indeed, I would argue North America as a whole, although I do respect the advocates of the Aero.  While we're on the subject of Canadian candy bars, you should be aware that the Canadian Oh Henry bar is actually manufactured and distributed by Hershey, not Nestle; although I have a fondness for the Hersey company, once having worked near their original factory in Pennsylvania, both are now reputable companies, in contrast to some others I won't name.  I think part of the glory of the O.H. is the simplicity which has allowed it to work as a combination even with the inevitable pressure to cheapen ingredients and chemicalize.  American candy as a whole has been hurt by this sort of cheapening, and I think this most affects wafers.  I understand that wafer based bars (like Kit Kat) are very popular, because the crisp wafer can be a vehicle to hold some of the sugar apart from the thicker ingredients, and so it gives a sparkle when you first bite in, but given that most of the caramel type fillers are corn syrup with very simple flavorings, and the quality of most wafer if you taste it on its own is pretty low, I think it makes sense to go for something with nuts--most peanuts stay peanuts no matter what.  Further, and I'm not pointing fingers, I would have some concerns about cleanliness at any place that is using a lot of wafer, because unless flour storage is done in a satisfactory manner, you can find that the stocks are contaminated by various forms of fungal or animal life.  That wouldn't happen at a great firm like Nestle's, but that doesn't mean it can't happen elsewhere.  Having once had a foot in the larger business, I've become more cautious--still love the great Oh Henry bar! [4]"
1.0,Not good for your dog,Do your research of the ingredients before you buy this for your dog to eat. Would you feel safe about feeding this to your dogs I wouldn't. Just cause it has a fancy packaging doesn't mean that it's any good.
1.0,A  Joke,"The box is cute enough, but could they SPARE the seeds? Only about 1/4 of the poorly rationed seeds grow and in one square only a few sprouts appeared. Don't waste your money."
1.0,Plastic chocolate and sugar..,"These look a lot like a sweet treat when you first open them, I expected a bit of a rewarding experience to eat one. They smell really good when you open them! They have a rich, oaty, chocolate vibe.  My first bite was almost the last. It left a stinging, burning sensation in my mouth as soon as I started to chew; the chocolate was like bitter stinging plastic across my palate. The bar was sticky, chewy, and had an unpleasant feel in my mouth.  Of course when I saw that the ingredients are sugar, dextrose, corn syrup, glycerin...sugar sugar and sugar. One bar (they are small!) has 7 grams of sugar. ""Soluble corn fiber"" as first ingredient? It has a lot of soy in it as well, more than I expected to see in a granola bar. It's like a bunch of gunk bound together with sugar.  For a net carb count of 13 grams (over half that sugar), there isn't enough nutritional redemption in them for me to even consider packing them as a snack. A mere 4 grams of fiber for such a tiny bar, and it probably comes mostly from the corn? The Fiber One bars I've had, taste better for sure. I've never had a stinging and prickling sensation in my mouth from eating a GRANOLA BAR...it was disconcerting. For what it's worth, my husband liked them. But there isn't much he DOES NOT like."
1.0,Tastes Terrible!!!,"I love hollandaise sauce, but this stuff smelled horrible and tasted even worse... by far the worst thing I have ever tasted"
5.0,Just what I wanted,"I was not sure what the product would taste like, since it had to be ordered, and I was looking for natural fruit that I could enjoy and would be like a ""melt in your mouth"" type of dried fruit. This product was EXCELLENT in what I was wanting and the taste was just as awsome, I would let anyone know that if they are looking for a dried fruit with all the natural taste of fruit, this is it. I have never had a problem with any orders from Amazon"
5.0,Delicious and helps with my morning sickness,"I ordered these to help with my morning sickness.  I feel car sick all day long generally.  Munching a bit on these really does help!  My husband also loves them!  The flavor it very good.  My son (who is 2) also enjoys them.  They have a good, strong ginger flavor, but it's not too much.  I'm glad we got so many little bags of them cause they will stay fresh longer.  The texture is good.  The pieces are firm to hold but soft to chew.  I'd recommend this product to someone dealing with morning sickness, or any ginger fan.  I'm both, and quite pleased!"
5.0,No butter Needed!,"This is the best microwaveable popcorn I've ever tasted, and I taste every kind I can find.  The natural flavor gives the hint of nutty and buttery and all the flavor I thought I remembered as a kid on movie night.  I just wish they carried it in the stores around me. I was very happy when Amazon finally started stocking it!"
1.0,bad buhtjolokia buy,"I thought I was buying a plant, not a kit to grow. Should have been clear about the product, and it did not even grow."
5.0,good stuff,Love our flavored coffee.  Easy to throw some in pocket book for travel.  Company enjoys trying it too.
5.0,Great organic option,I bought a single pack of this 1st to try and it was alot less 'horrifying' then some reviews lead you to believe. I just mixed with plums spinach peas and pear to loosen it up some as it's a bit thick because of the grains and barley but after mixing it becomes a hearty nutritious organic option that my baby doesn't mind..and she's picky! Just mix with something your child likes and it's a great healthy addition!
1.0,Basket with stale food,"I had purchased this basket of goodies to give my bf for our 2nd year anniversary. The basket was beautifully presented, but the food items in it was OLD and Nasty. The crackers were stale and so was everything else. He said that the only thing good about it was the cheese...but what can you eat from that basket with that cheese??"
5.0,minty green,"I love the health benefits of green tea, but the taste? not so much. Of all the green teas I've tried I like this one the best (followed by those that include  Jasmine). I had trouble finding this in my local grocery stores, eventually finding it at Von's and Ralph's in So. Cal. Then I found I could get it from Amazon, and with a nice savings as well. Tasty with a nice fragrance also."
1.0,terrible,"firstly, the packaging. all of the tubs were opened, plastic cracked, tubs lids do not fit the bowls so they can't actually close and seal the contents, it looked like one tub was eaten out of, apricots missing. Looks like this stuff gets shipped from turkey and they repackage it in Brooklyn into really lousy packaging that does not fit. i used to live in Brooklyn, that place is full of rats. the fact that all the tubs came opened, lids don't fit, and plastic seal is broken is beyond disgusting. i can only imagine under what circumstances they were repacked down there in brooklyn. again disgusting.  finally these are not Natural Apricots, they are full of Sulfur Dioxide for preservative. If i could give this mess a negative 5 stars I would."
5.0,Great find,I've tried other organics and found this to have great ingredients - actual lactose rather that brown rice sugar - and it mixes well.  Others (namely Similac organic) have a gritty texture where this powder mixes to the consistency of actual milk.
1.0,THE PANTRY PEST TRAP (Safer),"Like of nowhere, we suddenly had two or three moths in our pantry every morning. Hence, we set up the two Pantry Pest Traps directly inside the pantry and left the doors open for two days. Surprisingly, moths kept flying or resting under the shelves and not a single one was attracted to the lure. They totally ignored the traps and not a single one got caught. In my opinion a very bad investment at over $6 for two useless traps."
1.0,All the same...,"I think its quite gimicky.  The same candy are represented in all the different decades.  The idea is that each decade you get that particular candy, but its all the same crap no matter what the decade box its in.  Take a look!  Lollypops, Mike&Ikes, etc...  Very gimicky and cheap!"
1.0,Bland and disappointing..,"I was familiar with a few of Wolfgang's recipes before I tried any of his soups. First I tried a different flavor a year ago, but can't remember anything except it being bland and slimy.  I decided to try it a 30 minutes ago because I was desperate for something healthy and convenient because I was a tad sick and could not make my own unprocessed meal with the ingredients I had home. I bought it for about $3 and hoped I just had a bad can of soup the first time, but this was just awful. No taste, slimy, and hardly any chicken (probably 3-4 tiny pieces). I can see why they added such little chicken. It's just tasteless and dry; tasted nothing like chicken. I'll go try another can of soup that can make me feel a bit better. This sure didn't do it. I have never had soup that tasted bland even after adding salt and seasoning. I see positive reviews that make me thing I had another bad can because I still can't believe it had absolutely no flavor."
1.0,Awful,"Just popped a bag of this popcorn. I was excited because i love cheddar popcorn. I opened the popped bag and dug in. Only to find that the popcorn didn't taste anything like cheddar. I can't even describe what it tasted like. Kinda antiseptic..ewww, it's awful. Through out the whole bag."
5.0,Vegan hot cereal that tastes great,"Add water, microwave for less than 2 minutes. Let set then eat. Great for a busy morning or a healthy filling snack."
1.0,It's full of sugar,"The product description in Amazon is misleading.  The description says ""Pinole Ground Corn"" and it even suggests adding brown or white sugar to it.  But it is already full of sugar, which is exactly what I didn't want."
1.0,DECEIVING and DISAPPOINTING product!!!,"This product is promoted as ""Jamaican Me Crazy,"" leading me to believe that it's the famous and highly-sought after type of coffee known as ""Jamaican Blue Mountain"".  Regrettably, it is NOT. It is some sort of ""flavored coffee"" and yet it does not even say WHAT it is flavored with! (I made some and I still can't tell.) Moreover, it does NOT taste good. In summary, I am really disappointed with this product."
5.0,It's the best Jerry - the best!,"I first had this in 1980, in Germany. I've since found various importers through the years and now am happy to see it on Amazon. Everyone I've ever shared this with loves it and wants more. Subtle curry taste that creeps up on you. Awesome on burgers, bangers (sausages) - even chicken nuggets."
1.0,Disappointing,Not hot enough. Package was much smaller than expected and price was way too high.  Much better off with Blue Diamond Wasabi or Jalapeno.  Very disappointed.
1.0,Tasted bad. Tossed most in the trash,I lived in the islands for 5 years and I know coconut water.  This stuff is garbage. Tasted rancid. Not happy!
1.0,Yuck!,"There are WAY too many flavors going on in this breakfast cookie...at least for my tastebuds.  Whomever was in charge of adding spices really went too far -- to the point that it is actually nauseating.  Obviously, I won't be ordering this one again."
5.0,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!","I have tried alot of different rubs but this one may the BEST ONE YET!! A GREAT FLAVOR, worked GREAT on beef and pork!!"
5.0,"Y U M....  ! ! ! !....  : ),","W A R N I N G:  THIS IS DELICIOUS CHEESE, BUT, LIKE ALL CHEESE, SHOULD BE EATEN IN MODERATION.  IT IS N O T FOR THE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT, OF COURSE -- AND TOO MUCH CAN MAKE ONE FAT AND VERY THIRSTY!!!!!  Velveeta Loaf Mexican Mild, 16-Ounce Loaves, (Pack of 6), arrived soon after I had ordered it, in perfect condition!  The taste is a bit spicier than regular Velveeta, but that is to be expected, from the name of the item.  The extra spiciness is perfect for making Mexican-style sandwiches, and spicing up any recipe that calls for cheese.  As with regular Velveeta, there are recipes printed inside the box -- three of them beneath the box that I have first opened.  Since this cheese, (a perishable item), and other cheeses, (also perishable items), are happily available on Amazon, I would like to suggest that the simple METHOD of preservation used in pack- ing Velveeta cheese be used, whenever possible, to preserve OTHER perishable items, (like more FROZEN FOOD, and perhaps even the legendary, (but, presently on Amazon, HORRENDOUSLY expens- ive) TUSCAN MILK!  (The great expense is now charged by 3rd 0arty sellers...not Amazon.  But if the Velveeta Cheese method is used,  in the near future, maybe both these 3rd-party sellers, and amazon itself, could sell this legendary milk at a lower price?)  The method is simply............wrapping the Velveeta cheese in ALUMINUM FOIL, SHINY SIDE OUT.  The non-shiny side of the aluminum foil is presumably very slightly coated, (?), thus not allowing full aluminum to touch the cheese -- as well as allowing the aluminum on the outside to act as preservative. Another way to prserve other perishables, (including THE legend- ary Tuscan Milk!), would be to FREEZE all these perishables until JUST before shipment!  I know, I know -- Velveeta Mexican cheese uses Sorbic Acid as a prservative, (list of all ingredi- ents given below) -- but milk, I have read, can be prserved. not only by freezing, but by the addition of A FEW GRAINS OF EXTRA SALT!  Just think of ALL the delicious frozen food, usu- ally sold only in groceries, that could be sold here on Amazon with just a few extra freezers in the basement of Amazon Head- quarters, and a few grains of extra salt added into those products for which it is convenient to so do!  In the meantime, I'm going to use my Velveeta Loaf, Mexican Mild to try to make home-made pizzas, and other creative, spicy dishes!  INGREDIENTS:  Milk, Whey, Whey Protein Concentrate, Milkfat, Milk Protein Concientrate, Sodium Phosphate, Salt, Jalapeno Peppers, Vinegar, Sorbic Acid as a preservative, Sodium Algin- ate, Apocarotenol, (colour), Enzymes, Cheese Culture  NOT the healthiest thing to eat, I know.  But it sure is healthier than candy!  My mom has told me that, since I have been a cheese-lover all my life, she gave me cheese as a child, instead of candy, as it is obviously healthier than most, if not all candies!  I think this is an excellent idea, if given to children in moderation!  And cheese from Velveeta Mexican Loaf is extra spicy and delicious!"
1.0,"For this price, it's great ... but not at the $15 Petco charges!",It is inferior to the 10 year old version I have. Pivots in a strange way making it difficult to use (followed poor directions) AND the blade clearance isn't tight enough so it leaves the 'outer shell/skin' of the nail present requiring a file or the use of my old original cutter. Argh.
1.0,Not Organic...,"I place a couple spoons of organic coffee plus organic soy milk, bring it to boil and then enjoy my coffee. My place is full of coffee aroma using soymilk and can even smell the coffee after I return to my place few hours later. Soyilk is very time consuming to make, so not my gig. SILK soy milk was the first SM that I tried few years ago and it was the worst soy milk I ever tried. Watery, awful tasting. Furthermore SILK did not sell organic soy milk. I even tried to contact SILK to find out if their soy was a GM , they would not respond. Sweeteners are added to all Plain soy milk to change the bitter taste of soy but vanilla does not since vanilla is a sweetener itself so calories are the same but vanilla tastes better. I even tried my coffee with almond milk, whole organic milk, etc. and none comes close to the taste of soy milk."
1.0,"This was huge, full of chemicals and I sent it bacl","I tought it would be healthy and an Easter treat for my grandkids.  I was not either one. If you are looking for a healthy snack, not this."
5.0,Melts in Your Mouth!,"I live in the Philippines and the last time I had Flavored Tootsie Rolls was on my last home leave to the U.S.  I couldn't believe it when I found them online through Amazon.  At first, it bothered me that I had to buy a dozen bags as a minimum purchase but after the shipment arrived, I just gave some out to my Filipino and American colleagues."
5.0,Outstanding Balsamic,"If you like really good almost syrupy Balsamic vinegar, Villa Manodori is an outstanding value."
5.0,Love this!  More natural than most!,"Great grape candy taste without artifical flavors, sweeteners and colors.  THANK YOU CRYSTAL LIGHT!  Create more flavors like this!"
5.0,Easy and delicious,"We ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly! My husband and I both like taking them to work for lunch. Here's my recipe, so that I get more protein: I slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before I leave home in the morning, then I add the egg to the water before I cook it at lunchtime."
5.0,Great Tasting Lemonade,"The Lemonade flavor is excellent.  I like to make it a bit on the strong side, by putting over half of an entire package into a 64 oz ""Super Big Gulp"" sized container, instead of using the package to make 80 oz of the drink.  Add ice, and you have the best tasting Lemonade on planet earth, and enough of it to last the entire day.  The package could be made simpler to open, but since I started to put over one half of the entire package in a giant container, it does not matter to me any more.  Just cut the top off with your kitchen scissors.  I add a couple teaspoons of an algae/ veggie/ mineral product to the drink, and o-m-g it is the best tasting way I found to get my daily veggies and minerals."
1.0,Another company lying about their product,"As a migraine sufferer, I have to be very careful around MSG. After reoccurring headaches and unable to pinpoint the cause I discovered the misleading claims on the Lawry's seasoning salt. ""Natural Flavor"" is MSG! It was giving me headaches. I stopped eating it and headaches went away. Thanks a lot Lawry for trying to hurt your consumers!"
1.0,NOT chocolate: FALSE LIST OF INGREDIENTS,"Extremely disappointed in this product. It barely tastes of cinnamon at all and is downright gross. My main complaint, however, is that it's not chocolate at all. It's a cake of sugar held together with dyed brown vegetable fat with a bit of cocoa liquor thrown in as an afterthought. Unbelievable that they market it as chocolate. And the list of ingredients on this product page conveniently leaves out the fact that it contains vegetable fat, which is clearly states on the package. It also does NOT contain cacao nibs, but rather cheap cacao liqueur. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS FATS in the form of manteca/vegetable fat, also known as hydrogenated oil or Crisco. Don't let the legal loophole of ""0 grams"" fool you."
5.0,Great Value and Excellent Product!,We've priced around and these seem to be the best value thus far on Amazon. Our dogs love pigears and a WHOLE pig ear seems to be a bit much. We like these 'slivers' that seem to be an ideal size for a quick snack and to keep the dogs busy. They are good quality and they seem to really enjoy the flavor and textures. Would definitely reccommend.
5.0,My Favorite Szechuan sauce!,"I use this every day. I eat plain white jasmine rice with this sauce, and it's delicious. Or I eat coconut rice with it and it's delicious. I eat ramen noodles with this instead of the powdered flavoring and it's delicious. I make my orange tofu with my orange juice/Szechuan sauce marinade, and it's delicious. This is by far my favorite condiment!  It's spicy hot, the way I like it, but it's not take-the-back-of-your-head-off hot, not overwhelmingly hot for me. It's good to eat spicy things because it helps keep your blood thin. But, if you can't stand heat of any kind, this sauce is not for you.  The only thing I would improve is for it to be made without high fructose corn syrup. That having been said, of the other brands of Szechuan-style sauce out there, House of Tsang has less and tastes the best!"
5.0,Excellent wine and i'm going to make two more of them right away,I bought this kit and I have to say that it was a hit. It was originally bought for my wife but then she decided to trade off 15 of these for 15 of the White Zin that we were making for a friends wedding. At the wedding it went quick and many people were asking me to make it for them. MY answer was here is where you buy the kit and if you want to buy it and the bottles I would be happy to make it for you. I do not have a license to sell it since this is just a hobby for me.  I did add one can of white grape concentrate after the F-pack was added and that added so much more flavor.  I promise that you can't go wrong with this kit if you like a sweet chardonnay.
1.0,Made by Diamond Pet Foods,"I dropped the ball when I ordered a large bag of this for my dogs.  I love the Chicken Soup books, and I figured that the company would also produce good quality dog food.  Imagine my surprise to find out that Diamond Pet Foods, which has had numerous problems, is the one behind this.  There is a news article today about this company and people getting sick from salmonella just from handling the dog food.  I feel cheated, but it is my own fault for not doing enough research on the product.  And my dogs didn't care for it anyway.  I wound up mixing it with another brand.  Had I but known, I would have returned it.  Live and learn, and I am glad that my dogs survived it."
1.0,kernelly popcorn,"This order so far with the first two boxes, have been very kernelly to say the least. Not like the previous order I rec'd last year directly from the popcorn maker. I don't know if this order sat in the warehouse for a long time or the popcorn company used an OLD popcorn!!"
5.0,A versatile  soup,"Poured over hot toast, your oven roast, or eaten as soup, hot or cold...a tasty, nutritious, and economical meal every time...a great addition to your menu."
5.0,Happy Pups at our house,Nice small size treat that helps my big dogs watch their waistline and stay healthy.
5.0,Best Cat Food,"I have a beautiful golden Bengal cat who loves Iams.  I have fed her Iams since she was 8 weeks old.  Bengals are known for their appetities and playing.  My Bengal will not eat any other kind of cat food.  I feel very, very secure knowing she is eating the best."
5.0,SMOKEHOUSE ALMONDS,"LOVE TO EAT THESE AS A SNACK WHILE WATCHING TV. THE SMOKEHOUSE FLAVOR IS DELICIOUS. ADDITIONALLY, I ADD THEM TO MY BREAKFAST CEREAL WITH FRUIT. SOME MORNINGS, I ADD PEACHES. OTHER MORNINGS I ADD PEARS"
1.0,Where are the ingredients?,"For those of us buying Diet soft drinks, the sweetener used often becomes a vital piece of information. Why even bother offering diet tonic for sale if you don't tell us this? Many diet tonics are STILL made with saccharin (tastes AWFUL). We want to know BEFORE we order."
5.0,Mary's Gone Crackers,This product has been such a delight. I have a gluten problem and love every variety of this line of crackers. I will reorder this again. It is so nice to find this available when so many people have a digestive disorder. Thanks so much for having this product.
1.0,Chemical aftertaste,"I'm a regular stevia user, but this is the first, last, and only time I'll use this product -- or any stevia product that is artificially flavored or extracted with alcohol.  The chemical aftertaste from this product was overpowering and distasteful.  For a better stevia product, try SteviaClear by SweetLeaf -- the only stevia product I use."
5.0,Nice bags,"These bags are large enough for my hands, & keep the stink in when tied. Thick enough that moisture won't come out & handles sticks, wood chips, & rocks well."
1.0,Inaccurate nutritional values,"As another reviewer has noted, the nutritional values posted on this website are wrong. If you are on a sodium restricted diet as I am, the sodium content posted here (140mg) is less than half the value printed on the can (310mg). The only nutritional value posted here that matches that on the can is for protein."
5.0,"Good price, great taste","I am not a coffee aficionado, but I like coffee.  A friend often brings back 10 and 100% Kona from his trips to Hawaii, and I finally decided to search online and Amazon.  The price was quite acceptable for 100% Kona, and it tasted great to me.  Your mileage may vary."
1.0,Not the same candy cigarettes i had as a kid.,"I have to say, either the other reviewers have lost their memories, or they did not have the same candy cigarettes that i had as a kid.  These are not the same things, they are a cheap knock off with a different taste and texture.  I am saddened by the people who thought these were the same things, that some of us remember as a kid.  Maybe they are younger than me and did not get to taste the wonderfulness of the original ones or maybe they have just forgotten.  These imitations are just as someone else had stated on a different set of the same cigarettes.  I thought maybe since this one had better reviews, that it might be a different manufacturer selling the same cigarettes.  However i was wrong.  The other person is absolutely right.  These cigarettes do not have that chalky texture that the originals had.  Sure you may say, well isn't that a good thing.  No, it is not.  It wasn't like they tasted like chalk.  If anyone remembers pepto-bismal and how it was the only thing you actually didn't mind taking when you were sick.  You remember that flavor was very similar to the flavor of candy cigarettes.  The new texture is more gooey and chewy, which just doesn't feel the same when you eat them.  The flavor was similar to wintergreen breath savers, but a little different in the originals and the new one is an off flavor of the same but just doesn't taste as good to me.  This product has left me completely disappointed, since i was hoping to get the same candy cigarettes i had as a kid, but am now left with 24 boxes of candy cigarettes that i do not even enjoy.  If you are a fan of the originals and remember the greatness of them, you will be hugely disappointed when these arrive.  The only way you will enjoy these, is if you never got to experience the originals in the first place and must have had these ones all along.  Luckily though, they were under 8 dollars with free shipping from amazon, otherwise i would be demanding a refund.  I guess i will just give them out to random friends and hope they enjoy them.  I miss the originals, but now after trying these i am afraid they are gone forever.  Also, i forgot to mention, the size of each box and the cigarettes inside are almost half the size of the original ones as well."
5.0,Introduction to Indian cooking,"These are small sizes, but with this, a few other spices and oils, and Bal Arneson's excellent and easy Everyday Indian, you're ready to begin!"
1.0,Bad taste!,This tea had a horrible taste so I threw it out in the trash.  Thank heavens I found another ginger tea here on Amazon which is truly a wonderful ginger tea.
5.0,Great BBQ Sauce,"I was excited to find this BBQ sauce online.  I had previously bought it from a small country store in upstate New York and could only get it when I visited relatives.  This is my dad's favorite and is a staple for Christmas, his birthday and Father's Day.  The seller was great too!  He called to tell me when he was shipping the package, so I could keep an eye out for it.  Will order again!"
5.0,SO DELICIOUS YOU WON'T GET TO BAKING WITH IT,"If you're a choco-holic you probably like everything that comes your way, like Hersheys, or even lesser brands.  As long as it's chocolate, it's good.  But then we had the pleasure of having a German girl come to visit us, and she brought some of the ""real"" stuff from her country, and it just strikes you how much better the higher quality stuff is.  I'm not denigrating Hershey's or Nestles or whatever--all right, I am, though I still like those brands too.  But try this chocolate, and you'll know what I mean.  It's a semi-sweet bar and therefore made for cooking, so it's not going to taste as sweet as normal chocolate you get in this country, but trust me: you'll probably never get to cooking with it.  We handed some out to friends to show them the difference, and ate the rest ourselves.  It's pricey (we paid about $16) but you get six bars for it.  The pieces are a bit big, so the bar goes pretty fast.  But taste it: it's sweet, but the most amazing quality is its RICHNESS.  It has a very full quality to it--there are three real sensations with most food: the first taste when you bite it, then the ""mouthful"" taste, then the lasting or after-taste as it disappears down your gullet--and all of these tastes are of CHOCOLATE.  Not sugar, not additives..nothing but full, rich CHOCOLATE.  It's really wonderful.  There's nothing quite like it."
1.0,Where the Coffee???,"I ordered this product not once, but twice and have never received my order.  It has been over a month and many e-mails, but no coffee.  Thus, I spent over one hundred dollars and no follow up from the vendor.  Go figure???  Simply put, do not buy from this vendor.  I will try a third time today, but I expect the same result.  Amazon you should be black list this vendor after sending me to them when I placed my order with you.  I want my coffee or my $$$ now!  You should be following up on this order not me!"
5.0,Lasts a long time!,"When these bones arrived, my dog KNEW that something inside the box was for her. On Christmas day, we opened up the box and unwrapped one of her bones. The knuckle fell off (i'm assuming it got tossed around a lot in shipping) but no worries, Munchkin ate that as well. We put the bone on her blanked she normally uses to play on to help keep the mess down. Munchkin, a 100-pound 8 month-old Newfoundland is STILL working on her bone. Lasts a long time and provides hours of chewing time!"
5.0,Cutest Little Pods of Coffee,"I read reviews on this product and was a little concerned that they were not K-Cups, but made for K-Cup machines.  No concern was ever needed. It looks like a little round coffee filter full of coffee and a lid!  Think about it.  It works in my Keurig just fine!  And it makes a ""Big"" cup of ""Bold"" coffee.  These pods can easily compete with K-Cups.   San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 36-Count "
5.0,The real stuff,Pumpernickel bread the way it used to be - great in a sandwich and great toasted with butter!  Gave a few loaves as gifts!
1.0,"No, Never, No","The only thing I can think about this drink is that it has to do something positive for the body to taste this terrible. I thought it was going to be a nice light beverage like herbal tea. I was wrong. It's thicker (and yes, I used the right amount of water). It may have been better if it were carbonated but that's a long shot too.  This rates as the worst taste experience of my life. Seriously."
5.0,Gorgeous gummies!,"These arrived in just 2 days and are so pretty and colorful! Also, they are very soft and fresh and pretty tasty too! My grandkids loved them!  Got these on auto ship....way too good a deal to pass up!"
5.0,Best GF Bread,What a relief when I discovered the G-F Pantry bread!!  I was diagnosed with Celiac several years ago at the age of 59.  What a life change.  Tried the rice breads but they just didn't come close to a bread product.  I add fiber and honey to the bread and it does not change the consistency at all.  I did find that using a large bread pan works best.  Thank you G-F Pantry for a very user-friendly product.
5.0,Tasty!!!!!!!,"This is one of my favorite K Cups out now.Very good cappuccino,and the price is right.I highly recommend this to anybody!!!"
5.0,It Works!!!,"The first time I used this stuff, it didn't work, or I just didn't produce that much milk. I stopped using it for like a week or 2, then tried it again. The second time I tried it, I felt my breast filling up within 2 hours....they even leaked. THEY NEVER LEAK, unless I go a whole day without pumping or feeding. I had fed my daughter around 6, before I came to work. I drank the tea around 830, and I was leaking around 10.  The downside to using this (for me) is that my daughter is allergic to fenugreek. Whenever I used the pills(which didn't work), she got bumps on her neck, arms, legs, and a little bit on her eyelids. Then after I started using the tea, the same thing happened. Then I stopped using the tea, they went away. Then came back after I used it again.  I really wish my daughter didn't get bumps from fenugreek, because this would be the perfect product for me to make more milk. I hope it works for you and your baby. But I don't like her with bumps this way.  ='-("
5.0,Perfect for the Office or On the Go,This creamer can turn an ordinary cup of coffee into a Hazelnut Latte.  And it comes in portable cups that don't need to be refrigerated so they're perfect to keep in my desk at work or in the car for road trips.  I like two cups per mug of coffee for an even richer flavor.
5.0,Great product,Love the tea and this is the only place I have been able to find gallon size tea bags. We make sun tea all year long.
5.0,Wonderful.......,"Brought this as a gift, the receiver is still chuckling, and uses it on everything."
1.0,Salty!,"I was hoping for something similar to Jacks, which is my favorite. It is a little thinner than most, with smaller bits of tomatoes and cilantro, the way I like it. However, this was so salty I couldn't eat more than two bites. I poured it down the drain."
1.0,Never again.,"I had wanted to try this -- not because of the low acid, but because Puroast was always in the health food section, pricey, and I drink mostly decaf.  I figured if it was by the Newman's Own, it might be pretty good, and as primarily a decaf drinker, finding brands that are decent is an ongoing thing.  It was on sale at the grocery store, and I also had a Kroger coupon, which priced it to a little over $5.  Wow, what a disappointment.  It smelled and tasted like cheap alcohol -- rank and chemically tasting.  I will e-mail the company to see if I can get a refund if I send my receipt in.  This stuff was awful and I'll never buy it again!"
5.0,Customer Service Wonderful,I hadn't received the product but was contacted by the customer service department and spoke with a lovely young woman who is re-sending it and I should have it by Tuesday.  This product has become quite popular as it was an ingredient featured in mung bean soup which was on a show of Dr. Oz.  They said they had 22 orders just today.  Four stars from me for customer service.
5.0,I smile in the mornings now,"If you enjoy smooth, strong, DELICIOUSNESS, please please please don't waste your time with other Keurig K-cups. I've tried a huge variety of them, and many of them taste harsh, acidic, and straight out of 7-11 (I'm looking at you, Green Mountain). This coffee has a rich flavor with a hint of sweetness and none of the bitterness going down. I could not recommend it more. This morning I felt compelled to write a review on these simply because I woke up actually looking forward to drinking Tully's Italian Roast vs sleeping in. Italian Roast got me out of bed, folks, and that's hard to do on a Thursday at 6AM."
5.0,Dough enhances,I have to follow a Gluten Free diet so I purchased this to help with baked items. I really don't see a difference.
1.0,I'd rather make this combination myself,"I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely."
5.0,Many Uses,"Better Than Bullion - Mushroom makes a flavorful rub for vegetables and meats that you are roasting. All by itself, or with the usual herbs you use in dry rub. Just remember, this stock is salted. It can enrich salad dressings too. Use it as you would an herb to season all sorts of dishes. *Instead of salt: Substitute 1 Tbs Better Than Bouillon(tm) for 1 tsp salt. *For reduced-fat wok cooking: Substitute ratio of 2 tsp Better Than Bouillon(tm) per cup water for the oil. *For simple gravies: Make a roux of 2 Tbs flour and 2 Tbs butter; add 2 cups broth (2 tsp Better Than Bouillon(tm) Base dissolved in 2 cups hot water). Add meat juices if available. Season with pepper to taste. *For a magnificent homestyle meatloaf: Add 1 rounded tsp Better Than Bouillon(tm) Beef(or Mushroom)Base for each pound of your favorite meatloaf recipe. Simply dissolve Better Than Bouillon(tm) Base into the egg mixture during preparation. Note: Better Than Bouillon(tm) replaces the salt! *For world champion chicken patties and chicken balls: Add 1 rounded tsp Better Than Bouillon(tm) Chicken Base to each pound of your outdoor barbecue chicken burgers or Italian chicken meatballs. Dissolve Better Than Bouillon(tm) Chicken Base into the water and egg mixture during preparation. *For McDonald's flavored french fries: Soak raw, sliced potatoes in 2 Tbs Better Than Bouillon(tm) Beef Base dissolved in 2 qts chilled water overnight. Be sure to dry potatoes thoroughly before frying. The BTB website has more recipes. When I placed an order for 8 jars (there are lots of flavors) they sent a cookbook free."
5.0,One of the best if not the best instant noodles I've ever had.,My favorite recipe: boil half water half chicken broth. Add green onions and Kimchi. then just enough of the spice packet for flavor. Add noodles. once noodles are almost cooked add two large eggs. once you're done drink soup or have it with rice.
5.0,Excellent,Our dog goes crazy over these!!  These truly are wonderful & work great for those of you who's pet has a sensitive stomach. Gina
1.0,Did not like...,"I had heard so many good things about using this in place of wheat (white) pasta.  For me, it did not do it.  Now, I did not cook it as I eat raw foods.  I soaked it overnight and rinsed it well, but it did not have the same texture as al dente pasta.  I tried to warm it a bit in my dehydrator which made it harden very quickly.  This means I would always have to eat it cold if I did not cook it.  I did not like it.  As far as the fishiness, though, that some may be concerned about.  I did not find it fishy at all and I am not a huge fan of sea veggies.  It was very mild.  I think it is worth ""trying"" if you are a raw vegan/vegetarian because you may like it.  I just wish I did."
1.0,"Well, bluntly put.","If you are a fan of peppered beef jerky then you are probably not looking for something sweet. More likely you prefer something spicy.  This is not it. I think this is one of the worst tasting peppered beef jerky i have tried. Way to sweet, but if that is what you are looking for, then go for it. Ok, I hated that beef jerky. It was gross. I dont think you will like it. I dont reccomend buying it . Enough said."
1.0,dissapointed in order,I have placed two orders for the weber grill grinder roasted garlic herb in the past.  I was so disappointing the last time I picked up my order as it was not what I had ordered.  It was citrus twist with garlic.  I just love the garlic and herb grinder and have given my first order away to my family as Christmas gifts.  I now don't even have one bottle for myself.  You can see I have reordered the garlic herb and hope I will receive what I have ordered.  It would be so inconvenient to repackage and return.  If it was possible to buy it in my location I would but it's not available.  Very Disappointed  Leona  The order that I received with the citus garlic was as follows.

5.0,Love this Coconut Water,I love this coconut water and it's soothing to the GI system as well. I find that drinking one of these with my coffee in the morning helps me start the day right!
1.0,Waste of money,"I was so excited to try Zevia for the first time and this is the flavor I picked up. It's really gross. It has a taste similar to something bitter--except worse. Plus, it's so expensive for its bad taste...and it's not like it has nutrients in it. I wouldn't repurchase this if it was free. Just drink sparkling water."
1.0,THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ORDER,You will get the plain MALT and amazon will not fix it.  So I'm returning mine to Walmart.  There is a huge difference in taste btwn that malt and chocolate malt.  DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT CHOCOLATE MALT!!!
5.0,great for the skin,i bought this because i was looking for something that would help dry skin. this is the best stuff i have ever used and it softens skin very quickly. i will definately stick with this for my skin. works great for dry hair too.
1.0,Hydrogenated Oil = Trans Fat = VERY BAD!!!,Foods using hydrogenated oils should come with an add-on Defibrillator.  However these trans fat cookies might taste ... they can't be worth a clogged artery.
5.0,Love at first bite,"Our Boston Terrier was rescued so we are not certain of his exact age.  We do know that after enriching our lives for the past 11 years, he has slowed down considerably with a lot of graying.  We are mixing the Natural Balance with his dry food in the morning.  If the amount of speed a dog can digest food is a measure of how much they like their food, then Natural Balance is a big hit with our Lucky.  The ingredients are excellent.  He's at an age where training is no longer a concern; we just want to pamper him in a healthy way."
5.0,Absolutely wonderful!,"This is fantastic lime marmalade with a delicious flavor.  It's great on toast, makes an amazing PB&J, and is also a terrific addition when making Asian dipping sauces.  I always keep some on hand for when I need to add a ""sweet-tart"" flavor to recipes.  I wish I could find it locally, but it's great to be able to get it through Amazon."
1.0,Tastes awful,Not only is the canister only 1/3 full but this tastes so horrible. My very un-fussy 4 year old literally spat it out. Thinking maybe she was being fussy I tried it myself and the sickly sweet taste is just vile. I use Vitality Supergreens and Dr Schultz's for myself and hoped to find a product that would be just as beneficial but tasty enough for a child - well this is definitely not it. Massive waste of money.
1.0,I haven't received it yet.,"I have been waiting. This usually arrives on time and is a godsend, because when my cat runs out --oh, it's awful!! Guess I have to run to the store."
1.0,Made in China,"Be forewarned.  This product is from China and I returned it because of the past problems with food from China.  This is not stated in the product discription.  J.T. California Ovaltine Malt Beverage Mix, 14-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4) "
1.0,no flavor,"Was very disappointed, there was no real cheese flavor. Had to add our own extra sharp cheddar to give it pop. Also, cheese sauce didn't cover the noodles well."
1.0,Couldn't get it down...,"Drinking it once was bad enough, I'm sure I couldn't get it down ever again.  I wish I could drink it for the nutritional value, but may try the capsules instead."
1.0,"Used to be good, now they are terrible","I've been buying these cherries for years, and they used to be absolutely wonderful.  They had just the right amount of tartness, not too much sweetness, etc.  I don't know what they've done (I even tried to contact the company regarding my complaint - they didn't respond), but they are now really bad.  They are overly sweet, and taste like the cherries are ""bad"".  I even tried buying the cherries at two different places, same result, terrible.  I won't be buying these again."
1.0,The Worst!,"I just finished eating two of these, and I can say that they really are awful. The worst part has to be the coating. It is nothing like the chocolate covered Oreo's that usually come out at Christmas. You can tell from just looking at them that they are cheaply made. I believe that the coating is made from palm oil, as the package states that it is in them. This stuff not only tastes greasy and bad, but it also sits on your stomach the same way. Adults won't enjoy this, unless you have a cast iron stomach that can digest grease. Save your money, maybe this is a good time for us all to eat fruit instead.  (ps: you only get a thin, very thin Oreo. So thin, that I really wasn't even sure it was an Oreo.  Update: Last week I was at a discount store and the manager came on the speakers and said they were selling ""fudge covered Oreos for .$50 a pack."" So I hurried to the front, and to my disappointment it was these things. I thought they were having the real fudge covered Oreos like you get around Christmas. I told the manager about my review on Amazon. No one was buying these things as I'm sure they had tried them before. I felt that the manager anticipated them flying off the shelves. They were still there when I checked out!"
5.0,Best bottled sauce I've ever had!,"My husband and I have been making our own sauce for years because bottled sauces are so lame, but we think the alla vodka pasta sauce is fabulous.  It was being sampled at a grocery store so I tried it and I couldn't believe how much flavor it has.  Try it--you'll like it!"
1.0,Pump works poorly.,This pump did not work well.  Plus it made the bottle with the pump too tall to fit in either of my two fridges.  I gave up and ended up just throwing it away.
5.0,Wonderful product!,I try to avoid all sugars but need something to sweeten up my coffee in the morning. This product is perfect for that. You don't need to use very much to sweeten up your beverage. The container is very practical and easy to pour. I am very happy that this product is organic. I am very pleased with this purchase and will continue to order it and use it.
5.0,not just for coffee.  TEA lovers will love it too.,but be aware.  It is addictive.  I love this stuff in anything from beverages to my instant oatmeal.  Try it and you will agree. And by signing up for scheduled delivery I am never without it in the house
5.0,Madagascar Vanilla Beans,Freshness is very important especially when you using this product for cooking. The Beans will give the homemade vanilla extract the flavor my recipes require.
5.0,Best substitute for sugar yet!,"We've tried them all, artificial and natural. This is the by far the best!  Just wish I could get it in a bigger bag!  You don't even realize you're not eating/drinking sugar.  Made great muffins, iced tea, coffee, and even brownies!"
1.0,Not their best.,Make your own rice and use the Eden bean of your choice for a better dinner.  The canned beans are great.
1.0,Smelled like windex,"My husband bought these thinking they looked good,We got them home, made them and the smell was awful. well we decided to taste them anyway BIG MISTAKE! They tasted worse then they smelled! Upon further consideration, we decided to not feed it to the dogs. We wouldn't want them to get sick... we love our dogs."
1.0,Wisconsin Cheddar? Tastes More Like Salt,"I can't eat these. All I taste is the salt, and so threw most of them in the trash. They are slandering Wisconsin, Wisconsin cheddar, and cheddar cheeses in general."
1.0,Where's the Mocha?,"I have given all positive reviews for K-cup flavors except this one, where's the mocha?  Doesn't smell or taste like mocha, not sure what they were going for here but Mocha doesn't seem to be it.  It's not even really that good a cup of coffee, whatever they added in to try and be mocha just adds some bitterness and not much else.  I tried to drink them but ended up tossing most of them away.  Too spoiled by so many other good flavors to waste time drinking this one.  Best Timothy's flavor is their Rainforest Espresso, oh wow that's good, and best flavored k-cup overall is Green Mountain Caramel Vanilla, you haven't lived until you've tried that one.  This Mocha, ehhhh, keep looking."
5.0,"A little pricey, but worth the $","Our full sized Goldendoodle gets one every day.  According to our vet, his teeth and gums ""look great"".  I also have purchased the feline greenies for my daughter when she complained that hr cat had ""bad breath"".  3 chews/3 days later=no more bad breath."
1.0,RETRO CANDY 1960'S,"THE CANDY WAS OF POOR QUALITY AND TASTE.  WOULD NEVER ORDER IT AGAIN.  THE ONLY THING THAT WAS SATISFACTORY WAS THE NICE GIFT BOX THE CANDY WAS WRAPPED IN.  OTHERWISE, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT."
5.0,love this product - don't stop making!,I love this product and can't find it in local stores.  Im thrilled I can order it on line and have nothing but good stuff to say about it.
1.0,"Eh, they were ok.",Kinda bland in flavor.  The crisp of the shell and the crunch of the peanut was spot on but the taste left much to the imagination.
1.0,Burned beans make for bitter espresso,"This ""roast"" is absolutely horrible. My first thought upon opening the bag and smelling the beans was, ""Akk! These smell like charcoal!""  These beans are not simply dark roasted - they're completely burned. Dreading the results, I attempted to pull a few shots on the espresso machine, There was virtually no crema and the espresso itself was bitter and disgusting. I've tasted better espresso pulled from 6 month old ESE pods! Maybe these beans work better for regular coffee in a percolator machine with a fine paper filter to keep the charcoal out of the decanter; for espresso, they're a horrid failure."
5.0,Value deal*****,Shop around for prices! These Olives are a bargain for the price. (they are from Israel) Brine is the usual vinegar type.
5.0,Not just for kids,"I love these Easy Mac cups.  I have a disability that requires me to get around in a wheelchair, and it is difficult for me to use the stove.  This product being microwavable makes it really easy for me to use.  And it tastes really good, too."
1.0,Error on price of dog food,"I ordered this as it is the food I always use and pay $52 for the large bag, didn't realize I was getting the small 4.4 lb bag.  This is not a deal.  It is higher than I pay at the pet store!"
5.0,Delicious fruity jam that is good year round.,"I first bought this as a take home token when visiting the east coast. I fell in love with this jam and I am normally a jelly person, preferring to not have ""chunks"" in my spread.  This jam changed my mind with it's unique flavor and combination of fruits.  I love it and the smaller jar ensures that I have enough without wasting and I like to have it available year round in our pantry."
1.0,dont buy it,"Walden Farms makes some good products but this is not one. It is downright horrible. I am not picky, this stuff looks great but tastes like chemicals."
1.0,icky,We love garden of eatin.  These are just icky.  I love tamari but these don't taste good.
5.0,Food-allergy friendly!,Absolutely fantastic. One of the few foods my milk-egg-and-peanut-allergic child craves. Thank you for giving me an option!
1.0,More Qestions Than Answers,"Great bergamot aroma, but unacceptable bitterness. , My question is this real bergamot oil used in the process or just an artificial substitute? Usually when the natural oil is used it states so. This tea only list bergamot ""flavor"" as the ingredient. This is usually a clever ""legal"" way of cheating on customers.Second, like some others have written, I also noticed a harsh bitter aftertaste when brewed past 5 minutes. Thats not very long and one shouldn't have to put a stop watch to a cup of tea! Maybe an artificial bergamot makes it bitter? I've been searching for a replacement  for an old favorite.Best Earl Grey ever was Williamson & Magor, but sadly the company is no longer solvent after a 100 plus years. They used genuine bergamot ""oil"" and it was phenominal! Dimah's tin caddy is fantastic and should be an industry standard!  Update: Taylors of Harrogate Earl Grey Leaf Tea, Loose Leaf, is awesome!!! Beats this bitter Dilmah impostor like a rented mule. Taylors of Harrogate is even better than my old favorite and uses ""REAL"" oil of Bergamot."
1.0,Orville made a big mistake,"I consider Redenbacher to be the absolute #1 microwave popcorn. However, they should be ashamed of this stuff.  It's terrible.  Doesn't taste like cheese at all.  Just tastes super salty and has a fake color that looks like they put too much food color on it.  I'll never buy this flavor again."
1.0,Not for dogs with food allergies,"I have a dog with all kinds of allergies. She loves sweet potato treats and I love giving them to her because they're so healthy (the more I read about all the dangers of processed treats found in pet stores, the more resolute I am in my decision to never, ever feed her that garbage).  The only problem I have with these treats is that they contain eggs and salt in addition to the natural sweet potato and probiotics. Eggs are a big no-no for any dog with food allergies, and salt is just something you shouldn't really be feeding your dog anyway. At least not in excessive quantities. These treats are a thousand times better than regular dog treats, but they didn't work for my dog.  I've decided to stick to Snook's sweet potato treats. They're 100% dried sweet potato and nothing else - also made in the USA and my dog absolutely loves them."
1.0,Never Received,"Was very sad to never receive the much needed filters! Not able to really track package with tracking number, just wanted what was paid for, what a hassle for $9."
1.0,Bad chocolate,"I received this product faster than anticipated which was the only plus to the product.  The chocolate was old, crumbly and already turning white. A business partner of mine had recommended this chocolate, but I will have to wait to try it now."
5.0,Excellent product!,"I ordered this for the first time recently and found it awesome! I made a perfect vegetable curry, very flavorful and spicy. I'm going to make up another batch over the weekend, and put this curry paste on my list to order again."
5.0,"Tasty, crunchy cereal.","This is really tasty delicious cereal.  The flakes have a slightly sweet flavor that is off-set by the slight tartness of the natural huge slices of dehydrated berries.  I would give a word of warning though, the flakes are VERY crunchy, which may be an issue if you have dental problems.  I think they are great because they don't get soggy quick in the milk.  My 6-year-old loves it too.  For those of you who automatically think that the word ""Kashi"" means sawdust (like a few of my friends who I have had to retrain), you can get that notion out of your head because there is no gritty, grainy texture to this, just nice crunchy flakes."
5.0,"Green is milder than Black, and both are great.","Green peppercorns are best used whole (while cooking) or in a pepper grinder. They can be used in the same places you'd use black pepper, but are milder and more aromatic. They have less bite than black pepper.  I was very pleased with these peppercorns.  I'd order them again."
5.0,Great gummies!,"Omg, I found these great gummies in carrollton, and they are tasty, juicy and addicting!!! Try them out! I will reorder soon!"
5.0,"Quick, easy, and tasty.",I have loved this as an easy way to flavor up steak. You put this on. Then tenderize with a fork. Let site for an hour or two. Soak the steaks with Lea & Perrins Worcestershire. Let sit another hour and then off to the grill. The things which makes this 5 star is the insane savings over the grocery store price for the little 3.1oz bottles they carry. I got 96 ounces for the price of ~21 ounces at the grocery.
1.0,Repulsive,"I love sunflower seeds, and I agree with the other two low reviews that these seeds are raunchy...but not in a good way. I gave just one seed to a colleague and he responded that ""it wasn't a pleasant experience."" They taste like they've been washed in Dial soap, which is emphasized and highlighted by the jalepe&ntilde;o flavoring.  I know this because I've had my mouth washed out before as a kid.  The David Buffalo Ranch flavored seeds also have that strange and repulsive chemical taste, but not as pronounced as these hot flavored ones.  Stick to the Frito Lay seeds. They might not be jumbo, but they don't taste like they were made in Detroit.  P.S. baseball players chew too, but that don't make it appropriate, or a baseball player an authority by any stretch of the imagination. But good for you, you baseball player you."
5.0,About as good as bagged Starbucks can be made with a Mr Coffee,"We don't have your fancy schmancy coffee makers. We just have the basic, Mr Coffee with a 12-cup carafe. It's really impossible to duplicate the flavor you get at the coffee bars when basic home equipment. That said, this coffee emerged full, rich, strong and most importantly, without that nauseating taste some flavored coffees have. My daughter and I are both coffee lovers and were both pleased."
5.0,The best!,"I use this regularly. It has a great flavor and when ordered through Amazon, it is usually less expensive than purchasing in a grocery store. A good bargain with great taste."
5.0,Beyond Hot Mocha Cocoa,"Try a little sprinkle on ice cream, makes a good milkshake, mix it in cakes or brownies, sprinkle on the cake, enhance coffee drinks and liquors, get rid of that pesky cat, add texture to Barry and Levon's 240 pounds of pudding, brown paper mache, movie prop heroin, or dip your bananas in it.  I consume it with BlueBell Homemade Vanilla ice cream.  I like the double chocolate better."
5.0,Good Snack,"These are light, not too sweet, very crunchy, just enough chocolate flavor to keep them interesting to your taste buds."
5.0,"Great Quality, Great Price","Everyone seems to be catching on to the healthy benefits of coconut oil.  I use it for cooking, drop a plop into a smoothie, use it on my skin and hair...all great so I won't revisit all of that.  This product specifically is a very high quality and the price on Amazon is phenomenal. It arrived promptly and in good condition.  Nature's Way sells some great products.  This is no exception."
1.0,"Really, really sandy","I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it."
5.0,Amazon - make this one a subscribe and save item please!,"I am a big fan of smoothies and living in Florida, i get lots of weather calling for something cold and refreshing. I now put this in my banana smoothies and LOVE it!! Amazon, please please make this a subscribe and save item....P.S. i also added it to an Indian recipe and it was perfect!"
1.0,food items are not returnable- be careful what you order,"These matzo crackers were in poor shape when they arrived.  The dark chocolate had a white covering which generally means it got too hot or too cold.  I did try one of the crackers- stale, stale, stale.  So, now I have three boxes (minus one cracker) of inedible crackers sitting on my counter because I can't bring myself to throw away $17.77 worth of my wasted money.  They are not returnable per the website; I was going to try to return them but no luck.  As for this review, it did get one star because the system won't take the message without at least one star."
5.0,Great service,"I get this product since where I live there is no place to buy it,. product is original, great condition, fast service."
1.0,Wise Cheez Waffies,This is the item I remember from 60's. However I do not remember the retailer marking over the old price with a magic marker and charging a price close to double what it was originally.  This was kinda disappointing for a product coming from Amazon warehouse and will definitely preclude me from ordering again.
1.0,Ripped Off,"I always buy this oatmeal from Amazon. 4 cans for around $23. When I went to reorder, Amazon redirected me to another vendor. I did not notice the trap I had fallen into. I thouht I was getting 4 cans as always. I ended up getting 1 can for $17. This is a ridiculous price for one can of oatmeal !"
5.0,Great add to chili or anything,"I made a recipe for chili that uses salsa, fire-roasted tomatoes, ground turkey, red wine, tumeric, garlic and a large dose of Sweet Mesquite.  I have always gotten complements and have even won top prize in a chili contest at work.  The unique flavor of this particular spice mix makes all the difference.  I have used it in other recipes and have given this as gifts.  The recipients rave and use it in their own special recipes with great results.  Worth a try if you like smoky flavors with a bit of sass"
1.0,jacobs coffee,i have bought this coffee several times in the past and it was great. this time there was just no coffee taste to it at all and it was a hundred years old. very disappointing.
1.0,"Bad, Old, Products...","This product that I recieved was old... My dogs turned their nose up at it... My dogs really love this when they are fresh... These must have been over 1 yr old... I can't believe that Amazon had sold these... Bad, Old, Products..."
1.0,Sickly sweet,The bars are smaller than I thought and that's good because they taste as if you're eating a bar of solid sugar. Each bar contains 2 grams of protein but seven grams of sugar!!! I hope no one's feeding these to children!
5.0,My Best Days!,"I am a very busy person and drink the Trivedi Water to keep up my pace and clarity of mind.  From this water, I get a pleasant pick up and feel my best.  The energy is not a temporary buzz, but a lift which lasts. I feel I have an edge over the average worker on getting more done, and also experience greater digestion and health as well. A bottle a day, adds all this to my life!"
5.0,Best cornbread EVER,"I've been searching for a long time for a good cornbread.  Bought this on a whim.  It is DELICIOUS!  It turns out moist, sweet (but not overly), light, and yummy!  I'm not even much of a cook and this always turns out perfect!  You just mix in 1 egg, milk, and oil and bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes in an 8x8x2 greased pan.  I can't say enough good about this product!"
1.0,I thought they were great until I learned about menadione sodium bisulfite,"Thanks to another reviewer, I learned today that Greenies contain a synthetic, controversial ingredient, menadione sodium bisulfite (MSB), that is highly questionable and considered by many experts to be toxic. I will no longer take that chance with my pet just because the FDA hasn't gotten around to banning it. Based upon the information I have read about it, the only apparent reason to add MSB to pet food is to claim it as a nutritious ingredient, namely, the k-vitamins that come from green plants. In other words, the basis of ""Greenies"" is a cheap synthetic version of the real thing. That must be why the ingredient label describes the stuff as ""source of vitamin k activity.""  Furthermore, although my 3 year-old cat has been eating between 6-12 Greenies every day, he is currently in need of advanced dental work. I see no evidence that these so-called dental treats are effective and they may very well be harmful."
1.0,8 days to deliver w/prime ?,This gum took 8 days even with amoazon prime thats too long will never order from this site again.8 days ?
5.0,Love it!,This stuff is the best ever for seasoning everything....use it for blackening as well as cajun honey mustard....cajun mashed potatoes....just about everything! Save mad cash by buying in bulk!
5.0,excellent for cooking and skin!,"I just bought this a couple weeks back as a gift for mydad whose a health nut, I bought myself a jar too. I use a small spoonfull in a pan every morning for my scramble eggs, also to fry potatoes. No taste at all of coconut, although I'm going to try some someday that might have a hint of it as I love coconut :) I also rub a tad on my hands too while I have it out for cooking and it's lovely. I've dne a lot of research on the net of the benefits of coconut oil and they surpass most all other oils...but beware because there are a LOT of opinions out there. I love it, check it out."
5.0,Store a bunch of K-Cups and get rid of the boxes!,"These drawers look great in the office.  There is a little lip on the top of the drawer so they can stack or you can put more K-Cups.  Looks so much better than boxes!  Invert every other K-Cup and it will hold 63 K-Cups.  The drawers pull out smoothly & evenly (it might need a bit of wax after a while).  The drawers have a nice little stop to prevent the drawers from falling out accidentally (nice little plus that).  It is kind of long so it might not fit into some cabinets.  If you were wondering about this well, just get it.  We are thinking about getting another one.  Great product, accurate shipping, worth the money.  Thanks!"
1.0,Buyer Beware,"Kombucha is traditionally a combination of bacteria and yeast that is theoretically supposed to help balance the flora in your intestinal tract.  While Yogi teas tea box does not make these claims, they also fail to tell buyers that their Kombucha tea contains both bacteria and yeast.  They claim that the strains of bacteria and yeast are safe, however they stated to me that their product contains Brewer's yeast which is known to aggravate even cause yeast infections in those prone to systemic yeast infections.  They claim that the yeast is killed in the Brewing process, but one can not be sure of this and if you are prone to systemic yeast infections, I would highly recommend that you avoid this product.  They have already had one law suit filed against them by a woman who is convinced that their product caused her yeast infection."
5.0,Just May Be My Favorite So Far!,"I think that the review I wrote for this somehow got lost somewhere in cyberspace, so I am writing another.  If the other one manages to find its way back, forgive me for having two reviews on the same tea!  This is an awesome Matcha, if it isn't my favorite flavored Matcha thus far, then it is definitely my favorite pear tea thus far.  The pear flavor is very true to the fruit - authentic tasting and very strong.  It tastes so much like pear that I can almost feel the pulpy texture of the pear as I sip this!  An excellent Matcha.  If you're wondering where to start with Matcha, I'd recommend this one.  So good.  So very, very good!  (Oh, the caramel one is good too!)"
5.0,Yummy!!,"We all love this chocolate spread. It is creamy, smooth, absolutely DELICIOUS and vegan. No dairy or animal-derived products in it. I wouldn't buy anything else. It is not overly sweet and if you have a chocolate craving, it is most satisfying."
1.0,I actually love this product - but what a mistake I made - size!!!,"I truly love Bassett's JBs!!!!  If you buy them, and you love sweet jelly candy - you'll love these guys!  However, I bought the item thinking the package was the bag about 3 times this size - mistake.  This package is 215g which weighs 1/2 pound.  $20 for a pound of these is a complete rip!!!!  This item actually sells for about $3 in stores where you can find this English treat.  Be careful - unlike me."
5.0,Buy it at Kroger for $3.79!,"This is the best. My husband is a chef at a national hotel chain and he uses this all the time.  We call it crack in a bottle, because it's as addictive as crack!  Do yourself a favor though and go to Kroger where it only costs $3.79 for the same size bottle!"
1.0,Seeds no good!,"The planter is nice but the seeds are no good!  They didn't grow too much at all, just a few sprouts.  I want my money back!"
1.0,Not Worth The Money!,I'm very familiar with this coffee and I really like it. But the coffee that I was sent was very old and was a total rip-off! If you read the other reviews they thought it was great but apparently I was sent coffee from the same batch 18 months later. The coffee is old and not worth the money anymore. I was cheated!
1.0,product not vegan,"when I received this product I discovered that it contains calcium sterate, which is made from animals. This should have been made clear before I ordered the product."
1.0,garbage,"My dog, like all dogs, will eat anything. But my pooch would NOT eat this crap. Smart boy he is. It has onions in it which is toxic to canines. And plus it has this rubbery texture and doesn't seem like. Real ""beef"" at all. Waste of money I tell you."
1.0,SALT CITY,I had purchased salmon jerky at a fish market in the past and had hope that this product would be good. The salmon jerky was so salty that I had to toss it in the garbage.
1.0,Don't waste your time!,"I thought I was ordering a variety of colors. When I opened the box I had 60 rainbow swirl pops. Don't get me wrong, I love the look of the rainbow ones, but was extremely disappointed after unpacking all 60 pops to find that their was no variety. Now I have to deal with returning them and reordering from a DIFFERENT vendor. On a positive note, None of the pops were broken. Shop elsewhere if color and variety are important to you!!!!"
1.0,Hot spots galore while on Canidae,"I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing."
5.0,A hit at home and work!,"These are a fantastic low-fat snack for home, school, and work. If you love Buffalo Wings you will love these!"
5.0,Great tasting veggies,Adding pear for natural sweetness makes the two green veggies go down so much easier.  Really yummy.  Happybaby Happy Tots - Green Beans Pears and Peas Organic Baby Super Food for Kids - 4.22 Oz pouch 
1.0,TOTAL BS,"IT HAS BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE I WAS SUPPOSED TO RECEIVE MY MERCHANDISE! RIDICULOUS! THE ONLY CONTACT THERE IS, IS THE SHIPPING COMPANY. THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL OR DIRECT E-MAIL FOR AMAZON... I HAVE NEVER AND I MEAN NEVER HAD AN ISSUE RECEIVING MY MERCHANDISE IN THE TIME THAT WAS ALLOTTED ON THE SHIPPING WEBSITE. THE FACT THAT THE SHIPPING MAGICALLY STOPPED AFTER IT LEFT THE SHIPPING FACILITY IS BESIDE ME. I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH SOMEONE WHO CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE OTHER THAN LEAVING A NASTY REVIEW! I AM NOT ONLY INSULTED BY THIS PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND WHERE MY STUFF IS BUT AM COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT AMAZON.COM WOULD NOT GIVE THE DECENCY OR HAVE THE COURTESY TO GIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS AN OPTION TO CALL!!! I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN TRUST USING AMAZON AS A SELLER ANYMORE, IF I CONTINUE TO PURCHASE FROM THIS SITE IT WILL BE THROUGH OUTSIDE SELLERS... NOT AMAZON!!! (THE ONE STAR ISN'T FOR THE PRODUCT IT'S FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS INABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS)"
5.0,Amazing!,This thing is amazing! This is the closest I could the to Starbuck's White Chocolate Mocha. I bought it directly online from the Starbucks Store and it's relatively cheaper.
5.0,Super-fantastic yaki-soba packs,"Now that I know I can get these from Amazon, I won't have to special order them through my grocer.  I used to live in Japan, and I really enjoyed yaki-soba (Japanese noodles) when I lived there.  BTW - these ARE NOT ramen.  These have Ramen-like noodles, but the powder is yaki-soba flavored, and when you cook them the right way you end up with a flavored noodle, not a soup.  I like to add peas and meat...ham is best.  You can add other things, as well, but this is my lunch of choice when I am home on weekends.  Believe it or not, these noodles capture the lion's share of flavor of the yaki soba shops and street vendors I used to frequent when I lived in Japan.  5 yummy stars!  Just make sure that you follow the directions that come on the back for best results!"
5.0,great service,"Got seeds fast. Didn't really have instructions but thats ok, I put them in my sprouter like other seeds and they did find, made good size sprouts in about 5 days. Tried them in dirt also and that worked great, but was a little messier to harvest. Great value, and sunflower sprouts are so good!"
1.0,UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER,BOX WAS SMASHED AND THE DONUTS WERE ALL STICKY AND MELTED ICING ALL OVER THE BOX... WORSE BUY TO MAKE FOR THE SUMMERTIME.. I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON ON MAKING THIS MY OWN PERSONAL IMPULSE BUY...  NEVER GOING TO BUY THIS ITEM AGAIN...
1.0,bag was greasy,It was a real pain to throw out the whole bag.....but it was too disgusting to open.... beware. I am a huge fan of Kirkland products-but this was not worth opening to try.  My local Costco doesn't sell this.
5.0,great quality at a good price -- and so happy that I found this!,"I had been searching far and wide for canned pumpkin, but to no avail until I came across this product.  Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this brand before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.  The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.  The taste is just right to me -- pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its brand name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.  My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods. This was my first experience with this product, but I assure you, it will not be my last!"
1.0,Gross,This tastes terrible. I am used to having a flavored protein and the strong flavor is really gross and hard to mask. I wasted $25. :/
5.0,Yummy goodness,Bought this product in a grocery chain and was very expensive.  But the taste is so delicious!  Glad to find it online at a reduced price.
5.0,C.E.T. Chews for petite dogs.,"My Chihuhuas love them, I break one in two and give to them everyday. They start dancing when I ask them if they want a chew stick."
5.0,yum,This is the only red curry paste that my wife and I have found that is suitably flavorful and spicy. Highly recommended.
5.0,Great Flavor Even fooled meat eaters,"Based on reviews online for vegan snacks, I tried this particular flavor and love them. Great snack for the road. They are mostly Wheat gluten in case you want to limit your soy intake. My friends who eat animals loved them also. I didn't mention what they were made of until they were finished eating them and asked. Nice chewy texture. These travel well. They have 10 Gms of protein in case you are asked ""where do you get your protein?"" I plan on trying another flvor."
5.0,Yummy,"Delicious and best thing ever. Nice spice has a little kick! If you love grilled artichokes, ignore review that stated the product was stale. They are packed in SUNFLOWER oil not OLIVE oil, hence the different taste..."
1.0,"Tastes like the tin, not recomended.",Theses were terrible!  I don't know if it was because they were stale or anything like that.  They were really oily too.  I would not ever buy these again.
1.0,very bad taste.,"This was the worst coffee Lavazza Gold Selection Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag  I have tried.  Bitter, nasty taste."
5.0,Delicious Tea with a Kick,"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage is a delicious and satisfying hot tea that reminds me a lot of those gummy, crystal, sweetened, ginger snacks.  The aroma is mostly lemon with a decent whiff of ginger.  The taste is dominated by ginger with a subtle lemon flavor and a bit of honey.  The sweetness and tartness are just enough to lend a terrific complement of flavor.  The palate feels smooth, with a medium-light body and HUGE ginger burn on the back of the throat.  While ginger and lemon aren't among my favorite flavors, I really loved this tea and would recommend it to any tea drinker, but especially those who love ginger.  I also tried this tea as an iced tea, but since it has no bitterness and only a mild sweetness, the flavors fell flat when cold.  The ginger is much less noticeable when cold as well.  If you add some black tea and/or sugar, it might work out better as an iced tea, but my recommendation is to drink it hot."
1.0,Cracked up!!!!,They was all cracked up so I put them in the trash I did not want to send it back cause it was useless
1.0,So Many Problems,"The first problem I had with these candies is that they arrived clearly worse for wear. They had been exposed to heat at some point, and having been packaged and shipped in an envelope that at some point was beaten by a monkey or perhaps a small cranky child, the candies were warped and lumpy and partially out of their wrappings. The second issue was with taste - they were unbearably sweet, the ""coconut creme"" filling had almost no coconut flavor and was cloying and unpleasant. There was very little difference in taste between the chocolate and the ""coconut creme"" filling. The third problem was with texture. The chocolate coating was waxy and thick and lacked the crisp snap of a properly tempered chocolate, and the ""creme"" filling was chalky, heavy, and not creamy at all. I found them to be inedible."
5.0,LOVE KENYA AA K-CUPS!  ONE OF THE BEST!,"Excellent, simple cup of morning coffee that is not bitter nor truly extra bold as advertised.  I consider it to be a medium roast/breakfast blend kind of coffee.  If you are into heavy, dark roasts like French, Italian, or Sumatran, then the Kenya AA may be fairly mild for your taste.  However, I love it.  Unfortunately, the one-star review is an angry comment regarding price and has nothing to do with the quality of the coffee."
5.0,Tiny candy canes just right,"I ordered 4 boxes of these little candy canes for 4 Santa visits to our libraries. We gave them all out - which means we had over 1000 people sit on Santa's lap! They are the little size which is perfect since kids rarely eat a whole candy cane. Shipping was on time. Candy canes are tasty, too!"
5.0,Thai Teas,"Bought this tea for my daughter, she loved it. Said ,""yes, finally an original restaurant thai tea"". Not the anise tasting teas that claim to be restaurant style tea. Yes, I will remember and buy again .Love Thai restarants especially for the tea."
5.0,This is the Postum I never thought I'd find.  Smooth and Tasty,"This is the product I thought I had lost....It's slightly lighter than Postum, but you can compensate with adding a little more.  1% milk and sweet and low makes a delicious breakfast drink.  I am hooked...and glad of it."
1.0,"no taste, a mess",I usually order the unsweetened flaked coconut and it's fantastic. I saw that this was twice the amount of coconut in a package for less then double the price but it was shredded.  I tried it and now am I sorry.  It's shredded but it's so finely shredded it flies everywhere and sticks to everything and leaves no taste at all.  I am so very disappointed. Will go back to the flaked and never order this again!
5.0,"The lentils make a GREAT base for quick, nutricious, and inexpensive homemade meals!","I have been buying these lentils at my local grocery store for a long while now, but was delighted to find them on Amazon for so much less, no taxes and free to my door delivery!  Now, why lentils, and why these particular lentils? 1) Lentils are high in protein, vit B1, iron, and fiber! 2) Lentils are low in fat, and are also low on the glycemic index! 3) Lentils are a great base for many dishes: within 20 minutes you can have a tasty homemade dinner. Here is my favourite (start the clock): put on some basmati rice. In a separate pot, steam a large chopped onion for a few minutes. Add one can of lentils (always with the liquid!). Add dried garlic bits, chili powder, ginger powder, curry powder, all to taste. Stew for a few minutes. Add garam masala (a spice that can be purchased in most grocery stores) and cook for another few minutes. Serve over the basmati rice. There! Stop the clock! This should not have taken more then 20 minutes. Makes two servings (unless you are very hungry). This can be also prepared using oil (you'd fry the onion, instead of steaming it). The taste of the dish can be manipulated by using other spices (turmeric, cumin, etc.) and adding other vegetables (peas, tomatoes, cauliflower, etc.). You can also try adding some sliced almonds and a few raisins. You can prepare this a day ahead and take to work with you for an inexpensive, but tasty and healthy work lunch! The cost of the meal, including rice and the entire can of lentils, comes to less then four dollars (or thereabout). 4) These lentils are organic, vegetarian, and kosher, for those who are interested.  PS: Do not be put off by the ""funny"" look of the lentil liquid once you have opened the can. It is supposed to look like this. DO NOT drain the lentils!  Enjoy!"
5.0,Great,"This is a great price on this milk, we raise puppies and use alot of it. We are on the monthly shipping program and it works out just great."
1.0,100% Pure Cosmetics - Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream,"Organic Coffee Bean Eye Cream - is a complete waste of money. I have used this product for 3 (three) weeks, no change in the puffiness."
1.0,Do not buy,I wished I had done some research before giving this bone to my dog. In front of my eyes he chocked on it. By the time we got to the Emergancy vet he was gone. I see that this has been an ongoing concern by many others. Hopefully you get to read this before you make any purchases. Loosing your dear friend due to a dog bone is  horrible. I will write to Purina as well. One concern should be enough to do something about this product.
1.0,Candy tasted old,"The candy was sent for a birthday gift.  It is the first time using this company.  The person receiving the gift said some of the candy tasted old.  However, the company is giving me a full refund."
5.0,Mountain Medley granola,"Loved it - don't know that I've ever had better granola - this combined flavor, texture, nutritional value - heartily recommended."
5.0,Chomp-chomp-chomp,"I don't know how to review rawhide chews, but I can say this much:  I ordered them.  They showed up very quickly and in great condition. My dog loves them.  I asked him to be more specific, but he was busy chewing and knows not to talk with his mouth full.  What a good boy."
5.0,New Use,"I just discovered this product. I have hot oatmeal for breakfast...so why am I buying the Kashi 7 Whole Grain Puffs Cereal? I have been losing weight slowly over the past year. My nighttime sweet treat is hot air popcorn Presto 114316 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper  and  Eden Organic Yellow Popcorn, 20-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)  mixed with sugar free pudding.I was getting tired of this every night and was hoping to find another treat to add to my snack list. I decided to look at cereals and found this. I now mix 2 cups of the cereal with 1 container of sugar free pudding and LOVE IT!! I get the sweet crunch and it takes awhile to eat it. Check out the nutrition label...Whole grains, no sugar, no salt,only 70 calories per cup and no added junk. I'm so heppy with my new treat and thrilled to find it at a better price on Amazon."
5.0,Good morning,"I recently tried this blend and I would certainly buy again. This if a nice, flavorful way to start the morning."
5.0,Dog toy that REALLY entertains!,"I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy."
1.0,Weird tasting sugar water,"I love green tea.  I love passionfruit drinks.  I really disliked this.  The beverage is essentially sugar water.  It is being marketed as ""Aloe Vera Green Tea.""  And I have enjoyed aloe drinks in the past.  This is a really cheaply made ""aloe vera"" product sold with a premium price tag.  In general, the order of ingredients indicates the greatest percentage of the product. The ingredient list opens with water, cane sugar, and then ""Green Tea Infusion"" (green tea leaves and more water).  So I'm assuming they made a batch of green tea, and then diluted it with water before bottling it.  Then there is aloe vera, citric acid, and passionfruit flavor (but no actual passionfruit).  The sample I received had pulp in it, but it tastes like orange pulp and not passionfruit.  And there is no indication from the ingredient label if this pulp is even supposed to be in the bottle.  The end result is watered-down weak tasting tea with slightly slimy pulp in it and an artificial citrus taste.  Yuck.  Oh, and though a reasonable person would look at the bottle and think it was a single serving, it is labeled as 1 1/2 servings.  So the 80 calories listed on the label?  You should actually think of that as 120 calories because normal people are not going to drink 8 ozs and save the 3.5 ozs for later."
1.0,do not buy this tea,"this is the worst tea ever.  you definitely get what you pay for, and actually far less.  the flowers used here are far inferior to drinkable rose flowers.  i highly advise against purchasing this item if you want to use it for tea.  even the smell is very pungent and unappetizing, so i would not use this for any type of herbal infusions.  unfortunately, because it is a grocery item, i cannot return it.  the first time i tried rose tea was in seoul, and it was so delicious.  i cannot even imagine that the buds here come from the same species of flower."
1.0,Wrong size pods,"I ordered the wrong size pods. I need pods that will fit my Breville. I need to exchange the pods I received. I have emailed 3 requests to the Seller to no avail. Please give me the return info to return them to you. I am very dissatisfied with this order. Please respond, Gary Gerlitz"
1.0,Low Quality Tea,"I'm a long time drinker of Jasmine Pearl tea -- when I saw this product listing I thought it was too good to be true (a pound?  at such a low price!).  I was right:  it's *very* low quality tea.  It doesn't have the subtle jasmine flavor that's supposed to be present in this tea -- it's bitter and simply doesn't taste good.  Stick with the Numi brand of Jasmine Pearl ... it's fresh with wonderful flavor, and it's reasonably priced.  You can find it here:   Numi Tea Jasmine Pearls, Numi Tea Jasmine Pearls, Flowering Loose Green Tea, 16-Ounce Bag "
5.0,Happy With this Product,"I have been looking for low carb pasta for a while. I tried shirataki pasta, but I did not like the texture. I heard of this pasta on the internet. I did research and decided to try it out. When cooking this, it is better to cook it a shorter amount of time. That is what makes it low carb. Also one thing I read was, reheating this pasta will mess the chemical balance up. I am not sure if this is true, but I would stay on the safe side. So I would recommend cooking it when you are ready to eat, and not reheating it. I am not sure if this is really low carb, there is no absolute way to find out. This also does not work for every one. Trying it before you buy six boxes would be a good idea. I would recommend this to a friend who is trying to watch their carb intake."
5.0,"Knew I liked the product, got what I expected","I wouldn't have ordered 100 of these teabags without trying them first, so I grabbed the smaller size box at my local grocery store. I'd been trying to drink more green tea and realizing my generous cubicle neighbor probably wanted to encourage my new habit, but not necessarily fund it by continuing to ""donate"" bags to me. I really liked the STASH green tea, so before my small box was up, I ordered this one. It is a delicious green tea to me, but as with many green teas, FINISH IT WHILE IT'S HOT. Seriously - if it cools down, it gets bitter. I thought the value of this box was excellent since I'm up to 1-3 cups per day, so this worked well. I posted a few pics of how the packaging came so you can see - no ""retail"" boxes, but they are each individually wrapped. Note that it just came in a cardboard box and the little packs inside weren't lined in a plastic bag, so if you have this delivered, just make sure it stays dry. I think a rainy day on my doorstep could have been messy, though I do think the tea bags are foil lined enough to prevent moisture from entering? Still, I wouldn't want to risk it! I've already added this to my Wish List entitled ""re-stock items"" :)"
5.0,Great Taste,This was good honey in a nice package. I used it as a compliment for the beer I made called Honey Britches. I taped the sticks to the side of the bottles and it added a nice little sweetness to the beer that already used orange honey in the brew process. Honey ferments completely so there was very little residual sugar left which this item helped remedy.
5.0,Best Feta ever!,"I have been ordering this product from NYC at an international grocery store. I am so happy to see that Amazon offers it now. This is the best tasting feta ever (for me). If you like mild feta(not too stinky and not too hard), you cannot go wrong with this one."
1.0,30 mg Caffeine for watered down bland serving,"Very Disappointed in this.  So much so, that I was inspired to write my first review.  This products labeling is just wrong:  1) I called the company stating any cocoa has caffeine, so it cannot be 99% caffeine free. They said it has 30 mg CAFFEINE per 2 tsp. serving which is too little for a good flavor.  2) IT TAKES MORE than 2 tsp. per serving or tastes very watered down & not creamy. I   I required 2 TBSP for 12 oz. water  3) IT WASN'T SWEET at all, just enough to cut the bitter - I assume.   So I preferred adding a regular amount of Stevia for a better taste.  I suggest anyone give Hills Bros Sugar free french vanilla cappuccino a try. Besides tasting great, you'll only get 30mg max. of caffeine for a satisfying 12 oz. serving.  Bon Appetit"
5.0,Crazy for Gooseberries,"I have loved gooseberries ever since I had my first piece of gooseberry pie at a small family bakery in San Luis Obispo county. I've always preferred the more tart fruits in desserts, preserves, chutneys and such.  I find them a refreshing change from the sweeter desserts, etc. I was thrilled to find them available from Amazon and at such a good price.  Amazon ------- not just for books anymore!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,Live kefir grains,"When the grains arrived, they we're in the form of a liquid. I was concerned that they looked nothing like actual grains. The seller sent along instructions which addressed this. Having been my first experience with grains, I didn't know what to expect. Her instructions, which also contained a source where I could learn more, we're invaluable. The seller was communicative and helpful; standing behind her product if I wasn't satisfied. My grains continue to grow and I am delighted by the service and product. Thank you."
1.0,Something is wrong,"At first, I really liked the cereal but suddenly I started getting sick every time I ate it. I do not have any problems with other cereals.  There must be something in the Special K Blueberry that causes my stomach to turn.  My stomach and esophogus were very inflammed according to an endoscopic report.  Obviously I must be allergic to something in it. I stopped eating it for awhile but this morning decided to give it another try.  (I had bought several boxes of it when it was on sale!) Again, I have an upset stomach.  What could possibly be in it that is not in other cereals?  I can eat blueberries with no problems.  I won't try it again."
1.0,These 'treats' are Made in China,"In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.  Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food."
1.0,"I love Silk Soy Milk, but not at $17.23/gallon","18 cartons at 8.25 ounces per carton = 148.25 oz. 148.25 oz. = 1.16 gallons  $20.00 / 1.16 gallons = $17.23 / gallon. For SOY MILK.  If you really want your kids to drink soy milk, go to your local grocery store, get a half gallon of Silk for $3.00, then buy them a Thermos to fill up every day for their lunch.  I love Vanilla Soy Milk, I really do. I'm willing to pay a small premium over regular milk for the lack of cholesterol, etc. without the nastiness that is skim milk. But the existence of this product for this price is almost an insult to our intelligence.  Unless you're independently wealthy, that is. Then buy away."
1.0,Would return if I could,"In all fairness the packaging is sort of pretty. Thats about it, there is next to nothing included in the tiny boxes. At least they could have used a bit more effort when it came to how much goes inside. Not worth the price, will probably add 'extra' from the store before giving it as a neighbor gift this year. My fault for getting caught up in the amazon lightening deal frenzy."
1.0,tea,Bitter taste when brewed even with sugar. small amount in package. Not happy with purchase. would not purchase again. picture does not represent what size you receive.
5.0,best gf bread,"This bread is super-easy to make in a bread machine, and it tastes great. The flour mix produces a flavorful bread which has a good texture. Far better than other bread mixes I've tried."
5.0,Good job!,It is bought for my parents and we need to get it as soon as possible. It is so soon to get the product! Thanks a lot!
1.0,rip-off,"The chips are only a dollar in stores for this size bag, if the chips cost $10, why they couldnt make it 10 bags of chips in a pack? Im just sayin!"
1.0,Does nothing,How do you give something zero stars?  I have tried it three times. It did nothing to give me more energy.  I took one first thing this morning instead of the usual coffee and then took a nap.  Tastes like hell too.  Coffee works better.
1.0,CHECK THE EXP DATE!!!,I JUST REC'D THE CHICKEN ONE TODAY 8/2/12  I ALWAYS ALWAYS CK THE DATES OF EVERYTHING I EAT OR DRINK..FOR MY FURBABIES TOO.. I CAN'T BELIEVE THE..ONE..TIME I DIDN'T (THANK GOODNESS ONLY GAVE ONE TREAT EACH TO EACH DOG) I COULDN;T BELIEVE IT THE DATE SAID ..BEST..USED//BY 7/13/12!!!!  ALL DATES ON EVERYTHING ALWAYS IS A YEAR TO TWO YRS AWAY..SO THIS HAD TO BE VERY OLD..HOW COULD THEY SEND SOMETHING THAT OLD! GRRR HOWEVER THE CO IMMEDIATELY REFUNDED ME...BUT..IM OUT TREATS FOR MY GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER KIND OF TREAT TO ARRIVE NOW!! I WOULD REFRAIN ORDERING FROM THIS CO.
1.0,Waaaay Overpriced!,"I can't believe this vendor is charging over a hundred bucks for guarana syrup! You can get the same exact syrup in Brazilian grocery stores for 9 or 10 dollars! In San Francisco you can get it at Mercado Brazil, 1 Liter for $9, or you can buy it online at a Los Angeles store--brazilianshop.com--for $8.49. Shame!"
1.0,Two Words:  BUG SHELLS,"Not sure what KIND of bug, but a whole mess of 'em HATCHED and left their skins behind....so GROSS!!!  Am still in the process of sending it back, getting my money back - yuck.  I don't even want it in my house, much less to make tea with."
1.0,Buyer Beware!,"These are NOT San Marzano tomatoes - they are grown in the USA. They are not only expensive, but OVERPRICED. This is nothing more than deceptive and false advertising. The company should be ashamed of themselves. If you want real San Marzano tomatoes you need read the label carefully."
5.0,Love them!,"These are really good!  I find Grandpa Po's Originals to be filling and delicious, and since they're technically whole grain, they are way better to have in the house than Doritos."
1.0,NOT SOUR,"Who ever wrote the other reviews saying that this stuff was sour either a) works for the company that produces this candy or b) have not ate anything sour before and should get out of the sour candy review business.  This candy is not bad, but it definitely is not very sour.  Do not buy if you are under the impression that this will be super sour candy."
1.0,Bland fruit - No support - lots of work,"It took forever for fruit to flower - two of the three plants fruited, grew nice-sized tomatoes, but the weight caused them to topple.  Next, the leaves all rotted off but the remaining fruit ripened...bland, ugh, no taste.  The remaining plant finally grew fruit and they ripened red with tons of tape, etc. to support it (that's where all the extra work came in - trying to keep the plant upright).  Taste on these was a little better but far from worth the effort.  Back to herbs!!!  (I do love the aerogarden for the herbs!)"
1.0,No Flavor,"I bought this ""Butter"" flavor at the local grocery store and was very disappointed.  It had no flavor at all except for a mild saltiness. You'd be better off simply using salt on your popcorn."
5.0,Better Than Fresh -- No Waste,Peak blew away my expectations... I had tried powdered milk before. Never have I had milk taste this good. I use it as a staple in my diet and never worry about spoilage. Great for your survival stash. Highly recommend.
5.0,Perfect Popcorn Every Time,"We have been using this for over a year now.  We love it.  It pops perfect popcorn every time. In fact, we like it more than the popcorn at the movie theater.  It is possible to not put all the oil or salt in (with a little practice) if you have guests who want less flavor.  But we think it is perfect the way it is...every time."
5.0,Dee-licious!,"I previously purchased Grade A without thinking about it.  Once I got this product (Grade B) I was back on track with flavor and color.  I like the deeper, richer, more mapely taste of Grade B and this particular syrup is tops with me!"
1.0,Horrible soup don't bother buying it!!!,"I use to LOVE Snow's Clam Chowder, but like all the other reviews, since Bumble Bee took over this brand, it is the worst tasting soup I have ever eaten!!! Usually, eat New England Clam Chowder about once a month with BLT sandwiches. I bought this soup from Grocery Outlet and my boyfriend said ""Well what do you expect""? So.... needless to say I will let the manager, of Grocery Outlet know, that he shouldn't stock this soup, in his store!"
1.0,"I never write reviews, but this is ridiculous",I ordered two bags of this stuff from amazon and both arrives hard as a rock. This is not powdered PB and I find it ridiculous you cannot return defective food products back to Amazon.
5.0,Jolly Time big cheez popcorn,"After reading some of the reviews I was a little sceptic, but this popcorn is addictive my husband took some to work and everyone wants to get some. He left the bag in the break room and when he returned it was all gone.I'ts really good."
5.0,Favorite Bigelow Tea,"This Vanilla Chai is what I crave when it gets cold outside.  It smells absolutely delicious and the vanilla scent wafts through my room, which is more effective/safe/cheap than burning scented candles.  It helps me calm down and avoid reaching for candy when I'm studying at 1 AM. The tea itself isn't very spicy, but just incredibly vanilla-y. I don't add anything to it, but I'm sure a little milk and sugar would make it divine."
1.0,"Worst ""fruit"" roll ever!","I miss read the brand, thinking this was the Jovey fruit rolls I got as a kid. This is NOT anything remotely similar. The texture is that of plastic and it has so much food coloring it is neon orange. What a disaster of an order. It makes fruit by the yard look like health food."
5.0,Yummy!,"I just received my first twelve-pack from Amazon and popped one open to give it a taste.  Wow!  It brought back memories of my childhood when we'd occasionally have coconut water.  I suffered through 2 orders of O.N.E. before I gave up and ordered this brand.  There is absolutely no comparison.  I have no idea why anyone likes O.N.E.  It tastes spoiled.  Anyway, I very highly recommend this brand!"
1.0,Check Expiration date!,"Just received 3 boxes of the Chocolate Cherry Larabars, and they expire in less than two months.  I have eaten a ton of Jocalat Larabars and this batch is definitely dry and stale tasting.  Amazon or Amazing Deals needs to make the expiration date listing more obvious. Who wants to pay for stale Larabars?"
5.0,Delicious,The flavor of this cappuccino is wonderful. Even if you put too much mix in the mug it's still great.  I'm stocking up for winter.
5.0,"Gimme Soome More, 4 Sure!","There was a younger, stronger time when frowns appeared at the sight of HH, but the products have gained much more respect in the golden years so much so that my spouse can help w/cooking!  Be it meatless or w/beef, pork, ham, chicken or tuna,or just plain Alfredo, the basic contents of these products can be prepared to taste gourmet w/just a FEW added ingredients one most likely has on hand for any given meal!  For instance, Sloppy Joes w/sauteed onions and peppers served over toast points w/a salad and a fruit makes for a completely balanced meal.  Have stockpiled cases for emergencies in my safe room, as well as for daily use!"
5.0,Great Flavor,"Easy way to get the product, and it is delicious gum.  Wrapped in secure package.  Can set up renewable order conveniently."
1.0,Awful product,"I've been buying this product for about a year by the 12 units case. The last 2 cases have been horrible, I should have stopped buying them when I got the first bad one. 2 of the 12 cans were banged and when I opened them the artichokes were spoiled, awful smell and color. The rest of the 10 cans all of them taste weird, don't know if over ripe. I ate them anyway they didn't seem spoiled just unpleasant taste that i disguised with dressing. Next case same weird flavor. I will buy them at the grocery store from now on by the unit, price is even cheaper in some stores."
1.0,Sad Decline,"Until recently, Nueske's was my favorite bacon. The perfectly sliced lean strips with their heavenly taste and aroma was always a winner on the breakfast table or as an ingredient in my other dishes. The last two orders I placed with Nueske's have been a huge dissapointment. Much of the smokey flavor was missing and the amount grease left over after frying was astounding; leaving me with hardly any meat. The company is now obviously purchasing inferior pork bellies and rushing the processing time. There are many other premium bacons on the market that are worth a premium price. I would suggest to my fellow bacon connaisseurs out there that you give one of these other companies a try and forget about Greaseke's"
1.0,Not as good as store bought tea bags,The packaging looks the same as the ones you can buy in Asian stores but the tea is weak and lacks the strong body of the store bought bags and it cost more. The only reason I bought it online is the local store didn't have it. But I was very disappointed in the product. Next time I will drive to Portland and buy it instead of buying a poor imitation like this
5.0,Makes delicious brownies!,"I am new to baking with carob powder, but I purchased this based on the other positive reviews. My first batch of brownies was a success! I used about four parts carob powder to 1 part cocoa to keep a little bit of true chocolate flavor, but cut back dramatically on the caffeine. As a bonus, it's not as bitter as cocoa, so you don't need to sweeten as aggressively - my brownies were fine with just stevia. Carob brownies are just a little bit fruitier than cocoa, in a nice way. This is a large amount of carob powder, so if you're not sure you like it, maybe try some out first before buying this much..."
5.0,Absolute all time favorite,Its an absolute must try.. my favorite drink ever.. the flavor just dances and bubbles on the tip of your tongue.. its makes you want to savor every bottle
5.0,Well worth the money,The hot cocoa is delicious and is strong enough to make the larger size. I find all three flavors delicious with my favorite being the dark cocoa.  The best bang for the buck I have so far found for hot cocoa.  I tend to use my coffee maker for everything but coffee.
1.0,Bring back the Original Henry's Blend!!!,"I agree with the other reviewers.  ""Level 4 Seattle's Best"" is NOT the same as ""Henry's Blend.""  Henry's Blend was perfect, level 4 just tastes ""off.""  I'll be looking for a replacement blend."
5.0,SO many uses.,"I know there are a million uses for baking soda but here are mine. Excellent for brushing your teeth. Awesome for cleaning out the bath tub. Works great for deoderizing the fridge. All in all, one of lifes little necessities. Highly recommended."
5.0,Bliss,"Any good dark chocolate is bliss, so Hershey's picked a good name. These are just like the little wrapped chocolates by Dove, and I really don't have a preference. They're both luxurious and worth a try if you're into smooth dark chocolate."
1.0,Just don't.  Unless it's a gift for someone you hate.,"Oh man...words cannot express what happened to me after eating these.  The Gummi Bear ""Cleanse"". If you are someone that can tolerate the sugar substitute, enjoy.  If you are like the dozens of people that tried my order, RUN!  First of all, for taste I would rate these a 5.  So good.  Soft, true-to-taste fruit flavors like the sugar variety...I was a happy camper.  BUT (or should I say BUTT), not long after eating about 20 of these all hell broke loose.  I had a gastrointestinal experience like nothing I've ever imagined.  Cramps, sweating, bloating beyond my worst nightmare.  I've had food poisoning from some bad shellfish and that was almost like a skip in the park compared to what was going on inside me.  Then came the, uh, flatulence.  Heavens to Murgatroyd, the sounds, like trumpets calling the demons back to Hell...the stench, like 1,000 rotten corpses vomited.  I couldn't stand to stay in one room for fear of succumbing to my own odors.  But wait; there's more.  What came out of me felt like someone tried to funnel Niagara Falls through a coffee straw.  I swear my sphincters were screaming.  It felt like my delicate starfish was a gaping maw projectile vomiting a torrential flood of toxic waste.  100% liquid.  Flammable liquid.  NAPALM.  It was actually a bit humorous (for a nanosecond)as it was just beyond anything I could imagine possible.  AND IT WENT ON FOR HOURS.  I felt violated when it was over, which I think might have been sometime in the early morning of the next day.  There was stuff coming out of me that I ate at my wedding in 2005.  I had FIVE POUNDS of these innocent-looking delicious-tasting HELLBEARS so I told a friend about what happened to me, thinking it HAD to be some type of sensitivity I had to the sugar substitute, and in spite of my warnings and graphic descriptions, she decided to take her chances and take them off my hands.  Silly woman.  All of the same for her, and a phone call from her while on the toilet (because you kinda end up living in the bathroom for a spell) telling me she really wished she would have listened.  I think she was crying.  Her sister was skeptical and suspected that we were exaggerating.  She took them to work, since there was still 99% of a 5 pound bag left.  She works for a construction company, where there are builders, roofers, house painters, landscapers, etc.  Lots of people who general have limited access to toilets on a given day.  I can't imagine where all of those poor men (and women) pooped that day.  I keep envisioning men on roofs, crossing their legs and trying to decide if they can make it down the ladder, or if they should just jump.  If you order these, best of luck to you.  And please, don't post a video review during the aftershocks."
1.0,AAAARRRRRGGGGHHHHH!!!!!,"first, the good news:  YES, these are really good. the bad news: They are loaded with monosodium glutamate Of course, this wasn't listed on Amazon as one of the ingredients. This is a good item if you're not sensitive to MSG-- Now I have to go to the 7-11 and buy the fried pork rinds to feed my addiction."
5.0,PERFECT!,"I had several of the carousel type K-cup holders. When I saw this, I knew I could get rid of those and make more room on my counter. This item does just that. Since my brewer sits right on the top of the ""drawer"".  It is well made and holds 36 k-cups...more than the carousel type.  I highly recommend this item."
1.0,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed and I haven't even used it yet.  When I checked the ingredients list on line everything was ok.  A little curious on why they used sodium hydroxide in the yellow, but everything was natural.  That is what I wanted.  When they arrived I read the ingredients on the box and to my surprise the yellow is listed: Glycerin, polysorbate, propylene glycol, filtered deionized water, curcumin.  Polysorbate and propylene glycol, which is used in anti-freeze, aren't natural.  I now can not use the yellow at all.  I have had to order yellow from another company that has all natural colorings.  I am hoping it arrives before Friday so I can use it the frosting of the cake I'm making for my niece's 1st birthday.  I am very disappointed and will not be purchasing this in the future."
1.0,Not the item pictured -- Soy Allergy Sufferers Beware!,"If you are buying these because they are pictured as the Kosher for Passover Paskesz chips, which do not contain soy -- STOP!  The chips I received are not the ones pictured (the orange bag with the ""Kosher for Passover"" designation) -- they are the regular Kosher chips (red bag) that contain soy.  I hadn't bothered to scroll down the page to view the ingredients when I ordered because the picture is clearly of the Passover variety."
1.0,Product lost in Transit! HELP Amazon!,"Tracking app. Indicates item has been received at warehouse near my house. It has been sitting there for nearly two weeks! How do I get it? I can't return it. I don't have it!  Days later: When I reviewed the tracking application today, there is a statement saying shipper LOST item. I have received no notice of this fact. There is no process for contacting anyone. How do I re-order? Get a refund? What's going on Amazon.com?"
1.0,Truffle Cream,wasnt thrilled with this product. i love the taste of Truffles but this lacked any Truffle flavor and had more of an oily taste. will not order this again.
1.0,I don't get it.,"I can't figure out what these things are!  They have the texture of a cracker, but have a sweetness on the outside like a cookie.  They kinda have these chunks of stuff in them - fig I guess - but they're not sweet, really, not do they add much flavor.  They're really crumbly and thin and look like they need to be dipped in something or covered in something - but they're not.  They're like a bland cracker-cookie thing and I just don't get it. - Sorry, I'm not a fan of these things.  These are like crackers with a sweetness on the outer part with chewy bits of whatever distributed throughout.  The bits of fig stuck to my teeth really badly - which was bizarre.  The cookie themselves have a very crumbly texture and break up in your mouth into nothingness.  No real strong flavor here and hardly sweet at all.  The term ""fruit"" is used loosely here, as the ""fruit"" is just these tiny bits throughout each cracker-cookie that you can barely taste anyway.  PASS. *** Update:  I'm giving these 1 star.  Been eating them for a week now and they're just terrible.  I keep trying them, hoping they'll grow on me, but the weird texture and stuff sticking to my teeth have made me grown to hate them.  These are garbage. ***"
5.0,Awesome Meals Ready to Eat,"I loved the chick peas,they were tasty and so easy.  It might be a little spicey for the faint hearted, but I enjoy eating spicey food, so this was a winner with me."
5.0,Best oatmeal known to man,This is the absolute best oatmeal!  It helped my husband lower his cholesterol significantly.  It takes awhile to cook - but I just cook a big pot of it once a week and then warm it up in the microwave each morning.
1.0,disapointing,"This stuff was not rediculously expensive, but it was expensive enough. I expected that real gormet.. I wasn't thrilled.. didn't taste very strong and it was way too soft.. haribo's licorice wheels are much better."
5.0,wonderful!!,"i grew up in calif. where see's was born, and it has been a tradition in our family for generations. they are absolute quality! i ordered some last march and they were unusually damaged in shipment. i waited until now, 10 months later, to let them know. i did not expect a refund of course. i couldn't believe it when they offered to send me out new chocolates!! that is 1st class service for a 1st class product. i am in france now and i would rather eat see's than a french chocolate any day of the week."
5.0,Irish Breakfast Decaf,"Very smooth and satisfying.  I am allergic to caffiene and this tea fills the desire for a warm cup in the morning.  Have with milk.  Love getting it on my front porch and also use it at my Cafe. With my subscription and Amazon Prime, it's a bargain."
5.0,Party Pleasure!,"Perfect for a cocktail party! You get your choice of cashews, peanuts and honey roasted. Just put these snack size packages in a party bowl or on a party platter. You pick the snack, that you want, without everyone putting their bare hands on unopened choice of snacks. Not everyone washes their hands, when they should. This keeps the germs and critters clean and fresh! Don't let your friends get sick, when you can easily prevennt spreading those germs!"
1.0,This soup gives dishwater a bad name,"Just tried this soup for the first time.  It is watery, bland-to-flavorless.  My soup did not have as many letils as the spoon on the container picture in the entire cup. There is simply no way there is 1/2 cup of vegetables in this 1 cup serving.  Save your money, a cup of tap water is more flavorful."
5.0,"very fudgy but not ""that"" sweet","This is definitely a great dessert!!! It's very good and does have a fudge-tasting taste to it... but it's not all that sweet. I have had other vegan desserts that were much sweeter than this. but still, I love this raweo cookie and definitely recommend! IT REALLY IS SO GOOD!"
5.0,Greatest product ever!,"My son and I have wheat allergies and this product was a life saver.  I can make cookies that taste like cookies, cakes, cupcakes, pancakes.  LOVE it!"
5.0,Great buy,I received the item right on time and it was exactly what I was expecting. I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase.
1.0,Sea Salt Garbanzo beans,It was like eating cardboard!  These were awful.  Can't find anyone who wants them because they are worse than tasteless.
5.0,Luzianne Tea is the best,I have always preferred Luzianne tea to others. When Luzianne came to Texas I tried a sample and never went back to Lipton.... that was many many years ago. When our local stores quite selling anything but the family size bags I had to find another source. Thanks
5.0,Yum!,"First thanks to everyone who reviewed. All of you assisted me with cooking a quality product.  These noodles mix well with just about any seasoning you can throw their way. I even used leftovers and was able to make quick, very tasty meals.  Rinsing in cold water is important so they don't continue to cook to mush. I've reheated them in the microwave after the rinse and they remain firm.  I am very pleased and will continue to purchase them."
1.0,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!,"I saw the coffee offered with ""free"" shipping an ordered it. My coffee was AWFUL!!!!!!!! It was old, stale and had no aroma. When it was ground, there was NO cleanup for my grinder: no coffee oils were present. I had to spend $51.00 Kirkland Rwandan coffee I know is good and try to mix some of this stuff with to use it up. I wiil never buy this brand again."
5.0,Our Family's Favorite..,"This is a staple food at our house. It's the only cereal that my children (all eight of them) NEVER get tired of! It has a wonderful toasty corn taste, yet it's packed with good-for-you stuff. Amazon's price (especially when their special is going) is outstanding."
1.0,Nasty,I almost gagged when I had this flavor. I can't believe so many people actually like it. I had to dump it out.
1.0,Great Muesli but overpriced now,"With disparity between the Dollar and the Euro, the price of this cereal has been rising where a lot of groceries have simply dropped it.  I was glad to find it on Amazon; actually it was pointed out to me via an e-mail to Switzerland. I have been eating this cereal for over 20 years on a daily basis.  They have changed the formulation over the years a little [more oats initially]but it still the closest to true Swiss Muesli since I was introduced to it in the 1950's. Only one local store comes close in price but they do not always have it. ***They ran out of this on Amazon and through one of their vendor it is now $72 per carton with shipping!  That's $12 a carton!  You can get it typically for under $9 in the store.  I tried a carton of the Original (Orange) formula.  Still the old price.  But it is very sweet.***"
5.0,cook,Arrived in excellent shape with no breakage.  Were very well made and strong enough to handle my various fillings.  Would definitely buy again.
5.0,I Love this stuff!!!  I am a Xangoaholic!!,"This is the most wonderful thing that I have ever used...My mother has been battling cancer for 10 years and this gives her the energy to get going and not feel sick from chemo....I have been using it and my psoriasis is clearing up!  This is just amazing stuff!!  I love it and everybody should try it, even if you don't think you have any problems and you don't need it...Just try a bottle!!!"
1.0,So awful I can barely describe,"This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail"
5.0,Can't live without it!!!,"I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!!!!!!  I tried this product about 20 years ago and can't live without it!  I put it on everything, from eggs to fruit.  It's the best stuff ever!"
5.0,Winning the picky little dog battle...,"My boyfriend who works at small chain pet store turned me on to Stella and Chewy's. I can't say enough good things! I have a Dachshund with skin and weight problems. We were on the hunt for a grain free food he wouldn't turn his long nose up at and were just coming up short in all respects. He hated everything! One of the first suggestions was Stella and Chewy's but I shrugged it off because to me, the price was much too high (my dog food experience up until this point sadly was one of frugality rather than what you're actually feeding the dog). After buying bag after bag of things he didn't even want to taste, I caved and we bought him a small bag of these patties. He wolfed it down! I was shocked!  The better result came when my mother's Chihuahua/Min-Pin mix got herself a taste. This dog weighs next to nothing because she refuses to eat all but one flavor of a certain cheap-o canned food, and even then you have to specially prepare it before she even thinks about wanting to eat. I gave her a small piece and it was gone before I knew it! She hoarked down a whole patty in seconds. Amazing!  If you have a picky eater, especially a picky small breed dog, this is well worth the investment. Five stars! :D"
1.0,Ummmm.... I don't think this is ranch!,"Yeah, so I bought this from local grocery store for $1. It tastes absolutely horrible. It does not taste like ranch. ....... At all."
1.0,natural???,"I am not quite sure why this product is found under the 'natural' foods category.  In the ingredients we find artificial flavors and we also find partially hydrogenated oils.  This product most certainly should not be considered ""natural"" or healthy."
1.0,GROSS!,I bought these as a gift and even though they are funny they taste awful!
1.0,Note that these are the strong variety,"I love Hayward's pickled onions, but if you have not tried the strong variety I would suggest that you start with the normal variety. Those are the ones that you have likely eaten at British pubs, etc. The strong variety is much too vinegary for my taste. Also be very aware of pricing when you order these."
1.0,the coffee was almost expired,"I bought several bags of first colony organic coffee in the end of May, 2011 but they send me the coffee's expiration date in AUG., 2011"
5.0,Great Coffee!,"The Winter Spice coffee from Harmony Bay is the best coffee.  It is alway consistant, never bitter and the only thing I don't like is it is only around in the winter months..."
1.0,Hard Plastic,"Another great idea for a dog toy, but my medium-sized dog cracked the yellow covers in less than 5 min. The plastic shattered. She will never see those little yellow covers again. I might find a way to cover the food wells with something else, now that I'm stuck with this toy. My dog is not a chewer, and this toy did not stand up."
1.0,eeeewwwwww,"Let's see. Tasted like chalk, didn't actually dissolve into liquid, LOTS of sugar, NO pom taste that I could discern and no noticeable 'boost' in energy. Seems like epic fail on all counts."
5.0,Great Pizza - You can get it cheaper though!!,I love this pizza! I grew up eating it but they don't sell it where I live now.  I found it at [...] and paid less than $33 - including shipping!!  The $20 shipping charge is absolutely ludicrous. [...] also allows you to use Paypal so it is safe!
1.0,I would give them a zero star if they had one,I threw both bags out. Wasted $18 plus dollars. They were not fresh. I felt like I was chewing on cardboard. Don't waste your money.
5.0,"Delicious, healthy, a real treat!","I've recently discovered, and some may say become obsessed with raw nut and seed butters,  I had ordered and devoured a jar of raw pumpkin seed from a different supplier, Then when I went to reorder, must to my dismay, the price was now outrageous!  $65.00 for  a jar.  So I thought, what should I do?  Luckily, Amazon came through for me, I found this brand while googling on Amazon,,,,and gave it a whirl, Well, it came in today and it's yummy,  No complaints,  This will fit the bill just fine,  I am not sure if it is raw, but it is coldpressed,  And it tastes healthy,  Hurray! Is a better value for the dollar too!"
5.0,Smooth Chiapas Mexican Coffee with Natural Chocolate notes,This is a smooth coffee with delightful flavors and natural chocolate fragrances and flavors too. It is now my favorite of coffees to buy. I make it in my Espresso machine; but I have also enjoyed it by the drip coffee method. I actually like it best by drip; but it is easier to use the Gaggia Espresso machine with the burr grinder. I like to drink this coffee with soy milk vanilla flavored and sweeten it and then it tastes like Chocolate is in there with the coffee. I do drink it black as espresso most often though. It is great that it is so smooth even when made concentrated. It is an organic medium roast. The best of the Chiapas coffee beans do have this naturally occurring chocolate molecule fragrance and flavor in the beans.
5.0,Too good!,"I am actually embarassed to tell you how much I love these organic, sun-dried, unsulfured figs ~ they are too good!  My true confession ~ I can eat the entire 7-ounce bag of  Made In Nature Organic Calimyrna Figs, Sun-Dried and Unsulfured, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) ... in one sitting!  I crave these sweet, moist figs and have absolutely no self control once the package is opened.  And the package says there are 5 servings to the bag...yikes!  Thank goodness I can purchase them at Amazon for a much better price than at my local health food store.  They are such a good value at Amazon, I buy them frequently."
1.0,"Too sweet, Not organic, Not all natural",13g of sugar per bar. It's too sweet to our liking. Much sweeter than the date bar. Sugar tastes artificial. It doesn't state all natural or organic on the packaging. Very tangy and dense paste. We will try the nuts variety next time.
5.0,delicious cruelty-free crackers!,these are the best animal crackers i've ever tasted! the chocolate simply adds to the deliciousness. they taste like mini-cookies. they are vegan and thus cruelty-free! organic and yummy. what more can be asked of an animal cracker!
1.0,BROWNIEEE SCUMBAGS SENT ME 10 CAPSULES!!!,"BROWNIEEEE WILL LIE TO YOU AND SEND YOU ONLY 10 CAPSULES!!!  ALSO, YOU CANNOT CONTACT THEM!!!!  THEY ARE CON-ARTIST RIP-OFF SCUM"
1.0,NO FLAVOR  Spent over $100.00 on 6 jars,"I purchased 6 jars of this Almond Butter on a suggestion from someone who had eaten it before.  I am so disappointed, After spending well over $100.00.  There was ABSOLUTELY NO HINT  of an Almond Flavor.  It tasted bland and had no distinct flavor at all.  I am trying to contact the company to get a refund."
1.0,Won't touch it,"I thought my cat would enjoy this, but he just sniffs it and walks away.  He won't even try it."
5.0,Very tasty candy.,My mother grew up with Quality Street candy in the 1950's in England.  I've always been partial to Quality Street chocolate over American chocolate.  I took this tin of candy in to the office and it lasted about 3 hours before it was all eaten.
5.0,great snack for dieters!@,"these are just great for dieters, they are only 100 calories per pack, great to throw in lucnch sack, and are nice and crunchy too, very flavorable too!"
1.0,CARDBOARD COFFEE?,"Lets keep this simple... This coffee has NO FLAVOR, except for a hint of cardboard.  I used half the bag to make a pot and it was still tasteless.  Worst thing I ever bought on Amazon."
5.0,Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers,"These disposable cups are great!  The simple, clean method of a portion pack but with your own grounds.  Now I need to see if they pack them in larger quantities.  The seller was also great. I got what I wanted and ahead of time also.  No issues to report here.  Anyone with the K-Cup system needs to get this product from this seller."
1.0,Product has changed,"I fell in love with these cookies when I discovered them a few months ago, and wrote a positive review. I had them special ordered when I couldn't find them in the store anymore. Unfortunately, the order delivered to me was a completely different cookie. Late July changed the recipe, and they tasted awful. I emailed the company and they replied: ""We did have to make some changes to our sandwich cookies, as we had to switch to new equipment which is a slightly different production process.  We are using the same ingredients but it is not exactly the same.  EXCEPT, to further complicate things we had an issue where, towards the end of the most recent production run, we moved to a new supply of our organic vanilla extract and have now come to learn that the concentration level was higher than we normally use.  We truly apologize for that which causes that sensation at the back of the mouth, liking a spicy or burning. The cookies are a little different in texture and taste, but pretty close without that extra vanilla extract. We did take the opportunity to make some improvements to the base cookie, with a better texture and increased the whole grains and reduced the saturated fat in the cookie. I'm sorry you are disappointed; but it was an equipment change we had to make.  Although we realize you may not like the new version, in addition to your refund I would like to send you a coupon to get a free box so that you may try them as they are intended to taste."" So, I am awaiting my refund, and plan to try the cookie again later to see if it tastes better without the vanilla problem."
1.0,:-?,I bought this for a back packing trip and it did not turn out well. Out of the 30+ people on the trip not one liked the taste. Although if you make according to the directions it is easy to mix up and cook. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0,"C.E.T. HEXtra Premium Oral Hygiene Chews with Chlorhexidine for Medium Dogs, 30 Chews","I ordered these for my 29 pound Wheaten Terrier as she munches on them.  This packaged was labeled exactly the same as the previous packages (size).  However, when I received them each chewie was half the size and paper thin.  These were not fit for a very small dog, let alone a medium dog.  I threw them away as I would not take a chance that my dog would choke on them.  I then decided to call the company.  I was told that they were aware of the problem and needed to do something with their quality control.  I ask her where they were made and she told me Mexico. BE WARE."
1.0,Half Caff,"A real dissapointment. With my regular brewer I have made my own half caff by blending a Starbucks caff and decaf for years. When I got my Keruig I thought this half-caff product would be the best answer for me, but it isn't. This tastes like a mixture of weak coffee and dishwater. Why Green Mountain put this out is a mystery. Green Mountain has a good caff coffee called Dark Magic and a good decaf coffee called Dark Magic Decaf. All they would have to do is use half of each of these in a K-cup and they would have an excellent half-caf. I know because I have a 20 ounce mug that I have brewed 9.5 ounces of each of these together and the taste is great. The only explanation for this Green Mountain half-caff product is that they must think that anyone who would buy a half-caf probably doesn't care much about taste, so they can use two cheaper coffees. Half-caff coffee drinkers DO care about taste. Message to Green Mountain: Give us a 50:50 mixture of the Dark Magic caff and Dark Magic decaff coffees, call it Dark Magic Half Caff so people will know what it is,  and deep six this product."
5.0,I like these quite a bit... good diet food,"These oat cakes are really more like super-crumbly crackers... and they are quite good, even if they are heinously overpriced.  I enjoy eating them by themselves, they have a variety of textures and layers of flavor; a great substitute for other, less healthy, mindless eating, and one small packet can be stretched out for a while.  Interestingly enough, the organic version tastes saltier (pleasant surprise) but both their plain oat varieties are quite good.  I also like that each box contains more than one sealed packet, so you can eat a few at one sitting and save the others without worrying about them going stale.  A nice touch; very considerate of the consumer."
5.0,Raven's Brew Coffees are among the best,"Found Raven's Brew when we moved to Ketchikan, it's home base of sorts.  Every variety we have tried has been wonderful, never bitter.  Deadman's Reach is strong and flavorful, perfect black or with your favorite additions.  The decaf versions are just as good, can't even tell the difference!"
5.0,Life Savers!!,"We have a Bengal. They are known to be smarter, feistier and more opinionated than the average cat. When ours was struck with a sudden mystery illness that caused acute life threatening anemia - after a week in the hospital he came home with a strict and huge pill routine.  For two weeks we fought, got bit, scratched, foamed on, etc. we tried liquids. Pills. Hiding them in food. Hiding them in other treats. Everything. He wasn't getting his meds - he'd throw them up. Foam them all out. Eat around them, etc.  As a last hope we tried the pill pockets. I figured he was WAY too smart for this trick. The pills he takes are huge and foul smelling - I couldn't imagine he'd not smell them or not bite into them whole eating it.  But - they worked!! And not just once - every time. He's going to be on steroids for probably a year, and into month 3 he still takes his 3 pills daily with pleasure! Talk about a literal life saver, we wouldn't have made it without them."
5.0,GREAT PRODUCT,My family enjoys this coffee.  It gets the job done.  I have a very physical job that keeps me tired. By the next morning this gets me up.
5.0,Freshly grated nutmeg,Great stuff to have in the kitchen. Good delivery.  Would buy again.
5.0,Excellent Quality,These glazed walnuts are always fresh and Amazon has the best price on them.  I use them in a salad I make and they are always a hit.  Joe
1.0,Overall Awful!,"The mango is edible once you get past the rubbery dry texture, but the apple and others are just awful! The apple was not only chewy in a bad way, and I like apple rings, but extremely tart- maybe it is because I am used to mrs mays freeze dried fruits but I will not order this set again... No idea what I will do with the rest of the packages...rubbery fruit that cannot be bitten is just the wrong texture for me maybe- very dry too!"
1.0,MOCAFE,"Did not like this at all.  Way too sweet, not enough spice (and I am not a very spicy person ).  Definately like Big Train brand better."
5.0,Great new option,"Tried the berry blend after seeing it on display in the grocery store. After trying it I went back and bought the remainder of them (10), and keep checking back for more. I LOVE them. they are sweet, but naturally tasting sweet from the berries - real whole blueberries, and pieces of raspberries and strawberries. I will continue to get these, I make them part of my healthy, low sodium diet - try and you will probably like!!"
1.0,Used for coconut cake recipe on the Pamela's Site,"I did not use this mix as just the vanilla cake, but I used it to make the coconut cake recipe that is on the Pamela'e website. We love the chocolate cake mix but this one is not as great. The cupcakes that we made turned out bad and as my brother in law said, it was like eating saw dust. The texture was horrible and we probably will not buy this mix again."
5.0,great cafe,It was a well packaged item. Good smell and great taste. For the money better than Senseo. I will get subscritption so I can continue receiving this excellent product.
1.0,Yuck.  Where'd the good stuff go?,"My kids used to LOVE Quaker Instant Oatmeal. It was a quick way to get them a hot breakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted ""funny"". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a ""fresh"" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether."
5.0,Delicious Price,I got a 6 pack for just over $20. Flavor is just like expresso (at least to me). No complaints here :)
1.0,"For a Healthy Dog, Avoid This Dog Food","One of the ingredients on the label is ""Natural Flavors"" which is glutamate in hiding.  Glutamate is a neuro toxin which can destroy your dog's health.  The company is very deceptive.  They avoid giving a direct answer.  They call glutamate a vegetable extract which it indeed is, however, when one component is extracted, it creates an imbalance that can be harmful.  I will say this.  My dogs like it, but that is the purpose of glutamate, a flavor enhancer.  Added later:  Why should anything need to be extracted to enhance the flavor of quality food for pets or humans for that matter.  I now make many of my dogs meals from mostly raw ingredients and give them Organix dog food when I need a quick meal.  For those who are concerned about their pet's health, I suggest the book ""Natural Health for Dogs and Cats"" by Dr. Richard Pitcairn, D.V.M."
1.0,3RD ORDER WAS DISGUSTING!!!,"I ordered this for the 3rd time. The first and second time I liked it and the 3rd time was disgusting. I can taste the tin can, and the pulp tasted old. I never leave feedback, but this was so gross."
5.0,"Dog with Allergies, Sensitive Stomach","I have been feeding Nature's Variety Instinct, turkey and duck, to my German Shepherd for almost a year now. He has suffered with allergies (both food and environmental), and has a very sensitive stomach. I am very happy with Nature's Variety, and my guy does great on it. I recommend it to anyone who has struggled with finding a food for a dog with allergies. I also appreciate Amazon selling it with a repeat delivery service. It is really nice not having to go out and buy it every month!"
1.0,Awful,I purchased these and they were awful.  So bad I threw all 400 in the trash. They taste like salty water. Sorry Kari it's the truth
1.0,Bookbinder's NO SNAPPER Soup,This company has ripped off the consumer by not making it condensed like it used to so you get less soup for a can of it.  PLUS NO MEAT IN IT WHATSOEVER.  They SHOULD be ashamed of themselves!
1.0,Awful!  Do not buy!,"I like to use canned chicken to make chicken salad sandwiches for lunch now and then.  I was very disappointed in this canned chicken.  It tasted horrible, which is surprising in just white meat.  I do not know how they could have so thoroughly removed all flavor from the chicken and am not sure I want to know.  I realize it's salt free but that usually doesn't seem to matter with other brands as I flavor it when making the salad.  I usually like Hormel products so it was very disappointing.  I will not be buying it again.  Yuck!"
1.0,False Advertising,Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?
1.0,Destroyed in Minutes,"I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!  This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum."
5.0,Delicious!!,I received a complimentary Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade! Quaker has really outdone themselves!
5.0,homemaker,"This product is rich an creamy quick to fix an enjoy Much better than I make an the price is certainly affordable Great snack, midnight munchie an add salad garlic bread good meal for lunch or dinner"
1.0,Disappointed,"I purchased the Crown Prince brand to save on my grocery bill.  I thought they were terrible. To me, neither the clams or the juice was pleasant tasting. They were very finely chopped, as if they had been pulsed in a food processor.  I've gone back to Snow's."
5.0,Good snack,"I liked these pretzels, but some may say that they do not have enough flavor. My roommate says that they just taste like pretzels. I like that the taste is not overwhelming, but I guess it's not for people that like snacks with really strong flavors (like Doritos)."
5.0,BEST & Healthiest natural sweetener anywhere!,"Before Dr. Oz told everyone about blue agave sweetener, I had found this to be the BEST and healthiest natural sweetener!  I use this all year long and even as a pancake syrup!  Anywhere you would use sugar, you can substitute organic raw blue agave.  My blood glucose levels remain stable and that's a very important thing!  I'm not a diabetic (thank God) and I use this sweetener to avoid ever becoming diabetic and recommend it to any diabetic or someone who just wants to keep their glucose levels low."
1.0,highly unpleasant.,"I gave this product a very fair shot, but after opening up the carton and taking my first bite I instantly regretted ever purchasing it. For the record, I'm a fan of most sweet things, and I'm also really into nutrition and healthy options. I've eaten some weird things in my day in the name of good nutrition, and completely enjoyed them, but this is one of the worst experiences I've had with diet food, hands down. The flavor was awful, I would venture to say disgusting. So much so that this stayed in my freezer for over four months. Every week or so I'd give it another shot and take a few bites, remember how disgusting it is, and be done. I guess on the bright side, I was always so grossed out that my cravings and desires for food would just disappear completely out the window. I finally ended up throwing the rest of it into a protein shake, which was still gross."
1.0,Most Disappointing Box Brownies Ever = skip the impulse 2 Buy,"While everything is relative and this might be a terrific brownie IF you worship at the Temple of Low Carb diets, this version of Brownies was a monumental disappointment. The process requires 3 eggs and lots of butter (read Unhealthy), then requires cooking in a water bath (dish within a dish of water), requires glass square dishes, and comes out as a thin brownie with a crust. The process was laborious and the result was very unsatisfying, being thin like the height of bread, poorly textured, and poor mouth feel product. I can't say too little about this product, except that this product makes one savor and fully appreciate the genius and deliciousness of Ghiradeli and Betty Crocker box brownies."
1.0,Tastes like mud,"You get what you pay for with this product.  I drink Matcha Tea daily and absolutely love it.  When I saw the price and reviews I thought I had found the perfect product at a great price.  It has a dirty/muddy flavor that is disappointing to say the least. Try DoMatcha 2nd Harvest, good price and much better flavor at a good price."
5.0,Yum!,"I have been introduced to yeast flakes just recently.  I must say that they're very yummy when added to sour cream dips, eggs, and just about anything that you want a flavor boost with.  They're packed with protein too, so that's a good thing since I don't take in as much as I should.  Being an omnivore myself, I never would have probably even tried these if it weren't for my herbivore girlfriend."
5.0,I am never without this product - a must-have!,"Healthy, not expensive, and according to my dogs, irresistible!  I store mine in the fridge and every time I open the door I get an audience of tail-waggers waiting for a piece of this dog food roll!  I use this as a treat or as a supplement in their kibble."
1.0,This brand is awful,"I had to come here and review this product because I saw the reviews and had to let people know the truth. All the other people who reviewed this product are the people who are selling the product. A friend of mine works for this ""company"" and gave me some free samples of this product because i like energy drinks and this was an all natural/healthy energy drink. Well this drink is a joke. I had 5 different kinds including this one, and they all tasted awful. They gave me absolutely no energy at all. After i had drank the peach tea one(or whatever tea flavor one it was), i fell asleep.  listen, if you are into healthy energy drinks because you dont want the chemicals and extra sugar, thats fine, but you are going to want something that tastes good and at leasts gives you the extra energy you want, which this product does not have.  I really cant think of a ""healthy"" energy to recommend just because most have sugar or the ones that are sugar-free have some kind of chemical in it that makes it that way. I did used to get FRS a lot, i didnt mind the taste and they gave me a nice little boost, but it started to get alittle pricey.  Just stay away from this XS brand and company, they dont sell quality."
1.0,"I love Lorann flavors, but not this one","The chemical taste is overwhelming and there's nothing remotely honey-like about it. I will continue to use Lorann flavorings, but not this one."
1.0,Disappointing,"False advertising on the box. I bought a 7 oz. box showing off a gorgeous picture of beautiful holiday striped candy. I opened the box to find five pieces of plain ALL ONE COLOR ribbons of candy: Yellow, green, white, orange, pink, and. and one single piece was orange and white. Plain boring Lollypop flavors. Plus the orange solid and the orange with a white stripe were exactly the same orange flavor.  Where were the gorgeous waves of mixed bright holiday colored ribbons as the photo on the box shows off? This is not what I expect when I spend money on ribbon candy. This company pretty much has had the market cornered for years, and years ago used to put out a good product of beautiful candy. Like everything else these days, it's been dumbed down to plain and boring. The only thing that looked like Christmas candy, was the ribbon shape.  When I was a kid I remember my mother buying ribbon candy and they looked like the box photo and had rich flavors like the above, but also spicy flavors of wintergreen, peppermint, and anise and hot cinnamon. The current boring lemon, lime, orange, weak cinnamon, and an indistinguishable flavor in white ribbon, are not worth the money. Buy a cheap bag of suckers and save your money.  If they still make other flavors they should package 12 shorter ribbons of mixed variety instead of 6 longer ribbons of common lollypop flavors."
1.0,Lack of Information.............,"What is the weight of this product?  Am I paying for one ounce or one pound?  It's frustrating to be about to place an order and find vital info is missing.  Catherine in Yuma, AZ"
1.0,dont do it,We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !!
1.0,Not very healthy?,"My son loves these milks and we used to get them for him when we went to Starbucks.  I was familiar with the Horizon brand and thought that the vanilla flavor would be fine.  I began to notice a few times after drinking this he would say his tummy hurt or he would act sick(really tired) shortly after drinking them.  I read the label and saw 29g of sugar...yeah holy cow!  When we serve him a flavored milk I give him Gerbers smart sips, they have vanilla and mild vanilla flavor with 11g of sugar, I think the mild vanilla has even less grams of sugar.  He still loves the taste too!  I find them in the babyfood aisle at the grocery store."
5.0,delicious low-cal comfort on winter days... or any day!,"This fantastic chai is the real deal. Even my Indian friends love it and asked me for the brand name! It has a rich, soothing taste that is perfect in times of stress or on cold winter days. I keep a box at work and several boxes at home, so I'm never without it.  Try it with a high quality french vanilla creamer, such as Hershey's (made with real whole cream). Only 35 calories per serving."
1.0,Not very good I'd stay away.,"Now I know why they don't keep this cheese popcorn in stores.  Way, way too salty and cheesy. And the cheese isn't very tasty.  Thumbs down here folks."
5.0,A really high quality black garlic,"Peeled is the only way to go; I tried buying unpeeled once and my hands were black and sticky after peeling just a few cloves and I wound up with half the garlic I thought I'd get because of the cores and things. This is much butter and actually higher quality anyway and I wind up with twice as much in the end for the same weight of unpeeled. Very rich in flavor and an excellent texture. This is a great anti-inflammatory and it's touted the best ""superfood"" of the year because all of the benefits of white garlic are doubled or, in some cases, some antioxidants become 5 times stronger during fermentation. Very sweet.  Eat meals with black garlic and green tea and your doc, like my mom's doctor, will ask what in the world she is doing to make her tests do a health flip."
1.0,Taste good but did little,"a very flavorful ""shot"" which didn't raise my heart rate one iota or make me feel alert. Doesn't specify exactly how much caffeine is included, so you get thumbs down on that one."
1.0,Moth trap,"This product does not work.  We know we have a clothing moth problem.  We frequently kill the flying adults and vacuum the rugs, carpets, and other areas where the eggs are laid, but they are still not completely eradicated.  However, NONE of the traps ever contained anything."
1.0,I'm not going to buy the product again via mail,"I relly liked it last time I got it from local store. However, the package came with melted bulk. It totally ruined my appetite. By the way, Costco sell it for much less."
5.0,My dog loves these,"I purchased the large 15 count pork chomps and my dog loves them. They are way better than regular rawhides and they last longer too, not too mention they are healthier and won't expand in your dog's tummy. Will definitely purchase again."
1.0,Napoleon Sour Bon Bon,These were not delivered as pictured.  They were not the bon bons I remember as a child.  They seemed to be a marginal copy.  Very disappointed
5.0,Wow!  Finally coffee I can make!,"Let me just say that I am so impressed with the Senseo machine.  I can never get coffee tasting just right, so the pod system really attracted me.  I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.  It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk.  I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.  I finally can have a great tasting cup of coffee whenever I want it!  It's perfect if you're a college student!"
5.0,Great Tea for Nursing Moms!,"This tea is great for keeping up your milk supply while you are nursing baby.  It tastes great, boosts milk production, and even soothes an upset stomach.  I highly recommend it to new moms.  Also, it's a great way to make sure you drink enough water throughout the day."
5.0,Love this..,My family loves this coffee. I enjoy the rich flavor and aroma. It is very convenient to get it once a month also.
5.0,My Daughter Loves It,I am picky about what I feed my daughter. Her health is in my hands and I intend on caring for it to the best of my ability. This is an amazing product. Probiotics are essential for human beings and babies are not an exception to that fact. We have the multigrain and oatmeal variety of this product. My daughter loves to eat both. I believe breakfast is one of her favorite meals of the day and it because she loves this product so much.
1.0,Way overpriced!,"I love the cereal, but my local Safeway (San Jose California) has priced this product at $4.79 each, one sale today at 4.49. Some on-line sellers are even higher than Amazon! I'm underwhelmed by the lack of inexpensive product online."
5.0,Good creamer,Perfect coffee creamer for my coffee. Perfect addition to my coffee. Would recommend to anyone who needs a perfect compliment to your morning coffee.
1.0,ridiculous price,$3.29 + $5.51 shipping?  making it $8.80 for a product you can buy in a store for $3.50?  why doesnt the seller sell by the box with a decent shipping rate and it would be worth purchasing.
5.0,:),Very good tea.  I received the tea in a recent amount of time also.  Thank you.
1.0,Organic Red Bull--loaded with Caffeine,"I haven't had a caffeine-high like that since college. And to think they suggest giving this to kids! Granted, it's organic caffeine--so think of this is an Organic Red Bull."
5.0,Great way to make ends meet.,"I thought it was too go to be true but I tried anyway. I made a meatloaf, chilli, hamburgers, and tacos with half burger and half TVP. Could not tell the difference. Glad I tried it. Easy on the budget and good source of fiber."
5.0,great product!,I've been feeding my cat this since he was little and he loves it! He is a healthy weight and always gets a clean bill of health at the vet. I would definitely recommend this cat food to anyone!
5.0,Favorite,"A friend send Greenies to my cat. It was an instant favorite! So what to do when we ran out of them? Order via Amazon, of course. To my cat's delight, the order was delivered in just days."
5.0,Great tea! But $7 for shipping?,"Stash is by far the best company for jasmine tea. I love this stuff! The only thing I would say to a new customer is don't reuse tea bags. Other than that, enjoy! It doesn't get better than this! I don't understand why you would buy it from this vender though. The shipping is outrageous! You can get this tea at many grocery stores, and there are many places online were you can get free shipping."
1.0,Very bland.,This had no flavour. About all I could taste was sour and not very much of it. Threw it away after the first try.
1.0,Expired crackers!,"I was excited to find these on Amazon after trying them on a recent flight.  When we had them on the airplane, they were creamy and delicious, just like the name!  So I ordered them from Amazon and was sorely disappointed.  When I opened the crackers, they tasted dry and stale, but were still edible so I thought perhaps they were just a different cracker than what I had originally had.  I looked all over the packages for an expiration date and couldn't find anything printed.  Finally, when I examined the cardboard shipping box they came in, I realized that the crackers had expired TWO YEARS AGO!  Amazon was good about refunding my money immediately, but the seller should be ashamed!"
1.0,Not up to expectations,I've been looking for a cream enhancer since seeing it demonstrated in a gourmet cooking class.  Couldn't find the exact name brand they used so tried this.  I think it has a lemon tinge to the taste and will not be using it so wasted my money.
5.0,Wonderfull!,This is the best tea I have ever tasted in my life!  It is so delicate yet so flavorful.  I have not bothered to drink any other tea in 2 years.
1.0,Hazelnut?!?,Ugh... no where on the Amazon page for this item did it state that it was Hazelnut flavored.  I have been choking this down for a month just trying to get through it.  Thought it was going to be a Blue Mountain-like Jamaican coffee...
1.0,"Perhaps this is authentic, but it doesn't smell right to me","This ""Chinese 5 spice"" has no anise aroma that I can detect, which is one of the hallmarks of a normal ""5-spice"".  I suggest sampling before purchasing."
1.0,Product Rancid,"I have been purchasing this product from GNC and love it--my appetite was curbed and I had more energy, but not the bad jittery type of energy.  The product I received from Amazon was rancid and it looks like the seal was glued back on.  I had a co-worker compare the taste of the product I purchased from GNC and the product I received from Amazon, just to be sure, and she agreed that there was definitely something wrong with the juice I received from Amazon.  If you've never tried this juice, I would suggest you first purchase a bottle from GNC so you know how it's supposed to taste."
1.0,I think that I got a bad batch or they changed the ingredients,I tried an envelope from two different boxes and both didn't taste good to me at all. I've bought this in the grocery store before and always liked it and other betty crocker potatoes but either I got a bad batch from amazon or they changed the ingredients. I bought this in bulk for a fair price but I had to give the rest of the boxes away because I couldn't stand to eat them. Maybe another flavor won't be as bad but I won't waste my money buying it in bulk to find out.
5.0,Two Words......Time Machine!,I have been trying to find this cereal for years and i found it.  Its just as good as i remember it. I poured a bowl and it was like using a time machine it felt like i was 10 again! Thank You for bring me back to a good time!
5.0,KevinS,Usually buy this coffee at Costco. Best tasting coffee I've found for the size and price.Normally keep a second bag on hand so we don't run out.
1.0,Worst Orange Soda Ever,"They had this on special at a local market, so I thought I'd give it a try. The black licorice aftertaste was so powerful, it made it impossible to really taste anything else after the first sip. If I wanted to taste black licorice, I would have eaten some.  Terrible, terrible soda. Terrible, terrible experience. Threw the other five cans out. What a waste of money and potable water."
1.0,Terrible Product,"I received the Aerogarden as a gift. I have a green thumb and can grow anything. I looked forward to having fresh herbs to cook with. There are several things that make this product quite bad.  1.) The light is a beacon! The grow light has to be on 14-15 hours a day and is incredibly bright. This won't be a problem if you have a kitchen far away from your bedroom but if you have an apartment it will present a problem.  2.)It does not work. I tried once to grow the herbs exactly as instructed. It didn't work. The plants grew only a little bit and then died after a few weeks. I ordered more seed pods to try again, trouble shooted using the FAQ's on the Aerogarden website and again the plants grew a little bit and died. I am a gardener the product does not work.  3.)Complete lack of customer service. I called and emailed trying to get ahold of the company to tell them the product does not work and try to get some support. I got an auto reply from Aerogarden that said ""we are experiencing a high volume of emails and are currently 3 weeks behind in replying"" Well it has now been 2 months and I still have not heard a thing.  SAVE YOUR MONEY! This product does not work."
5.0,Efficacious for me,"I am a big fan of this product.  I love the grape flavor, but you should realize that (at least, right now) you can get the extra strength version for about the same price - just not in grape apparently.  There are some knock-offs that probably do the same thing, but there are also similar looking products with an entirely different toolkit of supplements.  I recommend trying this brand at least once.  Also, when trying this for the first time, start with just a sip and wait 15 minutes.  If you feel fine, have a bigger sip, working your way to half a bottle.  Once you build a tolerance, you can have up to two bottles a day apparently.  Tolerance seems to fall off after a few days for me.  I think if used wisely this is a healthful supplement, and the price is reasonable."
5.0,strong treat,"bought these for my friend who loves peppermint candy, he absolutely loves them, his wife says they are too strong for her, so more for him, having a ginger candy is also healthier then plain candy"
5.0,Missing the point,"I think perhaps that some of the previous reviewers are missing the point. These bars are ""live"" food as they are sprouted and not cooked. Hence they are easier to digest, contain all the natural enzymes that nature intended, and a are naturally wholesome! No they are not super sweet but they taste great nevertheless. In my opinion, it's the best bar out there. I can't stand all the other processed bars. They use lots of sugar to cover the dead and processed taste. And I absolutely love the fact that these bars are free from all the common food allergens!"
5.0,"Great Taste, Great Healthy Stuff!!","Looooooove this product!!! I've always been a fan of multi-fruit & vegetable drinks, and now I can say I make my own! I usually mix mine with almond milk and add a little sprinkle of stevia to add a little sweetness, but it's definitely palatable without! Gives me everything my body needs that sometimes I don't have time to give myself! My body feels well rounded and am seeing improvement with my skin!  Great product, highly recommended!!"
5.0,crunchy ginger,"A very crunchy ginger snap, with just the right amount of zing. A very versitile cookie, pie crust, toppings, or just eat right out of bag.An excellent wheat free, alternate for those missing the good old crunch of a spicy cookie."
1.0,Not so good,"Purchased this soda as it was sugar free and made from a renewable natural resource, stevia.  Very disappointed in the taste of the soda.  It was not sweet at all, the the ginger taste was weak to my taste buds.  The price is also very high compared to store purchased soda such as Seagrams or Canada Dry diet ginger ale.  I actually prefer the taste of the Canada Dry diet ginger ale to this product, and thus I will not be purchasing this again."
1.0,Terrible!,This horchata mix tastes nothing like horchata. There are  better alternatives if you want horchata.
1.0,The Spaghetti wasn't the Only Thing Soaked!,"Whole-wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.  One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!"
1.0,horrible,when i unpacked it from the box the plant was all shaken up and when i tried to feed it it wasnt closing. i took a closer look and realized that all of them were cut off and not connected to the stem.
5.0,Excellent alternative to decaf doffee,"Having had a medical need to give up decaf coffee, I have found the Gooe Earth Sweet and Spicy to be an excellent alternative.  The only downside is that it is difficult to find in stores.  Being able to order it on line was a real plus."
1.0,Not good,"The Smackaroos Diet Treats Garlic Lob Carb Crackers arrived in a baggie, not sealed and were stale"
1.0,"Poor Quality, Foreign-Made Brach's Candy","Candy was for the most part in melted and broken little bits and pieces.  I was having a hard time finding this product locally, so decided to go with this over-priced on-line merchandise. What a mistake!  Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have purchased Brach's candy that was of poor quality (but not from this merchant).  Part of the problem may stem from where it was made: stamped on the bag was "" MADE IN MEXICO.""  Thanks, Brach's for shipping American Jobs to foreign soil, so that you can make a little more profit by manufacturing a cheaper, lower quality product.  And, I'm not letting the  Merchant (Yagoozon) off the hook, for they could easily have seen the poor quality of the candy right through the clear plastic part of the bag.  Shame on the Merchant AND especially Brach's for such ""Corporopathic""  behavior!"
5.0,MMMM Sugar!,"Ordered 2 5 lbs bags, packaged well and shipped really fast from this company.  Works great in my restored candy machine.  Having the ad card to insert inside machine is nice as well."
1.0,The worst chips I've ever tasted!,"I just tasted my first Kaia-brand Sea Salt and Vinegar Kale Chips and truly, they were the worst chips I've ever tasted.  I should say ""chip"" rather than ""chips"" because one was my limit.  It was bitter and rancid-tasting and the bitterness stayed with me for hours.  I love kale and I love sea salt and vinegar, but Kaia ruined the combination for me."
1.0,not like sushi bar tea !!!!,"this has to be the worst green tea EVER .... dont believe this tea tastes anything like the hot green tea i get  at any sushi bar . dont order this tea if you want that taste .... i went ahead and ordered the brown rice tea i usually get ,its much better ."
1.0,where is the nutritional information from the side of the box?,"These look appealing, but without the detailed nutritional information and ingredients list, I would NEVER buy them, or any other food product on your website - unless, of course, I was already familiar with it."
1.0,Be careful,"I have never eaten flax before, and this last Saturday, I decided to add one teaspoon to my oatmeal.  After the first couple of bites, my throat started to feel weird, and felt like it was going to close.  With each bite, I started to feel worst and worst.  After eating less than half of the oatmeal, I poured it out.  I eat this oatmeal every day, plain, without flax.  No problem.  Next, I started feeling warm, my stomach was cramping, and I was puking.  I never get sick like this!!  I tried to call my doctor, but they were closed.  Thought I was going to die."
1.0,Awful,I like the soda stream and some flavors are just fine. Cherry Cola is awful. Throw some grenadine in the cola version and don't waste ur time on this one. It almost taste like it has a citrus flavor added. It's really undrinkable and how it passed quality control is astonishing.
5.0,Our favorite gravy - Great Price!,"We love this gravy - Found in store in the past, but was never able to find again. Lucked out and found it on Amazon and have been purchasing it ever since!"
1.0,disaster,"Innova Senior Dry Cat Food made my cat so sick,I thought she was dying.She had a very high fever and was clearly in pain.I had to run to the vet emergency room.Since then she is fading away.I do not recommend this brand of cat food to anyone  Dorota Matusiak"
1.0,Yikes! Gross,"Yikes, this flavor is gross.  It smells/tastes like a musty old basement.  Reminded me of summer camp in an old log cabin.  Avoid..."
1.0,Dead Tree,"Shipping was not the problem; the tree came nicely packaged. However, it was dead to begin with. The leaves were brown. Over the next couple of weeks, I watered the tree consistently, hoping I could revive it. The only thing that I was successfully growing in that pot was moss. The tree continued to look worse and worse. I'm positive that I didn't do anything wrong. I watered it every day, made sure it was getting plenty of sunlight, and even misted the leaves. I want either a new, LIVING tree, or my money back."
5.0,These are great!,"I will never buy regular pasta again...ok, that' not true. But these are a definite fave."
1.0,Ingredients Changed,"This product had an unannounced ingredient change. Chicken was added, which caused huge problems for my dog. The representative at Purina wrote back in response to my upset email to advise me they only changed the ingredients to the canned EN. Totally false statement. I had written down the 1st few ingredients in the beginning and I made a comparison when my dog got sick. Totally unacceptable!"
5.0,"Really Nice, Great Deal","From previous reviews I worried about huge variations in size, while there some different sizes (which is good), there are very few scrapy pieces. Quality looks very good, super deal, for a little more than you would pay for 2 pounds at Walmart, you get 5 pounds of better chips"
1.0,A lot of dirt,"This is not a great green tea. It contains a lot of dirt / powder that goes through the tea ball and makes the cup look like a suspension rather than an infusion. The taste is weak so one has to use a lot of this tea, which results in an over-caffeinated beverage. Finally, even the color of the tea itself is on the yellow side rather than green. Not a satisfactory purchase!"
5.0,Nice Food Gift.,Purchased as gift to neighbor.  She was pleased as this happened to be her favorite nut mix (she especially liked the cranberries).
5.0,The only one for us,"It took us trying about five different formulas before we got to this one. Now, it's the only thing we can feed our daughter without her spitting up 3-6 times after eating. Even the same fussiness and gas powder didn't work for us. ... It's either this or the concentrate, and they don't sell the concentrate on Amazon for a reasonable price. ... One last thing: This is a fantastic product, but if you have a Toys R Us/Babies R Us anywhere in your vicinity, it's worth driving to get the concentrate. It'll save you about $16 per two cases, which for us means about $8-10 per week. (One case of concentrate provides the same amount of food as two cases of ready to feed.)"
5.0,Good deal on a great item!,"Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!  And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.  So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day."
1.0,AWEFUL,"I thought this would be wonderful because I love nuttela!  Let me tell you this is a terrible product.  I have never had a nut butter that was so bad.  Even the natural peanutbutter I tried wasn't this bad.  First let me say if your looking for a Nuttela like product, buy Nuttela.  This product tastes like they took peanut shells, added water, oil, and a pinch of poor quality chocolate put it in a blender and pulsed it twice.  The texture is gritty at best, I swear they used shells not nuts!  Horrible, thew it away immediately."
1.0,A Big Bag of Grass,"I have tried several of the premix bases for dog food. My dog is on a raw diet. When this bag of premix arrived, I was terribly disappointed. It was like receiving a bag of mulched grass. There was very little fruits or vegetables as claimed on the label. It smells like a bag of fresh cut hay. From the look and smell, it's almost all alfalfa. There are other premixed bases available that are much better. I am mixing it with other mixes to make it more appealing to my dog."
5.0,Reunion Island is a fine coffee,"Reunion Island SWP decaf is a nice, bold tasting decaf coffee. Drinking it you would be hard pressed to tell that it is a decaf and not a regular coffee. Just note that this is for pod coffee makers, like the Bunn MCP, Bunn My Cafe, Opod, Senseo and others. This is not for K-Cup or T-Disk makers like the Keurig or Tassimo. Some single-serve pod coffee makers may have a hard time with this coffee, as it is a 10 oz pod, whereas the standard seems to be 8 oz or less. This pod is problematic in Senseo makers, as they have a shallower pod holder. These will work fine in the Bunn or Opod makers."
5.0,What Can I Say,We are hooked on these crackers.  Will never go back to wheat crackers.  So tasty and so much lower in calories.
5.0,Hodgson Mill White Bread,"I am so totally satisfied by Hodgson Mill products & I probably have purchased > 100 loaves at this point.  I used some as a present to my brother with good results, too.  Never have I seen ""old"" smelling mix nor have I ever had a yeast failure.  Their taste & texture is wonderful. Never have I had a ""slicing failure"" where you can't get a slice to hold together long enough to lay it down. The different types lend themselves well to adding ingredients such as Chopped Nuts or Sesame Seeds or Millet Seed or - - use your own imagination.  Coming in nice units of 6 loaves makes pantry storage easy, and once opened, the carton yields 6 boxes with ""Best By"" dates easily accessible on each so rotating your shelf stock is almost ""goof-proofed"".  Next time you walk a grocery store, note the prices there! Here again, I think you really can't beat the quality with a really fair price that Hodgson provides.  It seems to me that they have expended great effort to have the best product they can produce & the best shipping available for their customers.  Buy with great confidence based on my experiences with them during the last 2-3 years.  I hope this helps decision making."
1.0,Do not buy this!,I bought this because it was 75% off...bad decision!  I should have paid more attention to the reviews. It does taste like cigarette ashes and definitely not worth to try!  THis is the worst loose leaf tea that I have ever tasted and I am no amateur to teas!  Run with your penny and stay away!  Not worth giving this benefit of the doubt!
1.0,Horrible waste of packaging. Very expensive.,"This is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen. The wastefulness of this packaging is incredible. By buying this item you are contributing to filling of landfills, environmental destruction, and overwhelming inefficiency. Furthermore, on a per-ounce basis this item is considerably more expensive than cheese in large canisters. Avoid this silly product if you care about the environment or your wallet!"
1.0,Not what I ordered,"I know this should be a review of the actual product, but I want people to be aware of my situation. I normally trust amazon and would recommend most products through amazon.com. However, the condition I received this box of treats was unacceptable. I purchased what I believed to be a new, unopened box of dog treats, but what I received was an open box with tape all around the sides, including where the ""tear here"" tab was torn off. I can't tell if any treats are missing, but this is definitely not a ""new"" box of treats."
5.0,Great Taste !,"Rosemary is nothing like Peppermint ! As it has much more subtle taste ! At a Tablespoon in 20 oz. of drinking water it is still not harsh, kind of mild ! According to Miracle Food Cures from the Bible it is supposed to help with memory and old age ! It's easy to imagine Rosemary Chicken ! Over seasoning would be hard to do ! This great stuff as it has been around a long time ! Thank You !!!!"
5.0,Great tea,"My husband's favorite loose green tea.  He drinks every morning, and it is a little better price than from Stash."
5.0,THE GREATEST CANDY EVER CREATED,"I'm one of those people who wakes up in the middle of the night to scavenge the cupboards for sweet things, and this is undoubtedly my sweet of choice.  There's simply nothing better on the candy marketplace than this masterfully concocted product, so be glad that the owners and creators have found a way to bring it to the masses.  Given their emphasis on small batch quality over quantity, it can be hard to find in a lot of grocery stores, but now anyone with a computer can rightfully gorge themselves.  I've emailed the folks at Funley's via their website to inquire as to whether they're putting actual crack in the little treats (as they're so damn addicting), but they just say that the only thing in there is ""fun, love and chocolate-y goodness"".  Sounds like they're trying to protect their recipe, but who can blame them."
1.0,WONT RISE,Baked several of thier mixes in their machine and it will not rise.  Sadly all were yucky.  I was hoping for a real bread like product.  I could not recommend this to anyone.
1.0,Frozen tree,Ordered as a gift for family in Chicago.It will not be bringing any good fortune as I'm told the plant arrived frozen and nearly dead. Returned. Now waiting for refund. Waste of time and money.
1.0,Maybe my taste buds are different.,"I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was ""yuck"" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything."
5.0,Just like that ones my dad used in the 1950's,"It is strong and heavy duty, but reasonably priced. However, I have not yet caught a mole. I am looking forward to that."
5.0,Success!!!,"We brought home a young female cat from the local shelter. Poor little one had runny poop when we got her and couldn't even make it into the litter box in time. She also ate like she was starving all the time and when she went outside we couldn't stop her from eating every weed she could find. Luckily when researching ""runny cat poop"" I found the reviews on this cat food. I'm so very glad to report that after slowly switching her food to this over a period of 10 days, she is now having regular bowel movements. Oh my, what a relief! I never thought the highlight of this year would be finding solid cat poop when cleaning the litter!!! And our other cat loves this food too - a double blessing. Hope it works for your cat too if it has this problem."
1.0,Rip Off Price for Crystal Lite,"I was deceived. I was looking thru crystal lite  selections and found most of the offers were for 4 packages of 4 packs which gives you 16 containers. For about $39, which would cost about the same in supermarket.  So without reading one ad  real close I order a four pack and that is what I got 4 containers not a 4 pack of 4 for 16--- for $39 cost in supermarket $10.  For $39 I thought I was buying a four pack of 4 packs a total of 16 cans. Which sell for about $2.50 each in supermarket. instead I got only 1 four pack which at the rate they are charging is almost $10 each--4 times the supermarket price."
1.0,Good product - Purchase locally for freshness!,"My husband and I are runners and have tried many ""energy booster"" nutritional products.  This one (orange) is my husband's favorite for taste and consistency. (It is WAY too sweet for me.  I prefer the cherry flavor.)  We can highly recommend the product itself.  However, while we are loyal Amazon.com shoppers (too loyal! LOL), do not purchase this product here.  We ordered two cases in anticipation of a heavy race season and they arrived REEKING of cigarette smoke.  The smell was nauseating.  As it was an edible item, it is not eligible for return so into the garbage it went.  Buy locally."
1.0,Awful,"This was the second brand of ""green drink"" that I've tried, and I'm very thankful that it was. If it had been my first experience with a green drink, I would have given up drinking them immediately. This stuff is awful! I have to literally hold my breath and force myself to drink it. Not only does it taste terrible, but it contains lots of small particles that irritate my throat making me want to cough. In addition, there is always a sizable amount of material left at the bottom of the glass, even though I stir it every time I take a drink. This is the berry flavored version of this product, but it doesn't have a hint of berry flavor. I'm also thankful that I only bought a small size container, and I will definitely be going back to my original brand (Trader Joe's) after I finish all of this one. If I can finish all of this one, that is."
1.0,Flat Taste,"Nothing compares to the satisfaction of drinking plain water. Just a tinge of mint - flat taste, Waste of money. All 89 reviews so far have given 5 star, makes me very suspicious."
1.0,Cheapest Wasabi on Amazon - yet still (amazingly) overpriced!,"Boy was this a mistake!  Ordered two bottles of this stuff.  It's not as dry as the wasabi one normally gets in a sushi place.  Guess they had to add more vinegar to get it to squirt out the ultra cheap ""bottle"".  In truth, the ""bottle"" is more like a plastic bag.  I like a fair bit of wasabi on my sushi, a bit more than the standard amount some folks would put on.  When I use the amount to get the heat I like from this brand, it makes my sushi taste sour!  I think it might be the vinegar or whatever other thining agent they use.  Regardless, this is a poor imitation of wasabi (yeah I know, most of the stuff is just basically dyed horseradish, but this stuff is not even that good).  OTOH it does pack a punch.  It might even be slightly hotter than normal."
1.0,brown paper bag?,"Should've read the other reviews...disappointed.  Appears to be a lot of the same...8 of one type and one or two of another.  Not what I was expecting, especially due to the fact they were shipped in a brown paper bag."
5.0,"Rich, complex, delicious, very pure ingredients and low in caffeine:  what's not to love?","I consume a lot of this tea on a daily basis while at work.  If you are trying to find a good coffee substitute, this is great because it is very low in caffeine, yet very strong, rich and complex in flavor.  I am sensitive to caffeine, yet this tea does not get me too wired.  It does, however, give me a gentle jazzy infusion of energy.  My personal fave thing to do, tea-wise, is to COMBINE a bag of this kukicha tea with a bag of pure peppermint tea (I favor Celestial Seasonings Pure Peppermint, which has peppermint as the sole ingredient and it is a very strong peppermint) and let them steep together:  VUNDERBAR!  You get a tea with unexpected chocolate overtones that is very delicious, strong and complex.  But back to the straight Haiku kukicha experience:  to sum up, if you are looking for a strong, pure (organic, as a matter of fact) green tea that is heavy on depth and flavor and low in caffeine, you have found it.  ENJOY!"
1.0,Diet lover's delite,"I should have read the product description better. The artificial sweetner in the Lemon Lime mix creates a drink along the lines of Diet Sprite (or other lemon limey diet drinks). If you like diet lemon lime, then it's probably fine. I don't."
1.0,Used to be good,I've ordered salmon jerky from Snackmasters before and really liked their product but it was a couple years ago. I recently ordered a package from them again. The jerky was so hard it was like chewing leather. I don't mind my jerky on the harder side but my jaw hurt after a couple pieces. I also found fish bones in my jerky which I think is unacceptable especially for the cost of the product.
5.0,Green Tea-Decaffeinated,"I prefer my green tea decaffeinated so that I can enjoy a cup in the evening. I was purchasing this brand at my local supermarket and was glad to find it on Amazon for a much better price, enabling me to purchase in bulk since I also brew it by the pitcher in my iced tea maker. Delicious also!"
5.0,Yellow flavorful yummy missing from your popcorn?  Order this!,"When you go to the movie theater, the popcorn comes coated yellowish and golden.  You love the taste so much that you pick out the yellowist most flavorful kernels and eat them first. You've made popcorn at home, both on-the-stove and the microwave type, and it is missing ""something"".  This popcorn isn't missing anything.  From the tropical based oils to the carefully measured popcorn salt, this has it all.  It tastes exactly like the popcorn you get at the theater.  I've read a few complaints here that this popcorn is too salty.  I don't agree.  In fact when I make it, I add the full amount of oil and salt but withhold about 1/4 of the kernels to amplify the salty greasiness.  When I pop this corn the entire house fills up with that awesome ""movie theater"" popcorn smell but without that nasty microwave undertone.  The price was great, the product rocks, the shipping (even to Alaska!) was free, I can't really think of any constructive criticism for this product.  I don't  have a popcorn kettle, and the instructions on each package shows how to pop this rockstar either on the stove, with an air popper, in a kettle, etc.  So long as the free shipping applies, I will be ordering this product again and again and again."
1.0,worst flavor coffee ever,"I have had there French Vanilla and really enjoyed it. Whatever this product is i do not know. It has a strong Chemical smell that is over powering before you even get a chance to taste it. it reminds me of a high school chemistry lab.  I tasted this coffee hoping maybe it would only smell, i even closed my nose to get a taste trying to forgo the smell. I drowned it with syrup pumps. I used coffee mate till it was pale NOTHING HELPED!  I havn't thrown away the k cups yet but i cant figure i will ever use them... unforgeablely i moved all the kcups from the original box once i got them so i never tried to return them  DO NOT BUY THIS PLAVOR.. Gloria Jean in general is not bad though"
1.0,Crap- So hard couldnt cut with a meat clever,I have little yorkies so I generally take products like this and cut into smaller portions.  This stuff was so hard if you tried to snap in half it crumbles away a big portion of the piece. I finally put it on a cutting board and when I tried to cut with a meat clever I got scared the knife was gonna slip sideways.  The pieces still crumbled.  I mean we are talking serious dry. This product is touted as quality and american.  This product is much more expensive yet is the worst I've ever purchased.  It is like it was outdated.  Do not buy this product.  It is poor value
5.0,Smooth.....,Absolutely no after taste with these soft-gels. I do believe that the quality is top-notch. I would recommend them to a close friend.
5.0,How can you go wrong?,Great Food! Great Price with subscribe and save saved 15% of the list price.  3 boxes go fast but they are good.
5.0,A superior coffee,"I am rather hard to please with 'straight' (unflavored) coffee.  I don't like any bitterness, nor too strong a taste, but yet want a rich coffee flavor that can stand up to a large mug.  I've found this Kenyan AA to have all the qualities that make a satisfying morning coffee.  To me, it tastes like really good coffee is supposed to.  I've tried many types of K cup coffees and this is always the one I come back to.  I enjoy flavored coffees for later in the day, but my first morning cup needs to be 'pure' and to me, this is as pure and rich as it comes.  If it were wine, it would be called smooth and full-bodied.  If it were chocolate, it would be semi-sweet.  In fact, it reminds me of chocolate because of the roundness of its flavor.  For those who like 'rocket fuel' type coffee, this will seem too mild, but to the coffee drinker who prefers medium or even light roast coffee and wants something deeply satisfying, this really fits the bill.  Now, if only Amazon would sell it in those big 'frustration free' boxes.  I'd sure buy it.  Highly recommended."
1.0,BEWARE! Contains MSG.,"The bottle says ""No MSG"" but this is actually false advertising. 1. In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate. 2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG. 3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG. 4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).  Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.  Why not just remove ""No MSG"" from the package instead of misleading people?  This is really an unethical practice.  I felt very disappointed and mislead when I discovered this.  Don't just take my word for it; go learn about the ingredients on the list."
1.0,IMHO nasty-tasting,"Being an avid peanut butter lover, I chose this product with enthusiasm, which was short-lived. IMHO this product has an annoyingly cloying sweet flavor and no peanut butter flavor whatosever. I threw it in the trash after one taste."
1.0,Awful,Tried the Miso today. Disgusting. I like Miso but this mess was very sour and smelly. Unfortunately I bought 2 of these and now have to find an unsuspecting victim to dump the other one
1.0,Extremely disappointing product - Mothers Beware - the first ingredient is apple juice,"My son has typically loved the Sprout foods and is a very good eater - with the exception of this oatmeal with roasted cinnamon applesauce product.  The product is extremely disappointing as the first and main ingredient is Apple Juice and not real apples (though apples do follow in the ingredient's list).  Due to the juice content, the consistency and flavor of this product does not match the other baby foods that have whole foods in the ingredients.  The product tastes more liquidy with the taste of apple juice, and my son refused to eat it.  When reviewing the baby food options, I strongly recommend that you consider another selection and not waste your money."
5.0,Great Taste and Good for Health,"This is our favorite cereal! It is low in sugars, tastes great, and is very good for your health. We highly recommend it."
1.0,burnt,"I was so hoping that the other reviews were wrong and these wouldn't taste burnt. But, allas they are a dark dark brown color and 95% of the 2 bags i opened were brunt and nasty. Amazon was GREAT though. They refunded the money and I will give them to the food shelf."
5.0,The best truffle I've ever had,"These were passed around work and I must say they are the best chocolate truffle I've ever had.  Makes it hard to look at Lindnor the same again.  I've always thought the sweeter the better, but I was surprised by how good these were and they are not super sweet.  I'm on here about to buy some based on the few I had at work!"
1.0,worst experience with delivered flowers ever,"I have never had a worse experience with delivered flowers.  It started out when placing the order...  The previous times I ordered flowers through Amazon, I was given options to select the delivery date, as well as what to say on the card.  This vendor had no such options.  During the order process I was informed it would take 1 to 3 business days.  Since I was ordering in advance, 1 to 3 days was enough.  3 days would be on-time, and one day would make my wife happy as she would get to enjoy them for the whole week...  4 days after placing the order, the tracking status shows that the delivery estimate was changed to 2 to 10 days.  Worse, the tracking info indicated the shipper (fedex) was holding the order back, but I could go pick it up if I wanted.  Keep in mind that I'm shipping it to an office building that gets fed-ex shipments daily.  Apparently they shipped with a super-low-priority option allowing the shipper to delay the shipment.  Sure, I could go pick them up 35 miles away at the FedEx warehouse, and drive to the opposite side of town to deliver them myself...  Of course the reason I ordered delivered flowers was because I wanted to pay someone else to deliver them for me.  I wouldn't mail-order flowers that I can buy at the grocery store, if I planned to deliver them myself.  So here I sit, a week after I placed the order, wondering if they might be delivered soon...  With amazon telling me that, for sure, they will be there by next week.  So what kind of condition will roses be in after a week and a half being tossed around in a cardboard box?  And I paid for this?  There are 123 florists in this town, and they all are affiliated with 1 or more florist delivery networks.  So getting flowers delivered fresh from a florist should never need to involve Fed-ex.  But I guess I get what I paid for, if I wanted real service, I should have paid a real florist for real florist service (or do it myself).  I'm sure that my bad experience is partially because of my own high expectations from having used flower services for the last 20 years, always getting next day (or same day) delivery of my orders.  The last time Amazon forced me into 2-day delivery expectations, which was ok as that was explained up-front and I got exactly that.  But this time I was promised 1-3 days before I was charged, then promised 2-10 days after it was too late to make a different choice.  That is called bait and switch.  Perhaps the delivery estimate provided by Amazon is not based on the original representation in the shopping card, but that wouldn't matter if the item had arrived on time.  Perhaps it is all FedEx's fault...  But that is what is being sold, so the delivery service is part of what is being sold...  So even if the seller is blame-free for my poor experience, it is the sum of my experience with the vendor AND the delivery service that counts toward my ability to enjoy my purchase.  I would suggest avoiding this vendor.  Use vendors that are part of a reputable florist network."
5.0,Sweeeeeet!,"I like this blackberry pomegranate iced green tea almost as much as I liked the mango pineapple. It's also full of flavor, very sweet and has only 5 calories and 10mg of caffeine per 8 ounce serving.  Ingredients: honey granules (sugar, honey) citric acid (provides tartness), green tea powder, hibiscus extract, sucralose (sweetner), maltodextrin (corn), natural flavor, blackberry juice solids, isomalt, soy lecithin, pomegranate juice solids.  Simply delicious and I appreciate that it's low in sugar and carbs."
1.0,extremely salty,"I just added 2 tbsp to the dish and it turned out to be very salty. I am not sure how else I can use this product. Will search for any good recipe that can go with this and will update this review, until then it is a waste."
1.0,Worst Dates in the World,"These dates would not have been BOUGHT by residents in the Middle East.  They were small.  Most had the consistency of the rawhide leather chew toys we give our dogs.  Many pits remain, and since these are so old, hard. and stale, they must be soaked in hot liquid for a while to use for baking.  Because there are so many pits and that nubby end thing, one must dissect and snip with scissors every single date into baking-size pieces.  Awful!!  I bet the Bergin Nut Company was chuckling when I ordered so many of their awful dates.  Yuck!!"
5.0,simply the best,"These tasty and chewy naturally tree ripened mangoes are definitely the best I've had. Somewhat expensive, but you get what you pay for."
1.0,Product of China - Owner Beware,"I bought these without first realizing where they were made.  Upon receipt I noticed the ""Product of China"" on the bag and immediately threw them out.  I don't trust any product of China for my dog!"
1.0,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,Our family dog died a few days ago because of this bone.  DO NOT BUY THIS DOG CHEWY!  The bone became lodged in the dog's throat and he suffocated.  Within in minutes the dog passed away.  There was nothing we could do though we tried.  We loved our dog.  I hope this review might keep others from going through the loss of a beloved pet.  DO NOT BUY THIS!  The risk is to high.
1.0,smokehouse chicken breast strips,"I bought the smokehouse chicken breast strips because they were made in the U.S.A. They are so hard, my dog cannot chew them, and if I break them (which is hard to do), I am afraid she will choke on them. There are not very many ""strips"", mostly pieces.  It is a wasted $22.99, as I will not give them to her. How can you sell something so dangerous."
1.0,Ribbon candy?,"This crap showed up as candy FLAKES and in a million pieces..Manufacture did not intend this to be shipped using our government handling...USPS! Dont expect to receive as advertised ""Ribbon"" shaped candy but expect Pieces and Bits!"
5.0,One of the greatest coffee's ever!,"I love Kauai Coffee Company! The coffee is so smooth and delicious. The cost is also very nice. The closest thing I have tasted to Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee but at $60/lb., you're best bet is Kauai Coffee! Don't pay more than $6.61 though. Walmart now sells Kauai Coffee for .66 cent/oz (12oz bag for $8)"
5.0,Great coffee !!,"I love huckleberries and luckily, the first huckleberry coffee I tasted was wonderful !!  Usually I do not like flavored coffee, so huckleberry coffee is an exception.  Unfortunately, some I have had after that have been disappointing after the first delightful one I tasted.  This one did not disappoint, and I am so glad I ordered it !! Highly recommended for any coffee lover that wants a different, delicious flavor !!"
1.0,packing was too poor,"I place  order two times. First order, honey was leaking everywhere in the box. They are going to replacement. Yesterday I got second order, box was broken and honey was leaking again. I order 12 bottles (it was heavy) , but they use thin box and packed too poor. I like the honey, but packing was too poor."
5.0,Vanished quickly,"I bought these for my kids.  I'm not fond of strawberry, so I can't comment directly on them, but they sure vanished quickly.  I think that says it all."
1.0,"Great movie, terrible DVD","I am continually amazed at the shoddy treatment that some movies get in their DVD release.  This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is.  I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style. This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters. My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less."
1.0,"Great machine, lousy coffee","On a recent trip to Holland I had the opportunity to experience your excellent Senseo coffee.  I liked it so much that upon my return to Seattle I immediately checked for the machine's availability in the United States and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.com.  Last week I bought the Senseo machine along with four boxes of medium roast decaffeinated pods.  I also received one package of regular medium roast and one package of mild roast with the Senseo machine.   To my horror all of the coffee I received is a very poor substitute of the Douwe Egberts coffee I enjoyed so much in Holland. The coffee that was delivered to me is weak and tasteless.  In fact, to get halfway decent coffee I have to use two pods for one four-ounce cup. This is unacceptable not only from the point of view of expense, it also limits the use of the machine to one four-ounce serving at the time.    I request that you provide Senseo coffee machine users here with the same quality coffee you sell in Holland (at $16.99 for a four-pack of pods it is more than twice as expensive here, which I'm willing to pay only if the coffee is of the same superior quality).  Starbucks is a huge success in this country because it sells real coffee, not some watered-down version of the real thing.  Until I receive quality coffee to substitute for the poor coffee I now have, I will tell my friends, neighbors, colleagues and anybody else who might be interested not to invest in the Senseo machine.  In the meantime I would be happy to return the coffee to you because I have no use for it.  Please let me know when and how you expect to remedy this situation.  If I do not hear from you within a week or so I will return the Senseo machine and the remaining unused portion of the coffee to Amazon.com for a full refund.  I look forward to hearing from you."
1.0,No Flavor!,"We've enjoyed lots of Good Earth Original sweet and spicy tea, but the stuff I received from Amazon.com is nothing like it!  Good Earth tea is naturally sweet and spicy, delicious -- but the case I ordered from Amazon.com is tasteless, like drinking a cup of plain hot water!  I noticed that the freshness date is still good, but I also noticed that the papers attached to the tea bag strings are dark and sticky.  I think that this case of tea was not stored properly, and perhaps it was exposed to too much dampness or climate change?  The little paper labels, which each have a unique inspirational verse, were almost illegible.  Unfortunately I can't return the tea, so I think I will let the Good Earth tea manufacturers know about it.  Perhaps it was an error made on the part of the manufacturers."
1.0,Too weak to be called a concentrate,"The reviews for this product are confusing and not accurate.  Mr. Wu, says this is 13.6% Triclopyr which is incorrect since the manufacturer clearly says ""Active Ingredients: Triclopyr, triethylamine salt: 0.8%"".  Also the description calls this a  ""concentrate"" yet there is no information about how much working solution this so-called concentrate makes.  The description also says ""convenient no mix formula"" which implies it is used right out of the bottle so it can't be a concentrate.  Again Mr. Wu says he uses 50 to 100% stronger mix, but this can't be a description of this product since it is a no mix formula and any mixing would reduce the concentration, i.e., there is no way to make it stronger.  It appears that Mr. Wu has pasted his description of another product into the space for this one and that is not helpful.  So it appears that this is NOT a concentrate, but a ready to use solution that is less than 1%.  Very misleading."
1.0,TERRIBLE taste!  Way off the mark!  Zero stars.,"This was absolutely disgusting! I threw it out after just 1 taste. Do these companies even research or 'taste test' these products before they release them to the public?  I've had many creamy tomato pasta sauces over the years, and this one tasted bitter and bland at the same time.  It should be sweeter with the taste of cream too.  Back to the drawing board Con Agra!"
1.0,SUPPLIER TAKE NOTE: This is an error on your part.,You will never sell anything at 10X the supermarket price. Do you proofread your own ads??????
1.0,coffee bean caffeine eye cream,"I am extremely disappointed in this product.  It didn't come with directions, when I first tried to get any of this out of the tube the right way, the bottom of the plastic tube broke open, so I could never use this properly, and the bags under my eyes are just as big as before.  I would never recommend this to anyone, and I wonder if it worked for other women who bought it because of The Dr Oz show."
1.0,This is not grown by the Amish,"I don't believe this brand is an Amish brand, they just have the name ""Amish Country"". It's misleading."
1.0,dog food tastes better,"I knew taste is subjective, reading all the praises to this cereal here, but not by that much. It is the worst raisin bran I've ever tasted.  The first box I ever bought, we had to throw it away as no one would eat it.  The other day, I asked my husband to pick up some raisin bran (we only eat organic)from a store, instructing not to get the brown box - I did not remember the brand name.  Sure enough he comes home with this new box, which isn't brown anymore *eye roll*.  I just took a spoonful and couldn't even swallow it.  New look, same awful taste.  I don't know if cascadian farms raisin bran is available where you guys all live, but you should really give it a try. Heck, the store-brand organic raisin bran tastes better than this one."
5.0,better than mmf!,"I used this fondant for the first time to cover a two layer cake. It took blue food coloring gel very well, was pliable, easily handled, rolled thin, and worked wonderfully for my purposes. I had used marshmallow fondant in the past and it came out very lumpy on the cake- and was a pain to make. This was so much easier and looked much more smooth. I also bought at Michaels with a 40 percent off coupon. The best part was, my guests actually enjoyed it! The taste was definitely sweet, but not offensive as some premade fondants are rumored to be, and tasted better than the MMF!"
1.0,Vegetable oil?,"I'm surprised at the good reviews... maybe there are quality control problems.... I purchased some this week and I find it bear very little resemblance to Almond butter. When I opened the jar I smelled oil, vegetable oil, not almonds or any kind of nut. There was a very large amount of oil on the top (more than I have ever seen on Almond butter), stirring it was a lot more work than mixing Laura Scudder's Natural, I had to parcel it out into smaller containers and mix in stages. Once mixed it does not taste like Almond butter, it is still predominately oily. The ingredients do not acknowledge other added oils, but I would be willing to bet on it... I'd advise, try other brands, Trader Joe's for one, tastes and spreads like Almond butter.  it only got one star because I can't give less..."
5.0,Best root beer on the planet!,I have not indulged in soda for years because I refuse to partake in aspartame and have to avoid excess sugar. Finally we of similar bent have a choice! This is not a 'settle for' choice by any means! This root beer has the best flavor I have encountered. I recommend this product to everyone who wants to enjoy soda in a more natural state.  Thanks for such a great product!
1.0,DAB Nutrition sent expired chips,DAB Nutrition sent chips that had already been expired for two days when shipped.  They must buy these cheap and resell them.  They are off my trusted seller list.
5.0,Delicious,"This is a nice, light, refreshing carbonated fruit juice. It's something like Orangina, but far more natural-tasting -- which makes sense, because unlike Orangina, it's all juice and has no added sweetener.  My only complaint is that the 8.3 ounce can is rather small; I generally prefer a larger drink. It's definitely not a bargain if you have to drink two cans at a time."
1.0,These Made My Lab Sick,"I ordered these after using the other C.E.T. Enzymatic Chews for over aa year with no problems. The HEXtras are not the same, they made my Yellow Lab sick, over and over . Beware of this possible side effect."
5.0,Pamelas fluor you can do anything with it!,"I've had been using Pamela's Fluor since 4 years. My family loved the wafles, pancakes and cookies made with this fluor.Give it a try it, and sure you will love it."
1.0,Red dye in cat food ruins carpeting - don't buy,"Made the big mistake of buying Meow-Mix.  Cat vomited (as all cats sometimes due) after eating Meow-Mix. Unfortunately the cat vomited on carpet. Usually unfortunate but no big deal - just clean it up. WRONG! Meow-Mix has red food dyes that will not come out - even if you start cleaning right after the event. We have tried three different cleaners and a carpet machine. We still have two big red/pink stains in the carpet.  I called the MeowMix customer service number and asked for some help on how to clean their red dye out of the carpeting. They told me to use a carpet cleaner - Really? Wow. Insightful.  I asked them why they put in apparently un-cleanable red dye in the cat food when they know cats are virtually color blind (for reds apparently) and when the cat pukes it is going to ruin their customers carpet. They said market research indicated the human buyers prefer to see a red, meaty, color and their was nothing they could do about it.  Yeah, how about not putting the red dye in or using another red dye?  Through almost and entire 25lb bag of MeowMix out in the trash and purchased Iams which is no issue to clean up.  Thanks for reading. Don't buy MeowMix unless you live outdoors ."
5.0,Bread Dipping Variety Pack,Great gift or to use at home. It is used weekly if not more at my house! Great flavors! My  family loves it!
1.0,Pro Flower is Pro Hate,"Simply will not do business with a company that supports hate speech.  See Rush Limbaugh.  How could I continue to send flowers to people I care about, when they will be thinking about Rush Limbaugh, the woman hater when the flowers arrive."
5.0,Easy weekday meal,"This is my go to chicken dish. Quick easy tasty and very simple to embellish. I have added every type of vegetable to this at one time or another, plus lots of different proteins. Think of it as a nice quality curry sauce that doesn't take up a lot of room on the shelf and use it as a base for your imagination."
1.0,Tastes like lightly flavored water,It tasted like slightly flavored watered down coconut water. I've had coconut water before and it tasted much better. I did not like it.
1.0,Not Something I Would Spend Money On,"I like the version of this cereal that is made by the competitor of this cereal and eat it periodically. I tried this hoping to find a very similar product that I could buy on sale if the other wasn't. The other option was a cereal that was so different that it would  become a new option for me.  The taste was adequate. The nuts were almost nonexistent....at least to the naked eye. They may have been rolled in dust, but there were definitely no pieces on the side of the cereal.  The color of the cereal was awful, reminding me of the color of what babies leave in a used diaper. It was not at all appealing. In addition, there is a lot of sugar in this cereal.  For the above reasons, I wouldn't bother to buy this in the future."
5.0,"Great product, great service","I have used this vanilla for 40 years.  My supply has always come directly from visiting Mexico or from a friend visiting in Mexico.  This is the first time I have had to order online.  I am thrilled to say my experience was wonderful -- the product is exactly as I was expecting and was very carefully packaged, arriving in a timely manner.  I would highly recommend this source for Mexican vanilla.  The price was good and the shipping was reasonable."
5.0,Good substitute for home made stock,"I have tried several chicken soup seasoning bases, looking for one that would give me a rich chicken taste without overloading the recipe with salt. The Vogue product is the best of the ones I have tried.  I do also keep a supply of the home made stock when I cook poultry, but I don't bother so much with that anymore because this product is such a good substitute.  In addition to using it for the most obvious chicken-flavored dishes, I frequently add a teaspoon to various sauces and gravies -- just enough to add some depth to the mixture, but not enough to make it taste like chicken soup."
5.0,Dog loves them,"I like that it's over a pound of treats, they are a good size and easy for my chihuahua to eat. I bought these because my chihuahua is a little overweight and these seem healthy and low fat. My chihuahua Trouble eats them gladly and fast."
5.0,Wonderful cinnamon oil,I loved this cinnamon oil.  I used it for cinnamon taffy and it turned out fantastic. Some cinnamon oils taste more like cloves. I would recommend it to anyone looking for that true cinnamon flavor.
5.0,Best grape soda ever! --but not worth buying online :(,"This is my favorite grape soda.. it's super fizzy (it stays fizzy long after opening too!) and taste like japanese grape gum! SO DELISH!!!  As much as I love this soda, I wouldn't fork out the money to buy this online... it's ridiculous at $3.52/bottle. The marble version, while ""neat"" loses its novelty fairly quickly. cost-wise, the marble version, isn't worth a repeat buy and you're better off just buying the 500ml can or the 12oz can,  especially if you're really thirsty. (also, for some reason, the can/bottles ones seem to taste better than the marble ones o_O  if you're lucky enough to be near the seramonte dai so, they have the 500ml tin bottles for $1.50/$1 and the one in downtown san francisco one has the 12oz cans for 2/$1.50 i'd wait. or go to an asian market that sells the marble versions to find the soda and try to see if they don't have the can bottle/versions.  but, if you got money to burn, or you're crazy the soda thAT badly, go for it!"
1.0,NOT worth the money..make your own!,"We were given this product as a gift. OK, I can forgive the fact that I'm a pastry chef and I was given a MIX for a gift :-0 but I have always made my own frosting from scratch and have for years. It's one of the EASIEST things to make!!! Make your cake from a mix if you want but....I looked at the back of this box to see what was in it and...SERIOUSLY it's just powdered sugar (.80 cents worth), salt (.05 cents worth) and vanilla (maybe 20 cents worth). I mean, I 'm glad that this small company is making themselves some money but really you should spend your money on other more difficult to make items. (Or all the medical bills that come along with the issues of gluten allergy.)    Honestly folks here is all you do for AWESOME frosting:  1 box (16 oz) of powdered sugar (put it in a bowl)  1 pinch salt (put it in the bowl  1 teaspoon vanilla (in the bowl)  1 Cup margarine  (at room  temp,in the bowl)  4 TBL soy milk or other milk (in the bowl) Mix it all up with a mixer till it is light and fluffy (about 5 minutes)   ...if you want chocolate add 4 tbl of cocoa powder and another tbl of milk"
1.0,TASTES HORRIBLE!!,"I bought this after most of the reviews said it did not have a bitter taste. THey are WRONG! The bitter taste comes through in my super strong coffee, so much so that I had to throw it out and use regular sugar. Don't waste your money unless you like gross tasting sweeteners."
1.0,waste of money,The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
1.0,What A Terrible Idea,"Whoever it was over at Crystal Light thought this was a good idea should be fired.We drink alot of Crystal Light around our house, mostly the lemonade.  I picked this Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita up as a change of pace.  What a horrible mistake.  This tastes just awful.  It tastes vaguely like a margarita but the overwhelming flavor is salt.  Drinking this flavor just makes you thirstier.  And with each passing sip, this stuff begins to taste worse and worse.  It is terrible.  Maybe if you used this thing as a mixer and added some tequila or vodka to it, maybe it wouldn't taste so god awful.  But I'm not gonna try.  This stuff is terrible.  DO NOT BUY.  Ugh."
1.0,Do not feed your dog chicken jerky products,"My dog got really sick from eating this product.  Vomiting for days and had to take him to emergency room.  There have been 1000s documented cases of illness and death from chicken jerky products.  search for articles on this issue.  I can't believe this has not been recalled.  I'm glad i caught it before he got really sick, but there have been many documented cases of death now.  I don't want to see any more dogs get sick or die from these products."
1.0,Popcorn bad enough to spoil your movie and entire evening,"You'll probably be more satisfied if you pick dried up corn kernels out of a pig's trough and throw them in your fireplace for popcorn.  I bought several boxes of this product and wasn't able to pop a single adequate bag.  I tried removing the popcorn from the microwave after an entire scale of different time periods, and every single time, either the popcorn would be burnt, or only a small portion of the bag would be popped.  Sometimes there would only be a few peices of popcorn that popped and they would be burned anyways!  Even the generic grocery store brands of popcorn pop better than this.  When I had the best luck with this product, a the unburned popcorn would fill about 1/4 of the bag.  But when i tried to eat it, since it was such a small amount of popcorn, it was soaked in grease and butter and tasted terrible.  I'm surprised that such an inferior product is located under a search for ""gourmet food"" when it doesn't even compare to the cheapest brands of popcorn on the market."
5.0,Great Product,Great product. Orange bitters were originally used in cocktails before the invention of the aromatic type we are all so familiar with today. This is impossible to find in the commonwealth of PA where I live so I was happy to find it on Amazon.  I recommend it.
5.0,Crunchy and Sweet,"This flake cereal is crunchy and sweet and a nice, wheat-free/corn-free/GF breakfast or snack food.  Reasonably priced, too."
1.0,Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product,"I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn""t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!"
5.0,The taste that stole my heart,"I had never liked the taste of coffee. I thought the smell was nice, but the taste seemed far removed from that aroma. Then, I went to Italy and, being the (American) tourist that I was, I had to try every food and drink my teenaged hands could reach. In a tiny cafe in Assisi, I had my first shot of espresso. It was dark, strong, and bitter in a peculiarly pleasant way. Since then, I have been trying to recreate that taste and this is the closest I have come to it with a grad student-type budget and local equipment. Thank you!  Now please, Zicaffe', if you would, offer this in larger quantities as you do your other espresso pods, I would greatly appreciate it."
1.0,"Horrible, Anything but Mild, Gritty, Awful Taste, Awful appearance","This is the absolute worst food product I have ever bought.  It looks awful, tastes awful and is anything but mild.  After tasting it, I threw 5 unopened boxes in the trash.  Don't even think of trying this slop.  Yuck!"
1.0,What Nobody Tells You About RAW Maca...,"I have never written a review before but I always consult Amazon.com reviews before buying a product so thought I would give back at least once. I bought this product BEFORE I thoroughly researched it due to lifelong problems related to a hormonal imbalance and was soooo excited I just bought what I thought would be good; raw and organic. I took this product for 3 days until I broke out in hives. I only took 1/2 tsp day one and 1/4 tsp days 2 and 3. I got the hives day 2 but was hoping they were not related to the Maca (they were). So.... I researched more and there is one very informative forum I found on google (hard to find and not sure if I'm allowed to refer it or not but here it is but FINISH reading to the bottom or you will not try this product ever): [...]. There are a bunch of websites and some scientific reviews, but long story short, it appears that Maca MUST be eaten pre-cooked (gelatinized) to obtain therapeutic benefits and to alleviate potential problems related to digestion (when eaten raw) and possible toxicity (raw) the way the native Puruvians have done for thousands of years to the present (cooked). There are studies that show ingesting raw Maca is worse than not adding it to the diet at all. Based on what I've read you need to start SLOWLY with the dosage and adjust it according to your body's needs, then take a break from it occasionally or it appears to lose potency. If improper dosages are taken it exacerbates the imbalance/symptoms. There are (reportedly) many benefits of Maca on the entire Endocrine system and I still have high hopes so ordered from another company who doesn't sell raw Maca due to the reasons above. I believe Navitas also has a gelatinized version of the Maca but I bought one with DIM to prevent the overproduction of bad estrogen which can cause cancer in people with a family history. Hope this helps!"
1.0,Bad.,"I got a box of these yesterday, and at first I thought they were actually spoiled.  After I re-read the reviews, I realized that they are just that bad.  I usually try to throw in a positive, but I just cannot think of one.  If they tasted good and the carbs were not nearly as high (24g per bar) I would be happy to pay the money, but for how bad they taste and how they really aren't very low-carb diet friendly, 1 star.  Really, though, I wish they would have stated the carb count on the ad."
1.0,Artificial colors and flavors,"My tongue hurts.  Just ate my first Haribo gummy bears and now my tongue hurts and has several raised sores on the end of it.  Shocked, I read the packaging and noticed that they have artificial flavors and colors.  Yuck.  If I'd known that, I would not have purchased them.  I see now that this information is on the Amazon website, but I guess I was swept away by all the good reviews and didn't read it carefully enough. Ouch."
5.0,Great Halloumi!,Cheese is cheese but for the price and delivery time this Halloumi is great.  Just like we used to get in Europe.  Great flavor and grills easily.
5.0,Yum!,"This is the best hot sauce I've ever found in a grocery store!  If you can find it, get it!"
1.0,"Rancid, stale, weak",I believe the title says it all.  While this might be the 'batch' I received.  wow.  too bad 0-stars is not an option.
5.0,Delicious,"Generally I do not like tea, but I ordered this because I heard about its health benefits.  I was surprised that I really love it.  The taste is so smooth and delicious.  I will be ordering more."
1.0,Overpriced!`,I buy my lemonade koolaid for 10 cents a package locally.  72 of them is $7.20. Can you bring us a better price on this?
5.0,Price,"A great product. You can't tell it's a sugar free product.  HOWEVER...... the price here is atrocious. Amazon supplier is asking $6.33 a 16 oz. box.  At Walmart it's 1.78,  at Ingles it's 2.38 and Harris Teeter it's 2.58."
5.0,Love the soft laces!!  The Best Ever!!,This licorice reminds me of the Amish laces I used to buy in little small bags on the road in Lancaster Pa. I looked all over to find find laces like that again. I am not a fan of hard licorice.  This however is the best I have ever had. Best Ever!!  I Love it!!
5.0,Love it,"There are a lot of mixed reviews for this soup, but I'm pretty much in love with it. The flavor is unlike any other miso soup I have had and the noodles are perfect. I like to eat this slowly and savor every bite and sip of the broth. Much less salt and fat than traditional ""cup-o-noodle""-type products, but with much more flavor. Some people like it, some don't, but considering how much I love it I think it's worth the $2 to try for yourself.  edit: Cook it in a nonstick pan with a bag of frozen vegetables until the water steams out for a creamy noodle meal."
5.0,Best Coffee,We had not been able to find the Dark Roast Yuban in any of the stores recently. When I ordered this they gave me a date of receipt. It actually came two days earlier. My husband was so excited when he saw what I had ordered. Thanks for the quick service on a great product.
1.0,"Price increased, size decreased","I bought these bars for several years at my local co-operative grocery store, and ate them daily--they are tasty. However, the price increased nearly 100% during that time, and I noticed that, although the individual wrappers within the box remained the same size, the bar within the wrapper decreased. When I stopped buying these, the actual bar was only half the size of the wrapper. That's deceptive packaging, so I refuse to buy these any more. I suspect that other shoppers likewise complained, because last month the store where I bought these stopped carrying them."
1.0,NOT GLUTEN FREE,The ingredients listed for this product prominently include wheat flour.  Foods that contain wheat flour are never gluten free.  People with celiac disease will definitely get the owie tummy if they eat this.  CONTAINS WHEAT. NOT GLUTEN FREE!
5.0,Heritage Cereal," Nature's Path Organic Heritage Flakes Cereal, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) I have this cereal for breakfast 5 days a week.  Like the low sugar content and 'ancient' grains. Eat it with lots of fruit on top."
1.0,Terrible aftertaste,"After finding some user reviews on other sites, I was hopeful that this would be a decent dessert.  Unfortunately the sucralose taste is way too strong for me.  I had the aftertaste in mouth for a full day.  After trying a pack, the rest of the box went in the trash."
1.0,Ashtray comes to mind,"If you are a smoker, this coffee is for you.  It tastes EXACTLY like an ashtray smells.  I love strong coffee though, but no ashtray taste.  My favorite is Starbucks Espresso Roast or Verona, I have found the Newman's Own Extra Bold to be the best replacement for that available in the k cups."
5.0,"great, classic product","a classic- the king of ketchups, period. love the new caps, easy to dispense and keep tip clean after using, and easy to store upside-down."
1.0,Beware: Leaking Brown Liquid over Time,"I have been using this little machine for just a few months(2-3 months).  I absolutely loved it for a few times in the beginning.  Then, it starts to leak brown liquid that looks like lubricant or oil from the center steel part.  I tried to clean the center vigorously and completely dry it before using it again.  Same leaks happened.  What a waste of $100 for very short usage.  I am calling service center but, I will not be using it again until permanent solution is found.  I am not going to feed oil/lubricant to my 8-months-old baby.  Very UPSET!!!  Going back to old pan and magic bullet method for now."
1.0,never buy plants by mail,"The bonsai came in completely dead. It arrived almost a month after I ordered it. It was very sad opening the package to find a dead, dry, and creeping looking bonsai. Certainly nothing like the one shown on the picture. I would never buy a plant through the internet ever again."
5.0,Great grilling seasoning,"Even though I suspect this is ground up beef bouillion it does not matter as it works in a superior way to season grilled steaks on a barbeque. I fully coat the meat and sear at high temps to creat a savory crust. I have never found its equal and do not enjoy most premade seasonings for grilling, however this is an exception. It is also a rare exception to my rule that any ingredient list that reads like a chemical factory was needed to make it should not be eaten. This seasoning only really works well when cooking on the broiler or barbeque, do not bother if frying in a pan, it is not the same. Buon appetito"
5.0,"Great just be aware, it is instant not fresh brewed.","I tried the French vanilla cappuccino and it tastes great, but it is a kcup filled with a powder not a ground coffe, I will definitely buy again."
5.0,Great Marinara,"I can't understand the one-star reviews. ""Runny?"" That's hyperbole. This is marinara and the consistency is one of this sauce's assets. Ragu it ain't. Speaking of, it's also not cloyingly tomatoey like a lot of bottled pasta sauces. It's not sweet, which is as it should be. I thought it needed a little salt to bring out the flavors more, but that's just my taste and it's easily fixed. It's great right out of the jar, but makes a great base for other sauces, and it's really good to dip fried calamari or cheesy garlic bread in. Great bottled option if you're not into making your own all the time."
1.0,Sad replacement of original recipe,"With the new packaging came cheap flavor. I WAS a major fan and promoter of Good Earth Tea to my family and friends, drinking it once or twice daily. But, since Good Earth changed their product ""wrapper"", I can hardly stand the stuff. It has a bland and artificial flavor now, even though the package indicates all natural ingredients. Think twice before buying this! I would go back to drinking Good Earth in a second if they would return to the previous recipe, because I loved it!"
5.0,A delectable bargain,"This is really nice cheese.  smooth in texture, rich tasting, and with just enough bite to be interesting.  It makes a wonderful sandwich in thin slices  with smoked ham. Tomorrow, I'm going to try it with Mac and Cheese...."
1.0,Made in CHINA,Beware.. there are warnings to NOT feed your dogs chicken treats made in China.  They are causing kidney failure and DEATH.  I use to give my pets these and they loved them.. but I'm not going to risk my babies health with a product made in China. [...]
1.0,not as discribes.,"placed 2 orders, came in with 2 seperated brown paper bags, I Purchased coffee, but mixed with tea cups, one of the bad has only 33 k-cups in it. missing 2.. I will never purchase from this seller again.."
1.0,Not Monkey King which the 'directions' and some 'reviews' indicate,"I thought I was getting the Jasmine Monkey King green tea, because both the 'directions' and some of the 'reviews' mentioned it.  But, when I used the first pack, it didn't taste like Jasmine Monkey King green tea I've had before, and the box did not mention it being 'Monkey King' tea.  It smells great before it is steeped, but after steeping, the scent is gone, and the taste is just ok. I am disappointed, and I am stuck with 3 boxes of it, as it is not returnable.  I wonder if Amazon posted REVIEWS of another Numi tea here by MISTAKE, because the box I received did not mention Monkey King.  Not happy."
1.0,Red Barn - Chew-A-Bulls,"I purchased these at a big-box petstore locally and I was rather miffed to discover that these are not what they appear. I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the ""Red Barn"" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle. Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these. I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others."
1.0,Too confusing for my dog,"I decided to try this ""treat"" with my new dog. I am trying to teach her different responses and thought that a treat that did not add calories to her diet would be a good idea.  I introduced the treat to her and she ignored it at the beginning. The shape of the container is of one of the old fashioned roll-on deodorants. I moved the ball around to get some of the liquid on it and re-introduced it to my dog. She liked the flavor but was frustrated with it as the ball gets stuck. She tried a few times and ended up yanking the container from my hand and running away with it.  She is a very fast dog and when I caught up with her she had managed to rip the ball of the container. Lucky for me she did not swallow the ball as I think it could have killed her. I picked up the ball and threw it away. I could not get container from her as she was busy using it as a chew toy.  I will not be buying this product for her as it is hard to use and I do not think that she should be chewing on plastic. The contents were delicious to her as they were a chicken based.  I do not recommend this product."
5.0,Lovely,"I'm a big fan of this sipping chocolate. It doesn't have chemical-type ingredients or nasty oils, so that's a big plus. I was looking for something to replace my Trader Joe's sipping chocolate indulgence and this fits the bill. TJ's only carries theirs seasonally. The ingredients and taste are almost identical."
1.0,Glucomannan  (tree fiber)  is NOT good for you,"0 stars and even that is too many. If you are bound and determined to eat these things (any flavor) then please take the time to read and study  Glucomannan, where it comes from and the possible side effects of consuming it. Frankly, I cannot believe that it is being sold as a food product to be consumed in a fairly large quantity.  Should you eat these noodles do plan on staying close to home as you may find that the  Glucomannan has quite an effect on your digestive system.  Personally, I'd rather eat a tree.  Plus they smell just awful - when you open the package you get a waft of dead fish."
1.0,Listing is misleading - No cocoa butter to be found,"For some reason I thought these were white chocolate - you know, the kind with cocoa butter.  Silly me for assuming that Ghiradelli would sell chocolate (or at the very least products containing ingredients from the cacao plant).  The only thing these have in common with the cacao plant is that they are produced by a company with chocolate in their name.  Disappointing flavor and funny texture.  Not at all what I thought I was buying."
1.0,Smint candy,I dont get it. This candy tastes like altoids with a  little sugar.  I was looking for a good mint candy. This isnt it.
1.0,disappointed,"I am a fan of big bowl noodles, however, this time, I received a package with some problematic packaging. one of the products was already open inside of the box. As a result, I had to throw it out"
5.0,Jerk Chicken perfection.,"I used to buy Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning at Bev Mo, but they stopped carrying it. In fact I can't find it in any grocery store in San Francisco any longer. Why is this? This jerk seasoning is FANTASTIC!!!  It's got good heat and does not need anything added. I put rub 2 or 3 tablespoons of it all over a whole chicken and then roast it in my Showtime rotisserie and it is excellent. The chicken skin even gets somewhat crispy despite the wetness of the seasoning. This stuff is outstanding."
5.0,Olive lover,These are the best olives ever - buttery and sweet but not too salty.  They arrived in quickly and in perfect condition.  Fabulous and delicious.
1.0,Really don't get the rave reviews. Tastes like stale butterscotches.,"I made the mistake of buying a 50 pack of these k cups when they were on sale. The first few were decent, but the more I drank them, the more I started to dislike the flavor. At this point, I'm pretty much forcing myself to get through them since I don't want to waste them. The best way I can describe the flavor is a mixture of watered down coffee and old, stale butterscotch candy. Ugh."
1.0,No. Just no.,"This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite ""deal"" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.  First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. SSeriously, Google ""Doctor Cyberman innards"" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.  You can't even call them noodles.  I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are."
5.0,This is the stuff!,"Thank goodness for MexGrocer. We love this Pico Pica sauce. I cannot find this product in local grocery stores anymore.  Internet shopping makes living in a podunk town bearable. No more long lists saved for the occasional trip to the ""big city"". I am on a first name basis with the UPS and FedEx drivers. USPS shipments are hit and miss, if they fit in the mailbox, great, if not, then it's saddle up and head to town. Pico Pica is our favorite product, it is so good!  Love it!"
5.0,Stephens Gourmet Hot Chocolate,This is the best hot chocolate!  I love it!  I can't find it near where I live but when I saw it was available on Amazon I was soooo happy!  I ordered two and put one in the freezer for this winter!
1.0,Waste Of Money,you can get the apple chips any where for like two dollars a bag 64 dollars for 12 thats a little much man I sure love apple chips but it's so not worth it !
5.0,Millstone Hazelnut Cream-What a great coffee to wake up to!,This coffee is the best coffee ever. It is not too strong and does not have the bitter taste that the other Hazelnut coffees have. I only wish that it was easier to buy locally and on Amazon and not as expensive as it is. I will continue to search for it wherever I go and watch for it to become available on Amazon.
5.0,perfect pizza!,"Two of my (four) boys is gluten-free. Pizza is a favorite in our house, and I have been trying to find the perfect GF pizza crust for them. I decided to make this for all of us (my boys and myself) for pizza movie night tonight. My non-GF son and I could not tell the difference in taste from a regular pizza! This has me completely sold. Before we were using Bob's (red mill) pizza crust, but I couldn't eat it myself, so I kept searching. One thing I did differently, that may help someone: I did not have any apple cider vinegar, so I used 1/2 tsp of apple juice and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. I don't know what it should have tasted like, but it tasted fine to me! I also dusted my hands in GF flour before forming the dough in the pan and it made it much easier to handle (too sticky otherwise). And I also did as the above poster and par-baked the crust before adding the toppings."
1.0,It's Not Coffee or even Coffee Like!,"Well for reasons I will not go into here I needed to give up my morning caffeine habit.  This was a major problem for me since I am a coffee lover!  I don't just drink coffee for the kick, I also drink it for the flavor which I adore.  When I say adore, let me explain that further by saying I have worked in the coffee industry and tasted some of the best coffees on the planet! My favorite of all time being sun dried, Tanzanian Peaberry! So, suffice it to say, I'm a bit of a coffee nut. I mean, I'm the black no sugar coffee guy, and I've been drinking coffee since High School. So, having to give it up coffee completely was a horrifying thought!   After my thoughts of suicide subsided I decided to look into some of the coffee alternatives just to see what's available.  I thought, ""If I can't have coffee, maybe I can have something that tastes like coffee?"" Right?  WRONG!!!  I reviewed several products, and coffee substitutes paying close attention to the reviewers comments regarding product flavor.  I realized that these products would not taste exactly like coffee, but I was looking for the product that was ""Most Coffee Like"", and Teeccino was rated highest in these categories.  I believed that I was onto something grand!  A coffee substitute that actually tastes ""like"" coffee.  I mean what is the point of a ""Coffee Substitute"" if it doesn't actually taste like coffee? Boy was I in for a let down!   Upon receiving the product I immediately read the instructions on how to ""Brew"" my Teeccino.  I put on some water to boil and waited with great anticipation, almost like a kid on Christmas morning.  In the past I have used a French Press for coffee, but for this application I thought manual drip would be a better fit. When I began to pour the water over this concoction, I began to smell something tangy, almost sour.  It did not smell anything like coffee.  Once my cup was brewed, I brought it to my nose, and the Teeccino smelled burnt, liked burned sugar and raisins.  The taste? Well, Teeccino has all of the negative qualities of bad coffee, but without actual coffee flavor. It is very acidic and bitter with an after taste that can only be described as tasting like bug spray smells.  Honestly!  The lingering flavor in my mouth really reminded me of the smell of bug spray!  It was so foul that it gave me a sour stomach and made me nauseous for about an hour after trying it. If I could give this product a rating of zero stars I would.  Take it from me, do not believe what other reviewers have written, Teeccino tastes and smells nothing like coffee!  This has got to be the worst hot beverage that I have ever tasted!  I didn't even bother to return the Teeccino, I was so disgusted that I threw it out in order to prevent further damage to any of Amazon's other customers!"
5.0,Nice,"I live in Brazil and I could not find the movie ara sell here, I contacted all distributors and could not find the movie on DVD. I decided to look into the amazon and found on Blu-Ray. I was very happy with the purchase and now I can only enjoy."
1.0,Incredibly misleading,"This cereal is very misleading: the box claims to have blueberry clusters (photo shows abundant clusters) but contains at most two or three clusters PER BOWL, maybe 15 clusters PER BOX. As someone who rarely reviews anything, the extreme lack of blueberries and apparent false advertising was so laughable that I felt the need to find reviews on the Internet to see how others received it. I find it very surprising that there are so many positive reviews... Is the lack of blueberries a new thing? Perhaps the economic meltdown has led to Kashi grossly cutting back on including dried fruit in their products? I think the answer is yes. That, or maybe we should just all stop making the silly assumption that a cereal that claims to have ""oat flakes & blueberry clusters"" actually has blueberry clusters."
1.0,Not for a chewer!,"While my English Setter likes the busy buddy tug-a-jug, it didn't last a day. He chewed the rope off and emptied the treats quite swiftly. I think it would be great for a dog that doesn't chew thru things."
1.0,Nutritional calculations questionable,"Multiple discrepancies between the product package and the company website make it impossible for me to know what the correct crude protein level and sodium content of this product are. Customer service was less than willing and able to  help. I made all my attempts to find this info before offering it to my cat, who is supremely uninterested in this stuff. See my comment to Jim's review for details of my poor cust svc experience."
1.0,Double Salt and DOUBLE AMMONIA!,"The fourth ingredient in this candy is ammonium chloride. Too bad I didn't read the label before ingesting this product.  It has been several hours since I ate my first and LAST two pieces of this candy and I still have the sensation and smell of ammonia in my nose.  A spicy dinner and a Neti Pot nasal wash did not remove it.  This is one of the worst things I have ever had in my mouth (or up my nose...) and I am heartily glad I bought a single carton at a local store before buying a CRATE at amazon.com.  I'm a salty licorice lover.  This licorice is very salty, hardly sweet (that's what I expected) but packs an unpleasant and lasting ammonia wallop that I found intolerable."
1.0,dead plants,"Bought 2 plants and both died within the first 2 weeks of receiving them. Plants looked ok when arrived, but when I potted them, they died. Had bought another at IKEA and it's doing great. Don't waste your money."
1.0,BAD,The service is really bad! its about a week and my order hasn't been shipped yet! About the product itself I cant tell you yet because I still have to wait 2 weeks to receive it.
1.0,moo tubes,"moo tubes arrived and are very different in size and much smaller than i assumed.  the ones at my local pet store are more than double the size for not much more money, so i assumed these were the size of the ones at my expensive local pet store.  i was disappointed at their small size and, very unhappy with their varied sizes.  some were half the diameter of the one in the picture and with two dogs, if you dont give them equal sized products, one finishes first and then fights with the other for theirs.  Consistent size does matter with doggies.  these are about three bucks each.  Petsmart has ones that are more than double the size right now for 2.50 each on sale and they are only 3.50 each regular price.  i wont be buying these again."
5.0,Munchy Chicken Sticks,Great for your dogs teeth! I an a huge fan of this kind of rawhide as it is very chewable and crunchy and digests well in your dogs tummy! He is a huge fan of them also. LOVES them! Excellent value as always thru Amazon.
1.0,Old crackers taste old,Ordered my favorite crackers that my grocery store does not stock.  Received from this seller and all six boxes Stoned Wheat Thins 10.6 Oz - 6 Unit Pack  are about to expire.  Taste terrible.  Guess I will have to go back to Ritz crackers!
1.0,Kraft Catalina What Happened?,"The new formulation of a this standby product is terrible. The taste  and smell have lost their zing and freshness. I can no longer use the is product. The only reason for the  ""new coke"" Catalina, must be it is cheaper to make."
5.0,Delicious!,I am an advid tea drinker therefore I have drank many teas and this one is wonderful especially with a drop of milk and stevia - what a comforting warm drink to relax with in the morning! I even gave some to my Brother and he loved it as well! No complaints here what so ever! If you're debating about it - go ahead and buy some!
1.0,yuk,"i guess that i was expecting something ""chunkier"" it tastes like salty mush to me - i started adding it to big pots of chili to try to use it up"
5.0,Great taste!!!,I did not purchase this here. (Cheaper at the nationwide chain WM) But this does blow McCormick out of the water. This taste so much better and no need to add stuff like I usually do with other gravy packets. This make s about 2 cups instead of 1 from other packets. This taste better than the jar or canned gravy too!
5.0,My kids love these in their oatmeal,"I love Mott's Healthy Harvest applesauce cups. It is only fruit-no added sugar. These are blueberry, but in stores you can also get country berry, strawberry, peach, and granny smith apple. Most days, my kids have oatmeal. Instead of brown sugar, I stir in one of these cups which sweetens the oatmeal naturally as well as adds color in most cases."
5.0,Only formula daughter can take,"My daughter struggled with the newborn formula.  Constant crying and vomiting.  Since we changed to this formula, no more gas.  No more crying.  No more vomiting.  She is gaining weight well and thriving on this formula!"
1.0,Way to salty for snacking.....,"I would not buy these again.  They are so salty and leave a briney aftertaste.  Can be used as croutons for soup or salad, but not just eaten plain. It makes for very expensive coutons.  Great concept, but poor execution."
1.0,Explodes every time,"I've been trying a few Kombuchas and get this one when I'm in whole foods because they only have a few brands and this is the cheapest. None of the others spill all over the place like this one. I thought that it was because i was shaking it by accident but now I realize that it's not that. And, honestly, it doesn't really taste as good as some of the others. Sorry."
1.0,My dogs love 'em: update re dog sickness /made in China. Amazon should stop selling.,Updating my prior review from  2009 as my dog was very sick with a mystery illness last year with enlarged liver and kidney issues.  I was heartsick as he was so ill.  I spent several thousand dollars on vet care and testing.  It never dawned on me it could have been these chews -- I just realized that they were made in China and the brand is listed as one of those implicated according to this month's Whole Dog Journal.  Amazon should stop selling These until the manufacturer stops using their China plant.
5.0,Chicken Pill Pockets,"These are great!  I first used them when my Japanese Chin needed meds as a puppy.  Now I give them to her everyday at dinner time, picking off little pieces and rolling them into balls.  She thinks she's eating the same thing I am!  She is super fussy where treats are concerned and I have spent waaaay to much money to find snacks she will eat.  But, she loves the pocket pills for ""dinner"".  No, they're not really her dinner as she always has her food in her bowl.  I never give them to her just for a treat.  I'm so glad she loves them!!"
1.0,false advertising," Seasons, Sardine Brslng Qurtr O Oil, 3.75 OZ (Pack of 12)   Okay, the product was not bad; fairly good, even.  BUT the Amazon description says 'Norway', yet the packaging says 'Scotland'; the Amazon description says 'Extra Virgin' Olive Oil, but the packaging says 'Pure' Olive Oil.  Yes, there was a 'legal disclaimer' that sort of alerted you to their intent of false advertising, but selling products based on a blatant falsehood should be considered unacceptable and even intolerable by all, vendors and consumers alike.  Corporate dishonesty seems to be the accepted norm nowadays."
1.0,Disappointed,"I love sourdough bread, but this is not close to that.  The bread has a sour, unpleasant taste, a gummy texture, and a horrible aroma.  I will never buy this again."
5.0,The 13 Healthiest Snack Foods By Details Magazine,"I came across a review by Details Magazine last night: "" Pumpkin Chips Pumpkins are higher in beta- and alpha- carotene than almost any other food, and recent studies have found that those who eat the most orange foods live longer. These thick-cut pumpkin slices are the perfect longevity snack.""  wow......Aside from the heath benefits; the pumpkin chips taste great as snacks.  Sometime I sprinkle them on salad for extra crunch."
5.0,Awesome product!,Received this a couple of days ago- it has a wonderful light flavor and I highly recommend it to everyone!
1.0,It doesn't taste very good.,"SweetLeaf SteviaClear liquid does not taste good at all.  I purchased this to make cookies for my brother's girlfriend Mary who has a medical condition that doesn't allow for her to consume sugar or carbohydrates.  She uses a lot of Splenda, but Splenda can cause an array of problems (formaldehyde on the brain for example).  I thought Stevia would be a good alternative to try.  I wasn't expecting to like it myself because I don't like sugar substitutes such as Splenda or aspartame, but I thought at least Mary would like it.  I thought wrong.  This product has a nasty bitter aftertaste that tastes very similar to fingernail polish remover.  It's horrible.  Mary did not like it nor did anyone in my family.  I tried the Stevia in cookies, tea, and coffee, but nothing was able to mask the nasty aftertaste.  I would recommend steering away from this product and so would Mary."
1.0,Pure Premium? I think NOT.,I ordered a pack of 12 last week and after reading the ingredients on the label I discovered that this is NOT PURE.  There are added ingredients that are unnecessary and I prefer Vita Coco over Zico any day.
1.0,yucccky crackers,I had tried this craxker in a snack pack at Starbucks...well they must have a special cracker mad just for them..cuz these were yuccky..yes i own a huge box of nasty crackers..even took them to work where people will eat anything..cant give them away..oops
1.0,Extremely weak coffee,"The vanilla flavor is good, but you can't taste the coffee at all.  It is so watery that I was unable to drink it even when I set the coffee maker to the smallest cup size (4oz.)"
5.0,Long-lasting flavor in a xylitol gum,"I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth.  I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems."
5.0,"Eden All Mixed Up Too, Nuts Seeds and Dried Fruit is wonderful!"," Eden All Mixed Up Too, Nuts Seeds & Dried Fruit, 4-Ounce Pouch (Pack of 5)   Eden All Mixed Up Too, Nuts Seeds and Dried Fruit is everything the company claims. It is a delicious blend of seeds and nuts and dried fruit that is so pure and easy to eat! There were no husks or stems! It truly is a great product I am eager to buy more! I would recommend this product to anyone who loves wholesome nutrition."
1.0,Need ingredient listing,Had I known there was aspartame in this I would never had ordered.  Amazon need to make ingredients readily available.
5.0,Really Raw,"Have been using this product for quite some time and haven't found anything to beat it.  Amazingly, my glucose numbers have been fine when using it and it is just sweet enough to satisfy my taste.  The product arrived on time and was packed so as to ensure no damage to the bottle.  I highly recommend the shipper."
1.0,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews, this sounded like a cool idea!  Sounded like, doesn't make it so.  They were sloppy and water/coffee dribbled out all over.  At first it was really bad, then after experimenting, I found it was only limitedly messy.  At least the removable cup stand caught all the excess rather than like at first where it spilled all over the counter.  I tried filling the k-cup full with coffee; filling it full and tamping it down; filling it partially - no way worked without a dribbly mess.  It was a lot of extra work, too, rinsing the cups out, letting them dry, filling them, etc.  Hassle!  I liked the idea of using my own coffee cuz we like Starbucks and their k-cups are really expensive.  Now we just buy our k-cups at Sam's Club.  Best price, even beats Costco.  They have several brands and I don't feel guilty throwing away the used cups.  Will save our Starbucks for our ""regular"" coffee maker when we want a treat.  Maybe someone else had better luck with these caps, but I sure didn't."
5.0,Great for macarons!,"This is really nice almond flour, very fine like it says and doesn't have those dark pieces from the skins like some flours do. I use it to bake macarons and this was great for it both in texture and color. Its a two pack, but I'm sure I'll be buying some more of it soon."
5.0,Once you pop - you can't stop!,"These are wonderful.  Very satisfying, great flavor - I highly recommend to anyone that enjoys chips and doesn't want the fat and calories in typical chips.  These are unique and have a great ""crunch""."
1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!!  A complete waste of money,"I purchase a lot of products from Amazon. This is the first time I wanted to return an item and these are not returnable. The product is not sampling of the flavors but appears to be a box of all the flavors they couldn't sell individually. There are so many multiples of flavors I would never use (ie: 4 cinnamon, 3 peppermint, 2 watermelon), this is a complete waste of money. And, it didn't contain any of the flavors I most wanted to try."
5.0,Why didn't they think of this sooner?,"There's not much reason to review the actual graham crackers here. If you like graham crackers, then there's absolutely nothing to dislike here. This is the same classic, sweet, wholesome snack you've been enjoying from Honey Maid for years, just packaged in a way that's better for you (and the crackers). Every time that I've ever bought graham crackers in the past, the larger packs will end up being halfway eaten while the remaining crackers always (and I mean ALWAYS) end up stale. By changing the packaging and giving you six bundles instead of two, your crackers will stay fresh, crisp and tasty until you're ready for them. Throw in the added convenience of the smaller packs (much easier to throw in a bag, purse or lunch box) and this is truly one of those ideas that leaves you wondering why it hadn't been done years before. Honey Maid Fresh Stacks are now the only way to buy graham crackers."
5.0,healthy and delicious,"These chips are great!  They look almost like a flattened rice cake, but taste so much better, more like a potato chip. The bbq flavor is delicious. They are very low in fat and full of flavor. It is easy to eat an entire bag of these!"
1.0,No directions. Called customer service. Ended up with a real mess on my head anyhow.,"The only directions for use that came with this product, if they can be called that (which I submit they cannot), read as follows: ""1. Cleanse 2. Smooth 3. Soothe 4. Seal.""  Huh?  I was clueless, so I called the 800 number at the bottom of the ingredients list, got connected to Customer Service and asked how I was supposed to go about using their product. The rep told me to massage the product into my scalp right AFTER shampooing, while my hair was still wet, then to ""pull it through"" my hair with my fingers and the result would be not only a healthier scalp, but also shinier hair. What I got was a head of hair that could have easily won auditions for revivals of ""Grease,""  ""Jersey Boys"" and maybe even ""West Side Story."" Good thing I tried this on a day when I didn't have to be seen in public, as it took four very thorough shampooings  before there was any way I was going to be able to take my head out of the house that day. Anybody here have Travolta's number? 'Cause I've gotta nice big fat jar of stuff with only about a teaspoon's worth gone missing and it's looking for a good home."
5.0,Best gummies ever!,"These truly are the absolute best gummi bears I have ever had!  The flavors are wonderfully intense.  They are not waxy or hard, just perfectly soft and chewy.  It turns out 10 pounds of gummi bears is even more than I thought it would be.  They will definitely last you a good long while!  Enough for a whole party of people.  Everyone was asking me, ""aren't all gummi bears pretty much the same?"" but once they started eating them, they couldn't stop either!"
1.0,"Had such great hopes, but......","We have three cats - two wanted nothing to do with it no matter how many times we tried.  Ended up pooping on the carpet, something they have never done before.  The other cat, who uses this litterbox, gets diahrea on a regular basis.  The box is not designed for that type of mess!  We ended up scooping most of the granules out.  So if your cat has these type of issues, do not use!"
1.0,This coffee is just bad,"First, the beans smelled bad.  So I put them in the grinder.  Then, the grounds smelled bad.  So I brewed some coffee with them.  Next, the coffee smelled bad.  So I tasted it.  And dumped it out.  Do not drink this. It is just bad."
1.0,The salt water taffy was stale and hard as a rock!,"The taffy arrived in a box and not in a sealed plastic bag as one would expect.  The taffy is stale and hard as a rock.  This is the worst salt water taffy I have ever attempted to eat.  Do NOT buy this item, as you will be forced to send it back as soon as you get it, wasting time and money."
5.0,"love the soda, not the price","Diet Dr. Pepper is the best tasting diet soda around.  However, never at a price like this.  Locally it can be bought for 1.49 each for two liters, on sale, its $1.00 each for two liters.  Why would anyone pay this price at over $3.00 for a 2 liter bottle of soda, let alone the $36 plus for delivery??  Seriously?  Not a good deal at all!!"
1.0,The title says Hot but it's not!  This wasn't at all what I wanted,"Lenny's Sub Shop was out of their sale jars of their Hot Pepper Relish (That says Hot it means HOT, that stuff will burn your tongue off) and I wanted some to put on my sandwich at home. This stuff is not any spicier than pickle relish and just as sweet."
5.0,Love this coffee!,"I am a big fan of this product, its very good coffee.  this is what I drink at work - its a smaller serving that standard American, but bigger than a Euro-shot. For me that is the perfect size, as its not so big that its get cold by the time I drink half of it.  Its a very smooth, medium balanced coffee. Not too strong and not weak either. Perfect!  Tassimo is the best coffee machine I have ever had, it is truly worth the purchase."
1.0,Another great product ruined,"Companies don't change things to make them better, they change them to try and increase their profitability.  Kraft has taken what was a great product and turned it into pure crap.  I'm sure some bean counter somewhere got a big raise for coming up with the ""new"" version of these bars and saving the company one penny per bar.  I'm sad to say that the great peanut butter bars I enjoyed are now gone.  Thanks Kraft."
5.0,my cats love this!!!,feed my cats canned food in the morning and dry food the rest of the day.  they look forward to the morning treat of canned food---i rotate the flavor so they don't loose interest.  they love it!!
1.0,GROSS!!,"I knew the moment I took my first bite...YUCK! I could taste the nasty fake sugar flavor and knew. Then I picked up the package and saw it said No Added Sugar. Let's face it, a little honey or agave nectar mixed with plain oatmeal would be 100 times better. They need to rethink their sweetener! I'm not sure what it is but I don't think it's Stevia and it needs improvement."
1.0,Like the taste of cough syrup?,This tastes very much like cherry flavored cough syrup.  A few drips of vanilla extract (maybe 1/2 tsp per bottle) completes the illusion.
5.0,a chocoholic dieter's staple,"I love chocolate, and it was really difficult for me to give up my usual brownies, chocolate chip cookies, etc. when I started eating healthier about a year ago. Thankfully, I discovered No Pudge brownies, which satisfy the chocolate cravings and sweet tooth. I always have a pan of these brownies in my fridge, and I've still lost almost 100 pounds.  Though No Pudge makes different flavors of brownies, I always get the original flavor and use different flavors of yogurt to get differently flavored brownies. I like to use black cherry or strawberry yogurt. Top one of those brownies off with a small scoop of frozen yogurt and you have an amazing dessert for only a couple hundred calories. You can also add dried fruits (I like dried cherries) to the mix before baking, and they turn out great. This mix is really versatile, and it always bakes up absolutely perfectly."
5.0,Cookie Tosser,"A friend of mine brought this to work and we decided to try it.  She tried mixing it with water, but the powder didn't seem to mix properly and it turned into this thick green muddy consistency.  She tried a sip and nearly tossed her cookies.  I thought, ""How bad could it be?""  So I mixed it up with milk and only used half a scoop.  The flavor was odd, and it left a grainy texture in my mouth which I didn't like.  I looked for ways to make it somewhat enjoyable to eat, so I dumped a packet of hot chocolate mix into it and stirred it up.  Now it tastes amazing!  Thanks Amazing Meal!  UPDATE:  I feel really sick now"
1.0,"Great candy, poor delivery","I ordered this candy from this company twice.  The first time, the six boxes arrived crammed together so tightly that the product was spilling out of the boxes and the boxes were damaged.  They were meant to be gifts for Christmas, but were hardly in gift condition.  The second time I ordered them, I got a reply back saying that they were sold out and a refund would be issued. Both they and Amazon later insisted the refund was issued, but I ended up letting my bank go after it.  Not a good experience and I won't order from this distributor again."
5.0,I am 100% disabled....,"So, I no longer have to ask anyone to go through the hassle of having them go to the ""Quicky Mart"" to procure my coffee! If you don't want to do the ""Quicky Mart"" route just do what I am doing and buy from this vendor! Why not?"
5.0,They are apple jacks...,Apple jacks are apple jacks whether you buy them in the store or from amazon.  How can you not like apple jacks. :)  I bought this cereal from amazon due to the sale price.
5.0,One of the best hot sauces I've tried,"As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of hot sauces, I would have to say that Melinda's Naga Jolokia is my absolute favorite.  While not as hot as some of the other sauces made form the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), it definitely has the best flavor of the ones I've tried.  That said, it is still very hot and there have been times my digestive system has hated me for using too much.  As far as Melinda's sauces go, I would consider this one of the best ones, and as a fan of Melinda's, that's pretty good.  As for heat, I would consider Dave's Jolokia sauce a little hotter, but I'd choose this everytime, just because the flavor is better.  But then again, that's just my opinion. Get both and try for yourself...and get that whole milk ready."
5.0,Excellent for Some Allergy Dogs,"I have been feeding this food for several months to my 9-year old ""allergy"" Lab.  He is doing wonderfully on it.  Shiny coat, good muscle... and best of all... no more ear infections!  He seems to love the taste.  I would highly recommend this food to people whose dogs have allergies to grains, peas, chicken, beef, ...etc.  Actually, I think it's a great food for dogs without allergies, too.  My non-allergic bullmastiff is doing very well on it."
1.0,tastes like nutrasweet,or aspartame. its really gross--very strange bitter sweet taste that make me really wonder what is used to preserve them... formaldehyde? yuck! plus they have 130 calories for 1/3 of a cup--too much added sugar!!! blueberries are supposed to be mildly sweet! now what am i going to do with all these nasty things?
1.0,WTF?!,Seriously?!?!? I just paid $18 for a SINGLE BOX OF POP TARTS?! I really thought that this was for a CASE of 16-count boxes. Unbelievable...........
5.0,Just started drinking coffee,"I'm an avid tea drinker found coffee to have a bitter after taste. Tried Green Mountain Wild Blueberry and got hooked. No bitter after taste, perfect hit of blueberry. Shared it with my tea drinking friends. Love it!"
5.0,Helps to organize Pods...,"Helped to oraganize all those Pods that had to be stored elsewhere. Also, easy to access since they are under coffee maker.Doesn't take up too much space on countertop. Very pleased!"
1.0,Contains MSG,These pork rinds contain MSG which is not stated on the listing.  Deceptive listing for this product.  Will not purchase again.  Shame on Amazon for wasting my money.
1.0,Description says it comes with flowers....it does not!  Not worth the price.,"I sent this as a get well gift, took 2 weeks to get there, and their were not flowers with the basket.  I wish I had just called a local florist."
1.0,Disgusting! Waste of Money!,I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive! You should take this product off of your product list. Worst product i've ever ordered
5.0,4 out of 4 dogs agree!,My dogs love this food and they are so healthy on it!  Our dogs range in size from two 10-12 lb chihuahua mixes to a 30 lb pug and a 40-ish pound pit mix.  The pug is losing weight (she needs to) and the other three are all maintaining healthy weights and shiny coats.
1.0,it's your money...,"... so if you want to buy it here it's up to you, but why would one? In any supermarket that carries them you can get them for less than $4. So even the upfront price here is somewhat excessive, but if that was not enough they got a nerve to want you to pay $10 more in ""shipping"" costs, an about 250% markup over the actual shipping cost!"
1.0,Taste nothing like a cinnamon bun!!,I don't know what kind of cinnamon buns these people eat but these tastes absolutely nothing like a cinnamon bun. I will never buy a Coffee shop item again. They Lied big time with this one....
5.0,Bet  you can't eat just one of these.,"These are awesome little dark chocolate covered chewy pomegranate candies.  Average size is about like a peanut M&M candy.  Wonderful, can't think of a bad thing to say about them except that the bag always empties too soon.  Great to have on hand (if you can keep them that long) for when company comes over. I pick them up at Costco where the price is better. What a treat!"
5.0,Cornnuts Ranch Addicting,"Addicting! this would be a one word review. I love these crunch little cornnuts, the ranch and barbeque are my favorites. If you are doing low sugar and carbs as I am these are a wonderful snack while watching tv in the evening. I will be ordering more that is for sure."
5.0,My new FAV coffee pods!,"I am a big fan of bolder coffee's and have struggled to find coffee pods that live up to the bold flavor, until now! I am such a fan of the Fog Chaser blend, that I have it on auto ship & save from Amazon!  One taste and you will see!"
5.0,Tasty and Healthy,"Many snacks labeled ""healthy"" today still have hydrogenated oils in them.  Garden of eatin' snacks do not.  The taste is wonderful.  Great with salsa and/or guacamole.  The sesame seeds add a nice flavor without being overpowering.  My favorite chip for all occasions."
5.0,"ValueBull ""bully sticks""","I purchased these bully sticks at Amazon.com. My dog just loves them. She chews for hours. Best of all, I know she is getting a high quality, safe and made in USA product. . Great quality and value for my money."
1.0,Expired???,"Cereal was 3 months expired upon arrival. I figure, I'll try it out, whats the worst that can happen. Well the good childhood memories of eating this stuff have been replaced with stale, tasteless crumbs they call Apple Jacks. And no returns? Give me a break.."
5.0,best tasting protein i had,"I tried almost all of the protein drinks, most are super sweet and taste really bad. This one taste really like chocolate milk and really love. Even my wives like and we have now always some in the fridge. Great taste and Organic on top."
5.0,Best granola EVER!,"You have to try this wonderful granola.  It is the best granola I have ever had! Trust me, we have a lot of ""granola"" to choose from in the Boulder, CO area and this one is perfect! The cinnamon is just the perfect amount and it is not too sweet. And it won't break your jaw when you chew it.  My kids loved it in yogurt and right out of the bag as a snack. We loved how  healthy it is for all of us.  We couldn't wait for more!"
1.0,Not cheesy at all,"Other reviewers compared these to goldfish or cheezits.  No way!  First, they have that sandy, powdery feel that so many gluten free baked goods have. Plus they are really lacking in cheese flavor.  I'll probably use them with chili or in crab cakes. But as something to snack on, I'd have to be really desperate."
1.0,Rip off,Having a hard time locating this product in the store we foolishly purchased from Amazon where I have always gotten great deals to pay over 3x the price which we have since found Shop Rite carries..
5.0,"Pricey, but great","I have three dogs, and they can be picky about what food and treats they like.  When offered these chews, though, there is no hesitation at all.  And the dogs always chew them up right away, they never get stashed for later."
5.0,Senseo Vienna Hazelnut Waltz Coffee Pods,The Senseo pods are easy to use and brew a strong but very pleasant cup of coffee. Hazelnut Waltz is one of my favorites.
1.0,ghost is right...because i havent seen it,I bought this novelty plant about 2 months ago and I've got to say it sucks. Don't waste your money. I've read a lot about growing these chilis and I am doing everything perfectly including keeping the seeds/soil warm. I live in Arizona so warm temperatures aren't a problem. After a month of trying to grow the plant I contacted the magic plant company. They sent me more seeds which looked like the flakes you put on pizza minus the seeds. I planted them anyway. Another month later...and still nothing. I wouldn't waste my time with this. Go on eBay and buy the whole live plant if you want to have a ghost chili plant.
5.0,Roma,My husband and I love this make believe coffe and are so glad we found where we could buy at a reasonable price.
5.0,So addicting!,"These are the best ginger chews on the planet!  The sweetness and the flavor of the orange pairs perfectly with the spicy ginger.  These are so good to suck the orange flavor while the spice of the ginger creeps in.  It's hard not to just chew them up, though, because they are so tasty.  I, admittedly, ate 3/4 of a 5 oz bag in one sitting, which is why I purchased this 5 lb box.  I've tried the mango, peanut butter and peppermint flavors, too, and the orange blows them out of the water.  Be forewarned that these are incredibly addicting."
5.0,Yummy rice noodles,"I got these to make the Vietnamese soup Pho with.  Pros: - Yummy thin rice noodle - Takes only a few minutes to cook in boiling water - Denser than the see through rice noodle so good with stir fries or even gluten free Italian dishes  Cons: - I think all rice noodles come this way but not sure...There are 4 servings in 1 package and the noodles are so wrapped together that you have to make a mess pulling apart the portion you will use. My dog loves this as he munches up all the little noodles bit that break apart to the floor. To make this less annoying... 1)Put a large tupperware dish in your sink that will fit the remaining dry noodles and the pot you will cook them in next to your sink 2)Pull the whole clump of noodles out of the package over the sink and place in dish 3)Tear out the portion you want and place it in your pot then cook as usual  This greatly cuts down the mess of noodles all over the counter, floor, stove top. My pup isn't quite as happy with the results but I am :)"
5.0,Addicting,I discovered these chips at an up-scale grocery store and found them on Amazon. They are really addicting. I prefer the crunchy dried fruit to the moist dried fruit and these Apple Chips did not disappoint.
1.0,Worst I've ever seen,This is the first time I bought any product like this and it will be the last. I made a batch of biscuits and they didn't even raise. If I want to use this product without losing my money I will mix it with something else. I have usually been very happy with anything I bought from Amazon but this product has been a big disappointment.
5.0,"Great & Durable, but loud!","My 4 month old puppy loves this toy, and i dont think he will ever destroy it, its very durable. fair warning if you have wood floors it is very loud! It gets kinda annoying! All in all a good toy, probably be much better with carpet.  This was bought in July 2011, and now October 2012 UPDATE*********  This bone is still going strong, i have a pitt/shepard mix who is 1 1/2 years and a boston terrier the same age. Who both play with it, and it barely has any wear.  The noise is  not an issue now they are older, so 5 star!"
5.0,Recipients Were Very Pleased,"I cannot personally attest to the performance of the food maker.  I can only attest to the enthusiasm of my daughter and daughter-in-law when both received them as a gift from me.  They report big buck savings on feeding their three daughters (a twin and a single born within 5 days...yes, to different families).  They find the Beaba easy to use and most importantly, their daughters seem to be thriving on their food.  Happily, I have been left out of the prep of food, but take great pleasure in playing with and even feeding the girls."
5.0,Wonderful stuff - and gluten-free too!,"I'd had no luck finding a gluten-free brown sugar substitute until I found this on Amazon - and checked the manufacturer's website, which assured me it is gluten-free.  AND mostly xylitol - the sugar substitute I prefer anyway.  So I order one bag to try it, and quickly went back to order more.  It's great stuff - more like light brown sugar than dark brown, so I need to add a tad of molasses in some of my baking.  And of course like plain xylitol, it's much drier than sugar, but adding a little applesauce to whatever I'm baking helps with that.  But mostly I use it on my breakfast cereal - sprinkling cinnamon in the bottom of the bowl, adding  Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Whole Grain, Rolled Oats, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)  and a handful of raisins, microwaving it, and topping it with Ideal Brown no-cal sweetener.  Yum."
1.0,Highway Robbery,"This is a ridiculous price for this product.  The only reason I can think that they are charging such a high price is because the latte and cappaccino products were recalled because of a few people getting burned.  I think the sellers who have the product are making people pay these crazy prices, because right now you can't buy them anywhere.  My only solution to this is to buy the Chai Tea Latte and use that with my expresso discs.  For some reason, the Chai Tea is still available."
5.0,My cats like it and are healthy,"This is a good product.  It's more expensive than typical supermarket cat foods, but you get what you pay for.  Blue Buffalo is one of about a half-dozen upscale, healthier, more expensive cat food brands.  Though there are proponents and detractors of each brand, honestly, they seem all to be on a similar plane in terms of the quality and healthiness of the food (Blue Buffalo, Evo, Innova, Wellness, etc.).  After reading a gazillion websites, I concluded that Wellness Core is probably the healthiest dry food out there, but our three cats don't like it much - it's like feeding string beans day after day to a kid; they just won't eat it.  They *love* the taste of Blue Buffalo.  So we mix 1/2 Wellness Core with 1/2 Blue Buffalo Indoor Cat Dry to try to get the best of both worlds.  I can't overemphasize how much all three of our cats like the taste of the BB dry.  They will eat it as a meal, or mixed in with wet food, or even as their 11 pm snack-treat, when they are at their most finicky and demanding. All three of our cats like a wide variety of the Blue Buffalo flavors, but this particular product (for whatever reason) has really worked out well as the core of their diet.  There's no question that a lot of things improved with our cats, from digestion to fecal habits to coat shininess and smoothness, when we transitioned them over to Blue Buffalo.  I'm very satisfied with Blue Buffalo and with this product."
5.0,Great Pies!,We have always liked Oregon Fruit Products.  They are consistantly fresh and easy to cook with.  Imagine being able to order from Amazon---even more wonderful.  Great pies on the horizon!
1.0,decaf. vanilla nut creme tea review,"This is awful!  I love vanilla and nuts, and was so looking forward to this tea, but it tastes very artificial, and medicine-like.  The price per box was good compared to the store's price, and certain Stash flavors aren't in the stores, but it was just not worth it."
5.0,Great cookies,"I got the idea to purchase these cookies after watching the CNBC show ""How I made my millions"". I figured that anybody able to make a fortune from selling cookies out of Long Island probably makes some really good cookies. These cookies do not disappoint. My favorite are the white chocolate chip & macademia nut. Although the oatmeal raisin are a close second. The only thing I wished is for these to come individually wrapped inside each box, as opposed to the 7 unit celophane pack. When you open one pack, you have to commit to eating all 7 within a few days, since the cookies will lose their crispness after that."
1.0,No truffles - and maybe not organic either,"I benchmarked many truffle oils before ordering this one.  I ordered it because it is organic, and the only ingredients listed are Olive Oil and Black Truffles.  When my order arrived, I noted that there was no indication on the labeling that the product was organic.  Also, the ingredient was listed on the label as ""black truffle aroma"".  Black truffle aroma is a manufactured product, not natural, and is chemically induced by bubbling chemical gases in the oil.  There are no truffles used in manufacture.  I am not an expert on what is ""organic"", but bubbling chemicals into an oil to induce an artificial flavor does not seem ""organic"" to me.  Buyer beware!"
1.0,Below expectations,"This is not the best manuka honey you can buy. My jar arrived with a flimsy lid (I should have returned it right then, but I wanted to give it a try). The honey feels diluted and it doesn't have the consistency of real manuka honey. Yes, it's cheaper, but in the long run, you're better off with a more expensive, but potent product."
5.0,Excellent product.,"This is an excellent product. My 2 dogs love it. I have a poodle,bichon and terrier mix and he is  hard to please with his dry food. No problems with this brand. He loves it wet or dry."
5.0,"Yum, Yum! Delicious!","These Stroopwafels were absolutely delicious and arrived intact! My husband made an instant request to order more and  I will be doing just  that. These lovely cookies are perfect with coffee or English Tea. If your cup is the perfect size to let the Stroopwafle sit on the rim of your coffee mug or tea cup, let it sit on top of it for two minutes for each side. This allows the caramel in the middle to melt just enough to give you a delightful mouthful when you take a bite. Don't leave it on too long other wise the cookie will soften and fall in your cup. Makes a great gift for coffee and tea  lovers. Order some and enjoy!"
1.0,They sound great but...,"They smell HORRIBLE!  I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell.  I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong.  Call me crazy but ""natural"" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all.  Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list?  Doesn't sound very natural to me.  I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier."
1.0,omaha steaks,I sent the steaks to my daughter for a gift..she told me they were not good..she pan fried 1 and no flavor..she cut the rest up for stew..I wont buy again from Omaha steaks opal thompson
1.0,GARBAGE,"TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.I HAVE EATEN ANCHOVIES ALL OF MY LIFE AND THE BONES IN THESE WERE WHALE BONES.I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO BIG.ON TOP OF THAT THE JAR LOOKS FULL, BUT IT HAS THE ANCHOVIES WRAPPED AROUND IN A CIRCLE WITH A TOTAL EMPTY CENTER.DECEPTION UNLIMITED.THEY ALL WENT INTO THE GARBGE BEFORE I CHOKED TO DEATH ON A WHALE BONE."
1.0,not matcha,"Matcha is wonderful, but Pier Mall did not send matcha. Instead of .65 lb of matcha powder, I recd .5 lb of Chinese medicinal tea. The label was mostly Chinese and said 'matcha' nowhere. Prepackaged Chinese medicinal tea can be dangerous--it is completely unregulated, and people get sick all the time from bad ingrediants and unforseen reactions. I am asking for my money back and notifying Amazon."
5.0,Non-Messy Honey - Excellent,"The honey is sweet.  One stick is just the precise amount for teas, hot cererals, plain yogurt and for a snack. Great for kids. Will definitely order more once supply is finished. Honey sticks and a box or two of tea would make a nice gift. Seller and product are highly recommended."
5.0,A Visit to the Peppermint Room,"Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.  The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.  I am now addicted to  Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea .  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.  Or go a safer route; buy the tea from Amazon."
1.0,"Bad Hair for days, plus irritated scalp","This product comes wrapped in plastic wrap but no instructions. It has a pleasant scent, but it is really just oil, and if you want to revitalize your scalp, oil can irritate, especially if it has a scent or other additives.  It took a while to review, because this product comes with no directions. Do I wash my hair, add it to my scalp, and if so, how much? How many drops do I use? In absence of instructions, I washed my hair as usual (I have semi-dry color-treated hair), and after the shampoo cycle added some to my scalp. Instantly, I could feel the moist oily feel this product left on my scalp.  So, I proceeded, added conditioner and dried (I air-dry since my scalp is sensitive).  Almost immediately, I noticed a problem. My hands came away oily from my scalp, Not good, and NOT attractive.  Also, my scalp felt irritated by the oils and perfume. Not good. I went home and rinsed my hair out completely but unfortunately, the greasy oil remained, and I could feel the prickling of scalp irritation. Whatever ingredients are in this product, my scalp did not feel revitalized or moisturized and my hair looks greasy like I haven't washed it in days.  I'm disappointed. Perhaps better instructions and a product guide would be useful. I can't say however, that my scalp is anything but irritated and not attractive after using this."
1.0,Awful! No taste whatsoever,"Okay so I am on a diet and I love peanut butter and wanted to try something that was similar to peanut butter and i knew this wouldn't be too similar to peanut butter but this was completely awful...I even tried adding some sugar to try and get it down, reasoning with the idea that it may be good after all with a little added touch. No way! I could hardly get this down and was very disappointed. This had no taste and the worst subsitution for anything like peanut butter. i will say though that this product is guaranteed and Walden Farms will send you your money back if you don't like it just call them like I did.  Just proves it has to have some calories in it to taste good"
5.0,New convert,"I saw three cans of this in T.J. Maxx.  On a whim I bought two of the cans.  I haven't eaten this since I was a child under 8.  Therefore, I couldn't remember the taste.  But when I opened the can and started eating, it is heavenly. I went back to the store to get some more, but of course they had none.  Luckily I found the same brand at Amazon.com.  I don't know about other brands, but I sure can recommend this one.  It is a treat!not to be overlooked."
1.0,Had an allergic reaction to it as soon as I drank,"I'm always careful what I eat or drink, since I have food allergies.  I'm also allergic to chemicals.  I bought a bottle of this as part of my nutrition regimen.  As soon as I took the first sip, I had to stop drinking.  It left me with the metallic taste everybody's talking about.  My mouth immediately felt very dry and my lips and inside of the mouth started to swell up.  I wasted my money.  Will never buy again."
5.0,Wonderful Flavor,"I really like this tea & it is so hard to find, I'm thrilled to find it here. The flavor is wonderful, not grassy like some green teas."
5.0,Excellent,"Excellent, natural product for sweetening.  I wish it came in powder form like Splenda for inter-changing in recipes for baking.  This is a great product!"
1.0,"Not good, there are better options","Got this in a local supermarket...Was cheap but it does not taste good, tastes metallic .. Had to throw away after a sip There are far better options like Vita or Zico..."
1.0,Taste awful!,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this product, I decided to try it.  It looked delicious, nice packaging, but the taste and smell were really bad.  It had a bad tomato smell and taste, it just tasted old, not fresh as I expected.  The dates on the packaging were fine, not out of date, but the taste was a different story.  Now I am stuck with 3 more jars and afraid to eat it again. I also ordered the Bruschetta as well.  Haven't tried it yet, I'm a little hesitant to try since I don't want to be disappointed again and know that I wasted even more money.  Lesson learned, I won't buy anything from Amazon again without knowing more about the product or having tasted it before. I will stick with my favorite sauces from Patsy's (NY restaurant with same name).  They are sold in select grocery stores.  They are jarred sauce but taste amazing and fresh."
1.0,Authentic ...a real taste of India.,"Would have given this a four or five star rating if not for two problems. The first was the food is not completely cooked, quite ""al dente"". Both the rice and chick peas in sauce required additional cooking. The taste is quite good but what rates this a one star review is the ""dirt/sand"" contained in the meal. I tried both the Chana Masala and the Mutter Paneer and both had a bit of crunchy, gritty in it."
5.0,Great to snack on it's own - for Garlic & onion lovers only!,"I received this order on time, in good shape and the crackers were fresh and very delicious.  I ended up skipping my dinner because I opened up one package to try and finished the whole thing right out of the bag before I knew what happened!  But be warned, the garlic and onions are very strong - just the way we garlic & onion lovers prefer.  But you definitely do not want to eat it before you go out on a date.  And the rest of your family will be able to smell the evidence of your consumption soon enough. ;-)  There are only 5 ingredients & all are 100% Organic & Kosher: Golden Flaxseed, Tomato, Garlic, Onion, Celtic Sea Salt.  Crackers are certified vegan, Raw, Gluten Free, Soy Free, Nut Free, Dairy Free.  Like any seed, this does have natural & healthy fat grams but unlike commercial chips, it does not leave any salt or a greasy mess on your hands.  And don't forget to drink lots of fluids as it suggests on the bag.  If you're looking for a new healthy snack, look no more.  I know I just found it.  My only small gripe is that this brand ""Foods Alive"" has about 8 different flavors and most are avaiable at a discount PLUS FREE ""super saver"" shipping but only this GARLIC & ONION flavor costs more & charges for shipping."
1.0,bad quality,going about 6 months back. the taste sucked plus it was ineffective stimulant. i didn't realize something was wrong with the coffee at first. i was puzzled for a some time why the coffee wasn't working. but i soon found out that the brand was the problem when i switched to folgers and folgers was working.  but now folgers has gone downhill also after good performance for some time.  i don't know if mh has fixed their problem but i don't really have time/funds to test them now.
1.0,"Delicious chocolate, not shipped well",Someone gave me these chocolates for the holidays and they are terrifice. I thought that ordering from Amazon would be great but... It's the dead of winter here and the contents was one hard white block or ..something. The expiration date was two weeks from the date they arrived. I returned them but I think that I will have to find them in local stores.  They are..the best chocolates I've ever had when they are fresh.
5.0,Wonderful Take on Almonds,"These Cocoa Roast almonds are delicious.  They are not too sweet - they seem to be dusted with unsweetened cocoa, which I really like.  They are don't appear to be salted, either.  I've used them as a snack and also in a recipe - they were very good in both.  Great texture and taste.  The container is a generous size and easy to reseal."
1.0,An unfortunate truth about vanilla coffee...,"...is that it tastes like vanilla coffee. Any richness or flavor inherent in the coffee itself is obliterated by the chemical bite of the fake vanilla. I just don't think there's any way around it. Whether the coffee is decent Starbucks brand (and I'm a Starbucks drinker, admittedly), cheap grocery store brand or some kind of high-end bean, the result is the same: it's always going to taste like something you'd drink for free at a continental breakfast bar at a cut-rate hotel."
1.0,Not real Balsamic Vinegar,"Sorry, but Penguin Mints seem to sell a number of authentic-sounding balsamics that are just not the real thing."
5.0,My favourite K-Cup variety,"I have a pretty serious coffee habit.  I drink 3 or 4 cups in the morning and a couple more through the day.  I enjoy flavourful grinds, with nutty characteristics, but not too strong.  While I can and have drunk Italian style espresso, for my daily coffee I prefer something that doesn't have a chance of making me jumpy or give me a headache.  This Caribou Columbian is perfect."
1.0,Bitter Carob Powder,"I love carob powder and have bought it many times, both toasted and raw. It has a natural sweetness. This is the first time I've tried Bob's Red Mill carob powder.  I usually love their products, but this carob is bitter. Maybe they toasted it too long...? I like to mix carob powder with melted expeller pressed coconut oil to make homemade unsweetened carob bars. My bars are usually sweet enough without any added sweetener - but not with this stuff, unfortunately."
5.0,best treats,"My cat come running from any where, even if she ran outside. Her favorite treat and I just read it's discontinued, if anyone knows where I can get any more from I'll buy them all."
1.0,Pregnant and missing the flavor of wine,"I am 20 weeks pregnant and really miss the flavor of wine, especially with my dinner. I searched the web , read reviews and finally gave in and headed to a local liquor store in hopes of satisfying my craving.  I was VERY disappointed. The first sip was horrible... I tried it along with my dinner and it was just as bad. It's  like very flat VERY old Baby juice. It has no flavor AT ALL it is cheap but not even worth the $8.00 i paid for it.  I wish i had better news for all the expectant moms out there missing that glass of wine with dinner.... BUT this did NOTHING for me."
1.0,Nasty,"This flavor is NASTY the Acai part taste so artificial!  It's gross, don't waste you money. Purchased other brands with other flavors and much better.  Not sure if it's this brand or what but again the ACAI in this is discusting."
5.0,Two Pit Bulls and two very sensitive stomachs.,"For all the hype that pitbulls get, you'd think they could eat license plates, dead trees and babies and not flinch. The fact is that the dogs aren't nearly as tough as the media would mislead you to believe. And the reality is, most have extremely sensitive stomachs. I know what you're thinking... ""awwweee... poor pit bulls!"" and that's my sentiment too!  Especially when you live on the 16th floor and need to go up and down and up and down the elevator when they get the runs. Not fun.  These treats are perfect for training dogs, for small doges, for big dogs and for dogs who have sensitive stomachs. Like pit bulls.  :)"
1.0,Never again,"I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.  Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away."
1.0,"bought it, sipped it, right in the garbage","Bought it cause it cought my eye at the gas station. Seems like it wouold be a decent beverage, tasted it. no flavor, actually tasted like watered down gatorade mixed with chalk. Threw it right in the garbage."
5.0,Nescafe Coffee,I have been buying my Nescafe Coffee through Amazon.com for many months.  I started doing so with the Hazelnut flavor when my local grocery store stopped carrying this flavored coffee. Now I buy all my coffee through Amazon.com
1.0,Check your shipment,"Make sure to check your order upon receipt.  I ordered a tub of original bubble gum and instead received a tub of 5 fruit flavors.I guess  I can give it out a Halloween, but really needed regular bubble gum."
5.0,AMAZING SOYMILK,"When I first starting buying soymilk this was my go to brand. Once I moved out of the New York area I could not find this anywhere. On a whim I decided to check if Amazon sold it, since I buy tons of things on this website, and wouldn't you believe it they sell single servings in cappuccino, vanilla and chocolate. I bought the vanilla and cappuccino. They are amazing. Creamy, sweet but not too sweet and reasonably priced. I bough these when they were in the warehouse deals and go them super cheap. I would still buy them via subscribe and save. I would recommend these to anyone."
5.0,Best cornbread spoon bread ever,Cant find this product locally so I need to order. Perfect side for enchiladas red or green. Easy to make up.
5.0,Best sweetener you can buy,"I discovered this sweetener a couple of months ago and have been a huge fan ever since. I have tried stevia, Splenda, and any other sweetener that claims to taste ""just like sugar"" and always find that they do not, in fact taste anything like sugar. I am not one of those supertasters either, but I definitely am one of those people who never drinks diet soda or any food that has been processed to make it lower in fat or calories. They never taste right, so because of a fundamental unwillingness to compromise flavor, I believe that it is better to eat less of something than load up on chemicals. Blue Agave nectar is absolutely as close to sugar in taste as you can get without actually being sugar. It is low in calories, tastes like sugar, is natural and has a low GI index. The only things I have used it in so far are coffee and ice tea and for these things, it is perfect. I cannot vouch for how it stands up in baked goods but I am going to be trying that soon."
1.0,Mother's Day gift dead by Father's Day,"Save your money or spend a few dollars more & visit a local nursery or at least shop around more & read customer reviews. I bought this as a gift for Mother's Day. It arrived in a timely manner & in good condition or what appeared to be healthy to a layman. She followed guidelines for watering, light, etc. But as the few short weeks wore on, the leaves fell off & the plant was dead by Father's Day (a month later). Unable to return or get refund/credit because the recipient lives quite a distance away. She didn't inform me of the plant's passing until after the time period for returns has just expired. I should have read the customer reviews first - lesson learned... the hard way!"
1.0,mint leaves,"I should have known not to order this on line. By the time I got it, most of the leaves were dead. Did not get much use of this at all."
1.0,YUCK !!!,"I am compelled to warn you coffee lovers out there.  I read the reviews of so-called coffee aficianados regarding this particular brand.  I believed that organic coffee has to be better than the others I've tried just because of how its grown.  Not so, buyer beware.  This is the absolute worse coffee I have ever had the displeasure of polluting my palate.  I now believe that the first reviewer must have some personal stake in this brand, or some of your taste buds have been dulled.  I tried to return this product [[ASIN:B000GAO9WO Caffe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown Espresso Roast, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)to Amazon, but was told that food items are non-refundable. My spouse and I tried to drink this coffee and after having 3 bags of this sludge in our cabinets, we finally decided to throw it away.  I thought of re-gifting to friends, but I like and want to keep my friends.  The only thing this coffee can possibly compliment is the garbage.  It's just so wrong that it sucks so bad."
1.0,"Fantastic product, but be careful buying it from Amazon.com!","I first tried this cereal when visiting a friend last weekend and thought it was absolutely wonderful!  I had a bowl every day of my visit and loved it more each time.  My friend told me I could order it from Amazon.com, which I did as soon as I got home.  I had my first bowl yesterday -- the same day the package arrived -- only to find that it was horrible!  The flakes tasted soft and stale, although the box was in-date, and I couldn't find anything wrong with the packaging.  I tried a little more this morning just to make sure I wasn't imagining things yesterday, but alas, still awful.  Maybe I just got unlucky this time, but for $6 a box, I don't think I'll risk another purchase from Amazon.com anytime soon. Too bad.  :(  If it hadn't been for this experience, I would have totally concurred with everything the most positive reviews said about the product."
5.0,cheapest and ship free from amazon,My dog was diagnosed with sensitive stomach and this is one of the few food that he can take. Amazon have the lowest price around and it ships for free. How can you beat that?? Thanks amazon!!!!!!!
5.0,Exotic and delicious!,"The Almond Stuffed Dates in Dark Chocolate arrived very well packaged in styrofoam with a cooler bag included.  The first look tells a lot.  The chocolate is dark and glossy--an invitation to taste!  The first bite is a delight.  The chocolate is delicious, high quality, super chocolate-y stuff with none of the artificial nasties in the mix.  The dates are moist, with a nice texture.  The almond adds a crunchy contrast.  These are just too delicious.  I'm getting ready to send the next order."
1.0,Artificial Sweetners,"Has artificial sweeteners not noted on the product page. That's where the ""weird aftertaste"" reviews come from. Stick to the Green Mountain version which is wonderful."
5.0,Supurb!,Buying the mix in place of the frozen already baked product saves so much money. They are easy to throw together and you just put them in the freezer and defrost them one at a time. More than satisfy  that chocolate craving.
5.0,Great Chew,My dogs love these chews and the fact that the raw hide comes from USA makes the product even better!
1.0,"You know how some organic tastes GREAT, and some... not so much","I am a HUGE fan of honey, I've never found a (or thought there existed) honey that tasted bad. This honey is absolutely atrocious. It tastes like somehow it sat out far too long and soured.. of course this is honey so it's not possible, it's just the natural taste of the honey. Like the bees took it straight from ivy and bark. I most commonly use honey for my tea in the morning and the rancid portion of this honey is so overwhelming that it ruins the tea, so I tried using it for cooking thinking that would be better, so I baked banana bread with it, after it came out of the oven I couldn't even taste the banana, the honey completely overpowered everything else. Now I'm stuck with five unopened bottles of this useless honey, what now?"
5.0,Wonderful Tea - hot or iced,"I am not normally a fan of mint teas.  They usually smell great, but are very weak tasting, no matter how much you steep.  This is the first mint tea I have ever come across that has a black and green tea base, instead of just a green tea base.  What a difference!  The Assam really kicks the tea up a notch without overpowering the mint at all.  It has a lovely aroma, and a nice strong flavor.  I can't say whether I felt ""revitalized"" or ""invigorated"" but it tasted great and that's the most important thing.  It has such a great flavor, I tried it as an iced tea and found it was fantastic.  Very refreshing!  Since this is marketed as ""health tea,"" I have not been able to find any Yogi flavors in a regular grocery store.  It is available in vitamin shops (online and brick and mortar), and similar outlets.  Though it is a trifle expensive compared to regular tea at almost $4, I would definitely buy it again.  Since it takes several bags to make a pitcher of iced tea, it is worth it to subscribe for me, which also brings the price down.  Highly recommended!  I also enjoyed the  Yogi Purely Peppermint, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6) , which is great for upset stomachs."
5.0,Our dog's favorite treat,"These crispy squares are lamb lung.  Our older golden retriever doesn't care what they are, he likes them so much he actually dances around when we get them out!  Even the cat loves them and comes running for a few crumbs when we open the bag.  Our dog is a somewhat picky eater so sometimes I shave bits of these treats over his dry dog food and he loves it."
1.0,They changed the recipe! No longer tasty,"But it's just as well as they aren't good for you. But I sure used to love them. They used to have a delicious taste and texture. They used to be really oily. When you bit them they had a unique crystally magic crunch texture. When you bit it it came apart in flaky layers.  Today when I bought one I was worried as the package was different. Also on the inside I knew it was different because the old bars used to be surrounded by a wax cardboard liner on 3 sides, now the new one had it only on the bottom. I could see that the new bar did not have chocolate swirls even though it was marble. The old ones you could clearly see chocolate swirls. The new one: first bite, dry, no velvet crystal crunch texture, no tearing off and leaving flaky layers extending. It was not oily. AND WORST OF ALL: IT HAD NO FLAVOR! AND EVEN WORSE: IT HAS A SOUR RANCID TASTE AND THERE IS NO DATE ON PAKCAGE. SHAME ON YOU JOYVA FOR CHANGING THE RECIPE. MORONS"
5.0,Excellent Chapati,"I recently ordered the Chapati and was very pleased with it. I sought out Chapti on amazon because I was diagnosed by an Ayurvedic doctor as a person who should eat whole grain breads for their calming effects but preferably without leavening, which increases Vata issues. Chapati is the perfect choice and was highly recommended by the doctor. I recommend this bread based on my experiences. It is a soft flatbread that is flexible so you can break it off easily, tuck a filling inside and double the bread around it, and also toast it. I highly recommend Chapati from Om India."
5.0,Amazing product!,"I bought a small container of this product (PB2) to try it.  Not only do I love it, but so does my family, including our teens.  Our family follows the Weight Watchers program and this is a wonderful way to have peanut butter without all the points.  Just ordered a one-pound package of both the PB2 and the PB2 with chocolate.  We make smoothies with the PB2 chocolate using frozen bananas, ice, skim milk and PB2 chocolate.  Delicious!!!  Tip for sandwiches - with the PB2 we mix 6 tablespoons of powder with 3 tablespoons of water (3 points).  When using it in the kids sandwiches, I add one teaspoon of regular peanut butter.  Makes 2-3 healthy, tasteful peanut butter sandwiches."
1.0,An ABSURD listing,"I use 5 Hour Energy - it's a great little product. But this listing is rediculous. The image shows a box, the description is ""2OZ Grape5HR XEnergy"", and the price is $28.89 - with free shipping too! Is that a good value? WHO KNOWS?!? Nowhere does the listing tell you HOW MANY bottles are in the box!!"
1.0,horrible!,"I bought this because of the good reviews but it is absolutely HORRIBLE tasting coffee. Tastes like very BAD restaurant coffee. Went back to whatever I find on sale if at all possible; Seattle's Best, Tully's or Starbuck's!"
5.0,Montana,This bread is great tasting. You can use in the bread machine or make by hand. It is a little sticky so I usually add a little more flour. It is very moist.
5.0,Better Than Home Made,"These lemon snaps are some of the best cookies I've ever eaten.  They taste better than home-made, with a hint of cracked lemon candy inside each cookie.  I would serve them at one of my finest dinner parties."
5.0,100 Divinely Delicious Calories,"This 8.45 oz. cappuccino drink contains just about the same caffeine (81 mg.) as an equivalent 7 oz. cup of brewed coffee (between 80-135 mg.). It tastes divine!  With just 100 calories, it really is a reasonable splurge.  The first four listed ingredients on the can are:  coffee; low-fat milk; sugar; and cocoa powder.  The cellulose gel and gum are probably what makes this drink seem thicker--as opposed to the use of cream.  Please note that, with 18 grams of sugar and 19 grams of carbohydrate, it may not be for those on sugar/carbohydrate restricted intake. Other than that, it contains nothing to deem it unhealthy.  It even has no preservatives. (I wonder what this drink might taste like if it were artificially sweetened and have no carbohydrates.)  I enjoyed it ice cold straight from the can.  This tastes every bit as good as the Starbucks bottled Frapuccino coffee drinks.  I would not hesitate to choose the Illy brand over the other one.  Coca Cola produces it in Atlanta, Georgia under a licensing agreement and it is a product of Denmark."
5.0,Awesome,"I ordered these candies because as a child I had some similar and wanted to taste these great candies again, and sure enough they were as great as I remember.  I will definitely be buying them again!"
5.0,Another reason I love Amazon.  Can't buy this locally,This decaf coffee is not available in my part of the country.  Amazon has it for a reasonable price which makes it possible for me to enjoy  more of my favorite brand.
1.0,NOT A HAPPY COFFEE DRINKER!,I love coffee & I love my Keurig coffee maker. What I don't love is when you order coffee and you are sent mostly tea & cappuccino. It would be ok if some tea was sent with the coffee but that was not the case. I will not be ordering this again; very disappointed in the selection I was sent.
1.0,Still way too salty.,"""1/3 less salt"" is more of a gimmick than a health benefit. How about 1/3 of the salt?! I miss the unsalted seeds my mom bought @ any grocery store in the 1980's.  We have turned into such a salt/sugar/fat craving country. Uggh!"
5.0,Fantastic Fun,"I came across cookies and corks at a wine tasting event were they had a Cookie Pairing Bar set up.. I immediately loved the concept of pairing cookies with wine and hung around the cookie  bar for a while tasting each cookie they had on display.. I knew exactly what I would do the next time I hosted my bookclub, I would create my own cookie & wine tasting bar.. So I ordered the 3 pack and then went  to the cookies and corks web site,  and paired my cookies with wine using the expanded wine wheel (each box has a pairing guide but the wheel is as more)  and got tips on ""how to create a bar"" . I was set.. My girls friends loved it, we didn't get to review the book but we did have a fantastic time trying cookies and wine and I discovered I actully like red wine (Pinot Noir) :) Cookies and Cookies is a must try, for every hostess or even great for gifts.. That's exactly what going to gift my mother for mothers day this year, Cookies and Corks Red Wine Pairing Box and my new favorite Pinot Noir."
5.0,At least the ingredient list is better than most,"My cat has been on special prescription food, for his liver, for about the last 8 years.  He hasn't been doing well, and is getting (at 14) pickier.  I went looking for something that wasn't just corn, and found this.  It is up there with the healthiest ones I could find. And he loves it."
5.0,Best White Clam Sauce Bar None,I agree with the previous reviewers 100 %.  I lived in NY and could find it readily available.  After moving to Glendale AZ finally found one store (an Italian Deli) that carried this brand.  I also had to pay around $4.00 a can but did so because this clam sauce is sooo good and well worth it.  Give it a try.  The price at a little over $2.00 a can is quite a bargain for me.
5.0,India Tree Caster Sugar Review,"I am very satisfied with the Caster Sugar I received on Amazon.  I could not find it anywhere in any of the large grocery stores I shop at.  The jars came in sealed tight packaging (which is very important to me).  The containers are a nice size (3 lb. jars) in a convenient 2-pack.  Jars are plastic (I prefer glass, but you know fussy me, as usual) and the plastic is just fine.  The shipment arrived faster then expected, wow...so overall I am a very satisfied customer with the product and the service.  Will buy from again."
5.0,My New Favorite Shampoo,"I received & reviewed the dandruff formula version of this shampoo prior to using this. I loved it and got great results; however, I was no fan of the overpowering scent. Happily, the fragrance in  this one is far less overwhelming, and the results as just as good if not better. I love this shampoo. It is my current favorite, and I intend to buy this well after my freebie runs out.  Speaking as someone with fine, oily hair which must be washed everyday in the summer, this leaves my hair clean without feeling stripped. It also does a good job removing product build-up. It's truly better than many of the salon brands I have tried. Overall, a winner."
1.0,this is not edible,this product was unacceptable.  The chocolate was all bloomed.  They tasted awful. I had to throw them away.I should have known better than to buy something other than Joyva.
5.0,Fabulous!,"These are soooo good!  All the saltiness and crunch of a potato chip, but 100% healthier.  They have no cholesterol, low carbs and 2 grams of protein.  I highly recommend these to everyone!"
5.0,GREAT Thai Iced Tea Mix,"Now I can make my own Thai iced tea at home that's every bit as good as my favorite Thai restaurant's! Fragrant, flavorful, beautiful color as well. Full 5 star ratings for this product!"
5.0,"Frontier Soup, Soup Tortilla South Of Brdr, 4.5-Ounce","Frontier Soup, Soup Tortilla South Of Brdr, 4.5-Ounce This folk's is one of the best soup's I've ever tasted !!!! I just can't get enough of this stuff, Be a great friend and give this for a gift that you will always be remembered for. We always have this stocked and ready for when the mood hits. Buy great product with confidence. RagenRat :0)"
5.0,What is in these things???,My cats are addicted to these treats and will attack the bag if left out for them to get to.  I have had to be very creative in finding hiding places...I think they would just about do anything for these treats.  Seriously!!!  I like being able to get them on a subscription basis to save a few pennies...great convenience for me.
1.0,Not so great tea,This is just our opinion (Me and my girlfriend) but we do not like this tea compared to the teas we taste at local Chinese restaurants.
1.0,"Buyer Beware if sensitive to ingredients Maltitol, Sorbitol, Mannitol!","This gum has Maltitol in it which can cause gastric distress to people sensitive to this ingredient.  It also has Mannitol and Sorbitol, these are all within the first 4 ingredients of the gum!  Be careful if you are sensitive to these sweetener replacements.  Just chewing 2 pieces gave me an upset stomach within an hour of chewing.  My mistake, I should have paid better attention to the list of ingredients on package."
5.0,#1bigguy,i've read allot of reviews that people say it's too weak a coffee but my opinion is i really enjoy this coffee and this is all i drink i can't imagine making a 2 pod cup of coffee bottom line i will keep buying this till they don't sell it anymore .
5.0,Agave,This stuff has a grate taste.  Great in tea or on pancakes.  Also helps keep me from over doing it and messing up my blood sugar.
1.0,Khrys,"I had heard wonderful things about these noodles, and with the low-cal ""included,"" thought I'd give them a shot.  They were AWFUL!  I rinsed them several times, but they still had a fishy smell.  They also did NOT absorb the flavor of the sauce I cooked them in, as I had read they would do.  Ate about 3 forkfuls, then threw the rest in the trash."
1.0,Bad for health,"Bought this because it was during a gold box deal. It caused stomach issues for me. Very unhealthy, avoid."
1.0,Tastes great...for 7 minutes,"Honestly, this gum lasts me for 8 minutes.  I just timed it again to be accurate.  The gum base hardens and the flavor evaporates.  Maybe that is an adequate trade-off for having something that claims to be Vegan, non-GMO, 100% xylitol, or whatever, but I'm sticking with some Wrigley's."
1.0,Threw them out.,"I adore sardines.  I'm used to the Bela brand, but decided to try these for variety's sake.  I opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food.  I tasted them anyway, but was totally grossed out.  In the trash it went.  Stick with Bela, super clean flavor, fresh and better sourced.  Totally different food product.  Try them with Siracha."
5.0,First impression: chocolate,"This is probably my favorite k-cup so far. I'm no professional taster so talk of flavor notes in coffee or elsewhere usually leaves me scratching my head and thinking, ""if you say so..."". But at my first sip of this dark, smooth coffee, I though chocolate. It's not flavored or sweet but, for me, it has a ""note"" of good, dark chocolate. Highly recommended if you like your coffee strong and full of flavor."
5.0,A Little Bite of Heaven,"Not just for Christmas, this is a heavenly treat that combines the best of both worlds. Chocolate and coconut macaroons are satisfying and present the time honored dilemma of how you can possibly only eat one. The answer is easy. You don't. I do turn eating these into a quasi religious experience by eating these is tiny, deliberate bites and chewing slowly as I experience the harmonious effects of sight, smell and taste that these macaroons elicit. If you like macaroons and you like chocolate, these macaroons will be sure to satisfy a sweet tooth,"
5.0,Ordered While on Sale...,"My wife orders these for the Kiddos when they are on sale and it's a good deal. As you may know, these little cans hold that disgustingly awesome Ravioli.  I usually take these on backpacking trips since they are pretty good, easy to eat and awesome for 'OUT OF THE CAN and INTO THE MAN' (as I always say)."
1.0,Rubbery and chewy,I bought this to go with a cheese sampler for a party. It was inedible.
5.0,Pumpkin Spice Marshmellos,"We wanted to make rice krispie treats for our classroom for Halloween. I work in a special needs classroom with 9-12 yr. olds. I found these at the store I went to and decided to try something a little different and we made the treats with the Pumpkin Spice Marshmellows. The kids and adults LOVED them!! We wanted to make more but none of the stores had them anymore, they are a seasonal item! So I searched online and found them! We made the treats again and they are still a hit, this flavor of marshmellow is fantastic and I will be using them to make homemake gifts for Christmas!!!"
1.0,"STOP, Read my review before consuming this product","Ask a Chinese friend about ""forbidden rice"" (&#31105;&#31859;), unless they are history buff like myself, they will give you a puzzled look.  The term refers to an obscure trade policy during Manchurian dynasty, not an exotic rice.  I will not going to bore you  with history here.  The story about emperor depriving commoners of red rice is a hoax made in America, like the legion of fortune cookies. Most fortune cookies are made in a wholesome factory near Atlanta.  We trust that fortune cookies are safe to eat.  ""Forbidden rice?""  There is a red rice in China, dark red, close to red bean.  The color varies from gran to gran. Its thick bran provides a pleasant nutty flavor and al dente texture.  The color does not come off easily.  You can get them from Chinese grocery store.  What is sold as ""forbidden rice"" at Amazon and Costco has a uniformed black to deep purple color.  It appears to be rice over-milled, dyed, and polished.  Drop a few grains in water, you can see color coming off.  And the color tent to sink to the bottom. That is a easy tell tail.  When cooked, the favor and texture of bran are absent.  If they use red rice, they have milled away its bran to make the rice easy to dye.  There is nothing wrong with using food coloring.  But is the ink FDA approved?  We do not know.  The label does not say.  I am returning mine to Costco.  I will ask Costco to pull it off the shelf."
5.0,Great Flavor,"Excellent flavor for suger-free and a fair enought price, too!  Swift service as well!  A++++"
1.0,NASTY tasting,"I just got these in the mail, and ripped into them anxious to try some licorice.  I finally decided on these after the reviews I read.  The texture is nice and chewy.... not to soft.  The Taste is nasty though.  Almost bitter.  It is like licorice, but there is this very overpowering bitter wierd taste.  It stays in your mouth and you have to eat something else to make the taste go away.  I even tried several pieces hoping it was something that would get better.... it did not!  I gave some to my children, who said no more thank you after the first bear.  One spit it in the trash.  Dissapointed since I now have 6+ pounds of this mess.  Wish they had a smaller option to try first.  I would recommend the regular fruit flavored sugar free bears.  they taste just like the full sugar bears."
5.0,so yummy!,i bought these as a gift and my fiance loved them! they stay fresh for a while as well.
1.0,Doesn't taste good...,"I didn't like the flavor of this root beer snow cone syrup, it has a bitter flavor.  It is a great deal tho so it's too bad it doesn't taste good. :("
1.0,Label should read: noodles & *a lot* of soy sauce,"I made this for my daughter and after microwaving, I saw there was a fine crack in the biodegradable bowl-boiling water leaked out all over.  The picture doesn't represent the cooked product. You need your own veggies but it only says so in the fine print. I looked for the carrots. They are not bigger then a centimeter. When she tried it: WAY TOO SALTY- she only had one bite. Pro: noodles had nice consistency."
5.0,Fantastic Low Carb Pasta - Highly Recommended!,"This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.  After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!  It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again. We have tried most of the Dreamfields types and enjoy them all.  Highly Recommended!  CFH"
1.0,Not At All Good,"We purchased this and opened it within three days of getting it. The popped product was very tasteless with small  kernels and very large hulls. There weren't a lot of 'old maids' so we didn't believe the product was stale as much as it was just inferior corn. We purchased a jar of Orville and popped it the same evening and there was much more flavor and the kernels were larger with less hull. So in the compost went the Paragon product, not to be purchased again. In this instance we feel we got what we paid for."
1.0,Don't risk your dog's life!,Why are they still selling this stuff if it can kill your pet!?! Buy treats that are made in the U.S. or make them at home yourself. Don't give this trash to your animals.
1.0,"Service was great; taste, not so much","I received the product timely and notification of shipment was the same but the product did not taste fresh. I ate about 10 to be sure it wasn't just that one. Sorry, I can say I would buy from them again."
5.0,My littte boy loves these!,"I bought these from Costco originally and my little boy (toddler) got hooked on them.  Tried to get more from Costco and couldn't, much to my disappointment.  Fortunately for me Amazon also stocked them.  It's a really good way of getting fruit and vitamins in kids. They aren't full of junk and they are great to have on hand for snacks, especially when you're on the move.  They fruit bars really do taste nice, I like them too!  Pleased I can at least get them from Amazon."
1.0,displeased,I wasn't happy with the quality of this product.  I have purchased many and all the bags had melted candies or semi-melted.  I will not purchase again.
1.0,Dislike - Not what's described.,"Dislike this assorment of K-cups; came in brown paper bag more like someone purchased coffee and all that they disliked they resold.  This was more a mix of teas not coffee.  I will never buy from this seller again.  Mix did not include any Apple Ciders and few I would say approximately 5 k-cups of coffee the rest was teas and decafs.  Hate this assortment.  Lydia,"
5.0,"***A HAPPY*BIRTHDAY,,,",I ORDERED THIS CHEESECAKE FOR MY BROTHER FOR HIS BIRTHDAY...IT ARRIVED ON HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE REALLY ENJOYED ALL OF THE DIFFERENT FLAVORS...HE SAID IT WAS A GOOD BIRTHDAY...CHEESECAKE AND PUPPIES...HIS DOG HAD PUPS...LOL...IM GONNA SEND THIS TO HIM AGAIN AND ALSO TO MY OTHER SIBLINGS AND MYSELF AS WELL...YUM...
5.0,My second favorite coffee,"I only drink decaf, so my keurig coffee options are somewhat limited.  Timothy's Decaf Colombian is a good medium coffee.  My favorite is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso, but sometimes I like something a bet less strong.  This is a good, mellow choice."
1.0,Very small pouches of cat SNACKS!,"My 2 small cats could eat a whole box of these ""pouches"" in 1 day. Both of my cats are small and very slender and not big eaters.  Be forewarned - this is not cat food -- it is a cat SNACK!"
1.0,"New formula is TERRIBLE and beware, they are 1.2 oz, NOT 1.5 as advertised.","I was not crazy about this version of Kay's naturals, but my husband did like the Barbeque ones, now even he doesn't like them. The new formula is TERRIBLE. Crumbs all over the bottom of the bag and not crispy at all.  In addition to this they have downsized the quantity without notifying us. They used to be 1.5oz and are still advertised as that. But they are actually only 1.2oz now. That's 3.6 ounces missing when you buy 12 packages.  The vendor has agreed to reimburse me a small amount on these due to the unadvertised size difference but the product is so terrible now, I will be removing them from subscribe and save all together."
1.0,Gross,"These cookies had a horrible taste, nothing like the sesame cookies we get in New Jersey. Too many flavors competing with the anise. Yuck."
1.0,Contains MSG,"The taste is great but it gave me a terrible migraine from the MSG.  Those who are sensitive beware.  Also, MSG addition is usually a way to fake true flavor."
1.0,Folger's price,This price is not good by any stretch of the imagination! The coffee is great but you can buy it at Sam's Club for about half this price. $11.88 for 33.9 oz.
1.0,Contains propylene glycol,"I did not realize until I received this product, that it contains propylene glycol. To be fair to the seller, if you read down the amazon page far enough, that fact is stated.  However, I find the thought of ingesting propylene glycol disgusting, so I am going to search for a replacement that is pure natural lavender."
5.0,Not bad at all...,"With the apparent demise of Red Bull cola (or at least reduced availability..) I've been looking for an alternative with similar taste, and I was hoping Flatt cola would be a reasonable replacement.  On a whim, I ordered the 16-pack. Well, it honestly exceeded my expectations. Nice crisp, lightly spicy flavor, great design on the can & packaging, and good energy supplement content. If you're looking for a Coke or Pepsi clone, this isn't it.. but if you want something that tastes unique with the added benefit of an energy drink, give it a try.  Highly recommended."
1.0,Broken,"I needed this candy for a dessert table decoration, All of the lollipops were broken. They come inside a clear plastic wrap and the candy was all broken inside the bag. It might just be my order got smashed or something, but not one was ok. All of them were broken. (maybe the candy is too soft I dont know). I wouldnt buy it again."
1.0,Watch your cupper !,"I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: ""This tea is not a real peach, either."""
5.0,Green Mountain Peach Ice Tea,"All that I can say is this is the easiest and the best tasting Ice Tea. and it is so easy to make, try it you will not be sorry that you did. How I make it, I put two sugars and two ice cube in a ice tea glass, brew it, mix it, than add as much ice as I want, Perfect."
5.0,Retiree,"We love this Honey Tree Sugar Free Imitation Honey.  It isn't only good on biscuits, but great in recipes that call for honey.  We have shared it with some friends and told others about this product.  Walmart use to carry it but doesn't anymore. So glad we found it on Amazon.  Hope you will continue to carry this product.  It is great and so was the service."
5.0,Delicious,This is tasty stuff. Very creamy and smooth. It cooks in my microwave perfectly in 2:50. I just add a teaspoon of honey and enjoy. My wife loves it too. Economical  in the 6 pack sold here on Amazon.
5.0,My cat loves fancy feast,"What can I say, my cat loves these. They're good sized portions and the product smells very good and looks appealing to the eye, so my experience feeding her is nice as well. She loves it and gobbles it up.  In case anyone is keeping track of Calorie intake for their cats, according to a canned food guide I found online, these 3oz cans are 76 Calories each."
1.0,Soda Stream My Water Flavor Essence,The glass bottles came in a flimsy bubble-lined envelope.  One of the bottles arrived broken! They should have come in a box with extra packaging. I was very unhappy and will NOT order the product through Amazon again.
1.0,Overpowering flavor and watery- Coffee lovers beware,"I found this coffee to be great at first, but as I started having it more and more I came to detest it. On the large setting the coffee is WAY too watery. Also, the flavor is very, very overpowering and kind of tastes like bananas.  It is a pretty good mid-afternoon or evening desert coffee, but other than that it is kinda gross."
1.0,Do Not Buy unless you Eat Insects,"We like mangosteen and we have bought cans of it imported from Asia in our local chinatown.  We tried this Organic product with high hopes.  First we found this mangosteen to be smaller in size than the cheaper stuff we buy locally.  Furthermore, in some cans this mangosteen has a redish tint; in others they are the white color we would expect.  But the last can we openned had an intact insect-apparently a large ant-attached to a mangosteen.  Unless you want to eat insects, there is no reason to buy this product."
1.0,Do you like baby formula and stale cardboard? Well have I got a drink for you!,"Wow - this is easily the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. I am a huge fan of soy products - I drink Silk, I eat vegan cheese of all flavors, I love soy yogurt - I've even dined on tofu dogs. I'm not a vegan (or even a vegetarian), I have an allergy to milk. For the most part I have been able to find all kinds of great substitutes for milk and dairy products. Because of all the great reviews I decided to give this a shot. First of all, let me just say that the amount of money you are supposedly saving is at best a stretch of the truth, and at most a blazing lie. I live in a relatively small area (where grocery prices are normally really jacked up) and I can find Silk and many other brands of soy, rice and almond milks for this price or less. So you probably are not saving as much as they claim.  Now, on to the taste. It's not just that it's bad, it's that it's SO BAD my stomach is still turning. I'm not sure why other reviewers are giving it a good rating... maybe they're of the mindset that if you buy something vegan it has to be gross, which may have been true 30 years ago, but simply isn't the case today. I've had all kinds of dairy free foods that were fantastic - milks, breads, yogurts, ice creams, puddings, sauces, creams, etc. and they all tasted great. There is no excuse for the taste of this. I'm not joking or exaggerating at all when I say it tastes like old baby formula and stale cardboard. And I know it's not just me - I tried this stuff on three other people. Two of them got as far as smelling it and then refused to taste it (good move since it tastes worse than it smells) and one of them braved up and took a drink... and then pulled a face and wiped his tongue on his shirt. My mother suggested that I try to cover up the cardboard taste... couldn't be done. Then she suggested I try it in baking... but there is no way I'm putting THAT taste into cookies or cake.  And please don't misunderstand and think that maybe I just don't like the taste of natural soy because I assure you that I do - I love roasted soy nuts, they're great. That is NOT the taste I am describing here, this is something else. Seriously, old baby formula and stale cardboard..."
1.0,A Royal Rye Rip-off,"The same item is $18 + $10 s&h from the Hodgson mill itself, regular price.  Will be one of the first links when you search online for rye flour. To charge $30 + $45 s&h is obscene."
1.0,Nuts were rancid!!!,"I ordered these to give to friends and my parents after discovering them at LAX. Unfortunately all three packs turned out to be rotten when I opened them. I purchased these on April 1st and opened all three within the month. So disappointed,not to mention embarrassed, for gifting a spoiled product. Looks like Amazon is stocking and selling old product."
1.0,Not salt- ammonia,"OH my gosh.  Don't call it salted when there's no salt in it.  The ""salt"" comes from ammonium chloride.  Eat more than one, and the fumes-- the fumes fill your nose and mouth and you breathe ammonia.  Totally gross.  I'm giving these away to the kids for Halloween."
1.0,Recipient didn't  like it!,We sent a case to a couple of young people living on a tight budget -- I thought some canned protein would be a nice addition to thier pantry.  I offered to send another case and was told 'no thanks'.  They report that this product filled with small bones and cartiledge meaning there was wasted product and time wasted in cleaning it.
1.0,Overall overpriced.,Do a google search. You can find quality invertase for a dollar an ounce elsewhere. Rather than $5 (or more) an ounce on Amazon.
1.0,REALLY TERRIBLE,"I'm a big fan of oatmeal; Quaker oatmeal, in fact. I like most of their stuff, and have never had any bad experiences with any of it.  When I saw the Oatmeal to Go bars, I thought that they looked like a quick, easy, and healthy snack.....which they may be, if you can get past the horrible taste and texture. I've since been trying to give these things away to my co-workers, but everyone takes one bite, and then gies me a funny look and then a ""no thanks""."
5.0,NOTHING COMPARES!  To DIRTY SUE!,"If you like Dirty Martini's than you'll LOVE Dirty Sue!  We've tried all the others and NOTHING can compare!  We were lucky to be given a bottle and we were hooked!  The only downside is that we can't readily find it in our area...HOWEVER, Amazon was fast, inexpensive, and we got 4 at a time so we are sure to not run out before we can order more! And qualified for FREE shipping. THANKS Eric from Dirty Sue!"
1.0,came complete or did it?,This gardenia tree looked so cute online and we love gardenias. It arrived with a note to hurry and purchase a tray to go under the pretty pot which has 2 draining holes. It was a surprise this was not included. The plant did however come complete with ectoparasites (something like green scales clinging to the branches) and white flies. It was also not as mature as shown in photo - more like 3 branches with scant green and yellow leaves.
5.0,Excellent Coffee,"Wonderful, rich flavor. Low acid, no after taste.  We have really enjoyed this coffee and will be purchasing it again soon. We are so glad to be able to get certified organic coffee for a decent price."
1.0,Not Vanilla,"My favorite flavored coffee is French Vanilla.  I ordered this on a lark to try a new brand.  The price was right and 12 oz packaging works for me as I brew in a Toddy's cold water system and use 12 ounces at a time.  Imagine my surprise when I opened it and discovered it's not Vanilla but some kind of berry flavor with a chocolate aftertaste.  It's not bad, but not what I ordered.  Now, Amazon says I can't return it.  Very dissappointing."
1.0,Not satisfied at all.,"For Christmas, I asked for some of these deep fried peanuts (I had never had them before). I received the Cajun and the Peanut Brittle flavors. The Cajun are awful. I cannot taste the slightest bit of seasoning anywhere, not even salt. They taste burnt nuts....yum right!?! I would not order again and will not ask for again. That said, peanut brittle flavor was not so bad, but I still wasn't impressed enough to try them again."
1.0,False Advertisement,"I am pretty active in health food, conscious social circles. Buying these types of foods and supporting alternative business is important to me. HOWEVER, this company consistently markets their products in HUGE boxes with tiny cookies or bars. I think the cookies are okay, but I feel this company knowingly deceives their customers by making the product look bigger. My husband and I actually laughed when we saw how tiny these things are. Regardless of how much value you get when you buy a box (Very little in my opinion), wasting massive amounts of packaging is inconsistent with the earth conscious advertisement on the package. For that reason alone, I will not buy these again."
1.0,bad pecans,"This purchase of pecan halves was the worst I have ever ordered.  85% of the package was inedible because they were small, dark, twisted and tasted lousy.  I also ordered cashews from Amazon (different company) and they were the best I have ever tasted.  These pecans are from the Bergin Nut Company.  Save your money and find a different brand."
5.0,Amazing product at the best price out there,"We have been feeding our son Plum Organics since he was about 5 months old. It is a wonderfully convenient way to feed your child quality, healthy, organic fruits and vegetables. We love the product and at $15.50 for 12 pouches it is the best price we have seen."
1.0,Is anyone else sick of this company?,"My Shih Tzu has enjoyed these treats for years.  I used to give them 5 starts.  But then the company started having inventory problems.  Sometimes it would take 2-3 months unless you were willing to pat $250 a box.  Now they've fixed the inventory issues but have totally screwed up the packaging.  Where they used to just place a cardboard strip in the middle of the treat, now they shrink-wrap it in very tough plastic.  You have to fight with it for 5 minutes just to get the darned thing unwrapped.  And they've gone backwards environmentally speaking.  All of the packaging used to be recyclable but now it goes in a landfill.  I've just had it.  My puppy prefers your chews, but I think it's going to be Best Bully Sticks from now on."
1.0,Coffee is great Delivery Horrible,Between my wife and myself we during at least 6 cappuccino's per day. I have ordered Coffee Bean Direct several times and the product is great. Amazon has gone to FedEx for shipping and they are the worst.  What used to take one day with UPS now takes 4 days with Fedex. This is the last time I buy this from Amazon!!
1.0,"We examined their claims, gave it a taste-test, & found multiple problems with Zevia...But here's a solution! (Read on)","First, my household is a low-carb, low-glycemic index, and zero corn syrup household. We have been looking for alternative *natural* sweeteners for quite some time because our doctor has serious warnings (and lots of research) against chemical-based sugar substitutes like aspartame, saccharine, and splenda.  Stevia is our favorite sweetener - usually from a bottle, or as a raw leaf. The problem is, we can find very few products (like snack bars, soda, cookies, etc) which use Stevia.  So we were excited to meet the people from Zevia at the trade show in which they rolled out this product (2007)... and we were among the first people in the country to taste a stevia-flavored soda!  At the trade show, the company gave out mini-cans of selected flavors, and we were super impressed. The taste is different from mainstream root beer, cola, and ginger ale products ... but it was sweet, sparkly, and had a nice bite. No awful aspartame aftertaste!  We came home excited to order our first batch for home/personal use. To our disappointment, we found several discrepancies between their product & literature at the trade show, and the actual product rolled out.  First, they decided to add caffeine to many of the flavors (not the root beer), but this ruined most of the flavors for us & makes their ""all natural"" claim a bit disingenuous.  Next, we were told by company reps that the soda contains only purified water, stevia, and citric acid. To our surprise, when the ingredients were published on the can (FDA standards), we found that the PRIMARY sweetener is an artificial chemical called eurethrytol (2nd ingredient), not Stevia (5th ingredient). Drinking a 12 ounce can of ginger root beer flavored Zevia had the same effect on me as eating 4 maltitol-based chocolate bars (LOTS of stomach problems).  Finally, they claim this is a zero calorie drink, but erythritol does indeed contain calories - about 25 for the can. And at $1 per can, the price is just to high. This product was a disappointment all around.  SOLUTION!!  Ok, so you're wanting a safe, natural, great tasting soda without side effects? All you need are 3 ingredients: Seltzer Water, Bottle of liquid Sweet Leaf Stevia, and (secret ingredient) citric acid.  Seltzer water is widely available at any grocery store. You'll find the other two ingredients at your health food store (we buy citric acid in the bulk section of our local apothecary, under $1 per ounce).  For one serving of soda (12 ounce) add 15-20 drops of liquid Stevia, and just a *PINCH* (1/8th teaspoon?) of citric acid. The Stevia sweetens and flavors, and makes a very nice drink. But the citric acid adds that ""bite"" that makes a cola taste like a cola!  Our favorite Sweet Leaf flavors are: Root Beer, Cinnamon, Orange, & Apricot. This method is actually much cheaper than cans of Zevia, tastes better, broader variety of flavors, super portable (we travel with a little pouch of citric acid & a bottle of Sweet Leaf), and it's truly natural!  Three more notes for health-conscious people: (1) We have tried many off-brand bottles of liquid Stevia, and they are all just fine. HOWEVER, many of the off-brands use a grain alcohol base, which tastes awful in soda (unless you're used to that sort of thing! Ha Ha...). So other brands are fine for cooking, but at this time I recommend Sweet Leaf for mixing drinks (just purified Stevia + water).  (2) Aluminum cans are a disaster for the environment (takes one 12oz can of gasoline to melt down/recycle 4 new aluminum cans). So I recommend bottles of Seltzer water instead.  And, (3) artificial carbonation robs your body of magnesium & other things. Instead, opt for naturally sparkling water, like Pellegrino. We usually pay $1.15 for a 1-liter bottle of naturally sparkling mineral water, no additives, and it has lots of healthy minerals. GOOD LUCK in your continued journey for better health!"
1.0,"Good idea, but....","I bought these from my vet, but my cat won't touch them. They might as well be rocks for all the interest he showed in them. He sniffed it a little and walked away, never even putting it in his mouth. I wish I could have gotten a sample before I wasted my money."
1.0,Gacky noodles,"I was so excited to try these noodles but very very disappointed. It wasn't the smell, which is basically rinsed away when you wash them before cooking. It was the consistency of this noodle, the texture was very slimy and difficult to register as a noodle in my mouth. My husband did like them and I'll fix them for him but they are an absolute no-go for me."
5.0,Neat new more enviromentally friendly K-Cup Option,"I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.  This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++"
1.0,Worst flowers recieived,"These were the worst flowers I ever received in the mail. The flowers were mostly dead, with the bulbs falling off. The advertisement claimed 10 stems, but I only received 5 stems. The flowers also arrived late."
5.0,"Great texture, flavor","This mix is wonderful - it makes having cookies easy, even for GF needs.  I don't have any trouble with dairy, though, so I do add in a few more choco chips ;)"
5.0,The best taste and quality....,"This brand may be a little more expensive but I feel it is well worth it. For one thing we did a blind taste test with several major brands just out of curiosity one day and all picked this one as the best tasting. Most major brands taste like flavored water in my opinion. This actually tastes like beef. I noticed that Amazon does not list the ingredients so i went to Imagine's web site to see for myself. I copied and pasted them here. Thought this might be helpful. I care a lot about ingredients which is the second reason I purchase this brand. P.S. The chicken broth is also very good.  Ingredients organic beef broth (filtered water, organic beef), organic onions, organic celery, sea salt, organic beef flavor, organic beef extract, organic carrots, organic garlic, organic spice."
1.0,Yuck... they changed the recipe!,I don't know why but they changed the recipe or I got 2 bad bags of cookies in the last 2 weeks from local store.  I used to love these but they don't have the same chocolate taste.  I recomend Newman's.
5.0,Finally something keep my Jack Russell busy,"My 8 month old Jack Russell, Fritz, loves his jug. I fill it full of kibble and a few finely broken biscuits before I leave for the day for work and Fritz plays and plays for hours. I had to get a second one for him to have at my boyfriend's parents house because it's the only thing he truly loves 75% of the time."
5.0,Golden Retriever with food allergies doing well on Addiction food.,We were buying prescription Kangaroo and Oats food from our Vet until a salmonella problem shut that company down. The Addiction Wild Kangaroo and Apple food is great. My big dog loves it and she doesn't have the upset stomach and belching as she did before. Try this food if your dog has similar problems.
1.0,not satisfied with new one in the bag. got some yesterday and we both said it is not the same.,purchased 3 bag  type yesterday and both of us say it is not the same as we have been buying. it does not taste the same to us.
5.0,Excellent Product & Service,"(This page isn't the one I ordered from ... it had about a dozen reviews!)  I mention that because the other page had a number of customers complaining about the slow delivery service.  My order came from Carol Bond Health Foods (via AMAZON, of course) and was totally INSTANT!  The ""juice"" is quite refreshing and I suppose it has benefits for the digestive system.  I bought it as an ingredient in a topical pain relief medicine and because I trust the recipe, I'm sure it'll be fine for that, too.  I just drink the rest!  By the way, if anybody wants the recipe, it's free.  Just ask in the comments column for this review and we'll figure out a way."
1.0,Disappointed,"Low salt was the only benefit this product offered.  The salmon itself was the center spine section.  Lots of spine, lots of bones, lots of work to eat.  Quite a mess and disappointment.  Not the typical sections of salmon most of us are used to buying in either canned or smoked salmon."
1.0,less than great,Your macadamias roasted in oil are grossly oily.  I recommend that you dry roast them; they have better flavor as well as not being so greasy and fattening.  (Then I will buy more and eat more!)
1.0,Healthy? No way! Bland and oily.,"If you love Pirate's Booty, then you'll find that these Tings are exactly the opposite. Light, oil free and perfect mix of condiments makes the Pirate's Booty tasty, but the Tings feel greesy, heavy and completely bland. Do yourself a favor and do not even think of trying these if you're a fan of the other product from Robert's American Gourmet!"
5.0,The Kids Love These,"These are incredibly delicious. If you think that you can't have a Gluten Free muffin and have it taste delicious, you are wrong. The GF Pantry mix is great. Not only is it incredibly easy to make it bakes well and consistently. We have made the muffins plain and with add-ins (Blueberries, peanut butter) and every time they tasted great!  This is a must for those on the Gluten Free Diet"
5.0,"Great Product, Fast Service!",We have trouble finding cholula products where we live so this variety pack is great! The service was great and it arrived earlier than expected.
5.0,Never liked green tea before,"I am not a green tea fan.  My husband is and so I ordered tea for him.  Well, while putting it away I was captured by the pretty packaging (lame I know!), so I thought I would at least try it.  Sadly for my husband, he did not get any of the 6 boxes we ordered.  =)"
5.0,Best coffee!,"If you have a coffee grinder, this is the best coffee, I would highly recommend it! The taste and aroma remind me of sitting in a cafe in Holland, relaxing and watching the passersby..."
5.0,Great Muffins,I love these muffins and so does my grand daughter. It's something she expects to find at my house. I have diabetes and these muffins don't raise my blood sugar so I can eat them without feeling guilty.  I always have some on hand and eat one or two every day.  I'm so happy that Amazon has them because my local supermarkets have stopped carrying them.
1.0,Forget It!,"Worst salsa product I have ever purchased - watery, bland and totally unappetizing.  You couldn't pay me to try this product again.  Waste of money - Herdez, Salsa Casera in Medium"
5.0,White Jordan Almonds,"This product is absolutely amazing. The almonds shipped and arrived quickly and came in, in perfect condition (not 1 cracked almond). I haven't had the chance to taste one yet but I'm hoping they taste as good as they look!"
1.0,dried fruit,"the fruit is too sweet.  If they didn't add so much sugar it might be better. the blueberries were the best, then the peaches. the cherries too sweet."
1.0,Highly Deceptive,"This nice pretty picture sets the expectation, will arrive in a nice/plastic box. Mine arrived without even a plastic back. Someone just dumped (edible product)--into the box. I ordered the Orange as well (which arrived as expected--nicely packaged)--However, I'm positive the 1lb of Beans were simply dumped into the box (vs being packed)--as the box was no larger than a Shoe box (ie. not a lot of items in the box)--there was no busted open bag to be found.  Had there been a busted open Bag, thought ""eh--UPS, things happen""---but NOPE--someone just dumped them in a Card Board Box, shipped that and my Orange (protected ones) together .  I would think twice when ordering an Edible Product from Bice."
5.0,Best Popcorn Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My family loves the taste of the popcorn and our guest love the fact that I have a popcorn machine that I proudly display in our bar area of our home. When I say it taste better than movie popcorn is that when you couple our popcorn machine with a high quality popcorn product like Great Northern, you get a complete balanced salt, butter and movie popcorn flavor. Don't go cheap on the popcorn and you will never buy microwave popcorn again. Great Northerns 6 oz popcorn bag comes premeasured and you will never have to add salt or additional butter to get the movie taste that we are all after. Plus the upside, unlike movie popcorn where you go to that giant butter machine,squirt that liquid death over the top part of yor popcorn only to find that it never reaches the bottom of the bag. This has the same great taste without making you feel like a short order cook at McDonalds and each kernal taste just like the first. I am a part time chef (fulltime banker:)), I will never buy any other popcorn product again after eating this.  Kuddo's to Great Northern for a fantastic and consistantly GREAT product!"
1.0,Pretty nasty stuff,"I question the freshness of this honey.  I took it in an attempt to help my ibs and found that it was ineffectual.  Moreover, it just taste bad."
5.0,Pure Vanilla Extract,"I'm incredibly pleased with the flavor and quality of this pure vanilla extract oil from Kirland Signature Brand.  The price is great, comparable or better than any pure vanilla extract I can find in local grocery stores.  We used it in cupcakes and banana bread with a little pure almond oil and the flavor was warm and delicious.  We tried some imitation the time before it and we knew we had to make an investment in some quality extract.  It turns out, this is actually more affordable than the imitation brand we were buying!  We plan on always keeping an extra bottle of this in stock before it gets halfway used!"
5.0,A staple in our house,"I was thrilled when Amazon started carrying these aseptic milk cartons; they are great to keep around the house. Normally I buy either 2 percent milk or skim, but occasionally we will run out of milk and my toddler always wants milk first thing in the morning - we just pull one of these out of the fridge and no problem. Also great to keep around for those recipes that call for whole milk, when you don't want to buy a whole gallon. We've also used these to take with us on trips for cereal, coffee, drinks, etc. and it's great because you don't have to refrigerate the carton until you open it. We've saved a lot of money on restaurant breakfasts on vacation by taking milk and cereal with us, using the hotel fridge to keep the milk cold, and eating breakfast in the room every morning. Great for general household use, travel, cooking, or whatever you can think up!"
1.0,very dissapointing!  practically inedible!,sorry to say this because I like to support small companies but these are terrible!  They have a greasy coating and very earthy taste.  The sweetness does not even have a good sweet flavor.  I wish I could have tried these first because I would never have bought them!
1.0,Price jacked up...,"I just noticed that the price of this cat food totally jacked. (I was not notified either)  It was $15.??, and it is now $25.00 a box. I will be canceling my subsription to this food.  I will looks for something else."
5.0,Jade Sea Salt,Excellent merchant. Very good finishing salt. Use very sparingly. Samples and dispensing spoons included. Very pleased. would recommend and buy from them again.
5.0,great taste,This is what I was looking for and was missing it. The taste is exactly the taste as the one made in India so just loved it and remember my days back in India. Definitely recommend it.
1.0,GuaYucky!,Man this stuff his horrible.  Worst tasting tea I've ever experienced.  And I'm not not just referring to this brand. I would assume that all Guayaki tastes Guayucky.
5.0,Exactly what I wanted.,"I have been trying to drink more tea with stevia in it in order to cut down on diet sodas with other sweeteners in them. After hearing the advantages of cinnamon as a appetite suppressant and how it controls the blood sugar, I have also been adding more cinnamon to my diet. I came across cinnamon tea researching other types of tea and thought it was a perfect answer. I was right. I have been drinking some in the afternoon when my appetite starts to run amok, and it brings it right back under control for me.  Please note that the Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice tea contains orange peels and cloves. The Bigelow Cinnamon Stick tea contains only black tea and cinnamon which is exactly what I wanted. I hate the taste of cloves, and don't think it is fair to compare the two teas like a previous reviewer did. This tea is delicious."
1.0,FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Much to my surprise i received only one bone. the item weight is 36.2lbs and the original pricing is $103.2. when i called the company the gave me the run around for 3 days before i threatened to file a claim. within 5 min a manager called me back and said it was falsely marked and she would refund my money. when i told her i do not want my money back i want the correct items i had ordered. she said she was not willing to take the loss. This company does NOT hold to its word or advertising.... they tried about 10 different excuses to appease me. i will be reporting them to the BBB.
5.0,Wonderful product!,"I was very excited to try this out as I've used mostly the generic seeming vanilla extracts from the grocery store.  Unfortunately in Beijing its hard to get even that stuff.  I was very excited to get the package and as soon as I opened the bottle I was really taken with the smell, its great!  I can't do a side by side test of the different extracts, but I made some cookies and pancakes with these, and they were delicious.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this vanilla.  Also the people at JR are very friendly people and enclosed a nice note so it feels good buying from them."
5.0,Great!,This item arrived on time and in excellent condition.  I plan on ordering this again to use in my diaper bag for emergencys!
1.0,worse than cardboard,"looks and smells great, but has no taste... not a repeat purchase. calorie count is same as sugar free pilsbury"
5.0,Excellent Puppy Food,My poodle/bichon puppy can't get enough of this awesome food.  I switched her to this a few weeks ago and she loves it!  I even use it as a training treat sometimes.  It reduces the waste she produces and seems to digest well also.
5.0,perfect for the mom on the go,"With 9 month twin boys at home, no husband, and a full time job, life can sure get tiring.  Hypersonic energy gives me just the right amount of energy to make it through the day.  NO hangover effect, or edgy feeling, and a whole lot cheaper than Starbucks and a lot less calories.  I can still wear the jeans I wore pre-babies.  I would recommend this to any mom on the go!"
1.0,Couldn't be any worse,"These tasted like molasses and preservatives. This is how close to being okay it was: I ate one piece and then threw out every bag. I love dried pineapple; it's one of my favorite snacks. These, however, are disgusting."
5.0,amazing!!,I cannot have gluten or dairy...I happened to find these macaroons and they are awesome!! I cant get enough of them.
5.0,Delicious!,"These are great tasting candy. Everyone I have given them to enjoyed them! They last a long time, so are good for watching your weight."
5.0,Geat product!,"I was dubious about trying a non-gluten dough enhancer, but boy was I surprised. One tablespoon in my 1 1/2 pound recipe and the dough rose high enough to push up the lid on my breadmaker. The finished bread was very soft with a great texture and taste. The loaf kept much longer than without it. I highly recommend this product for folks who do not have a soy alergy."
1.0,Havahart Critter Ridder,"This product did NOT reach anywhere close to my expectations.  The seller was promt and easy to deal with, but truthfully, the product itself was basically useless.  Just my opinion, but I wouldn't waste my time or money on this again."
1.0,WORSE TEA EVER WITH OIL FLOATING ON TOP!!!,"FIRST OF ALL, IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BUY THIS TEA BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP AND ORGANIC, YOU SHOULD RETHINK AFTER READING MY REVIEW, BUY IT IF YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE SMOKE TASTE AND THE OIL FLOATING ON THE TOP FROM THIS TEA PRODUCT; IGNORE MY COMMENT AND BUY THIS.  This is actually my first review on product that I have purchased, because it is a shock to me seeing all these great reviews about it when it is the worse tea I have ever had! I agree with the 1 star reviews for the most part, and if I could give it a 0 star I would.  I know this tea is cheaper than most of the other organic teas, and being that it is organic, one would expect some high quality tea. BUT THIS TEA IS HORRIBLE. Like many others, I like the idea of it being organic, and to decrease in the amount of chemicals and shit I put into my body. However, yesterday when I made my first cup of tea with this tea bag, there were oil residue floating on the top, and the tea taste like smoke!  Today, I told myself, why not give it another try? It might be my cup's problem yesterday. Ah ha! same thing happened, the oil slowly emerge to the top again! And I know it for a fact because I always stare into my cup when I am drinking something. I even conducted several experience with the tea bags by using different temperature water (I guess it is a wise way to use up rest of the tea bags, since I refuse to drink this tea any longer). I was hoping to find something different, but every cup had the same kind of oil residue floating. It is disgusting!  Now I am still stuck with many tea bags left, and I don't even know if this cxrxaxp is good for me though it's organic. I will never buy this product ever! I wasted around $5 with tax, but I got to warn you all about this tea. I guess it's worth it? now I wished I would have listen to the other reviewers, hopefully someone will take my words to consideration before purchasing.  I saw one of the 1 star reviewer being questioned in comment section, and I don't really care if I get questioned because this tea does taste bad and I am mad about this purchase. Again, this IS my FIRST REVIEW, if you don't think it's reliable that's your own problem and you can go ahead and purchase this tea. Anyways, TAKE IT or LEAVE IT. This is what I observe, and this is my opinion and conclusion."
5.0,My cats love it.,"I divide a pack into 3 pieces about once a week for my cats. They are a bunch of American Shorthairs that wandered in from wherever cats come from and my wife started feeding them. Most of them are between 10-15 years old. They love this type of food, and come running when they get a whiff. It does smell good, and in a pinch, I might try it in a sandwich. Just kidding. Anyway, if you are looking for food for a finicky cat, this is the one."
1.0,Terribly Disappointing,"Senseo Sumatra Blend neither smells nor tastes like true Sumatra Mandheling. It tastes more like a stronger (barely) Breakfast Blend with an acidic aftertaste. This is a bland, boring, characterless coffee. In addition, the Senseo pods are very thin, with very little coffee in them, causing a very weak brew even on the 5 oz. setting. For a much better Sumatra Mandheling, stick to Java One or Molto."
1.0,Mushy English Muffins,"The Ener-G Foods English muffins look good in the packaging, but something in them makes them mushy on the bottom.  This presents a gooy feel in the mouth, and both my husband and I got stomach aches.  Won't be buying this again."
1.0,Too bland,"I bought this as part of a large order with other spices.  This seasoning is terrible.  The final product comes out chalky with a slight hint of jerky flavor.  Luckily, I ordered other spices that I will need to doctor this stuff up to make it passable."
1.0,Wish I had read the reviews,"I have bought many products from Amazon and usually have been satisfied.  If there is any problem Amazon will make it right.  I have never given a one star rating before and would have given ""no star"" if it had been possible.  Without being redundant I suggest you read the other one star reviews and then spend your money wisely on some other form of lobster.  In fairness to Amazon I did not open the first can until long after purchase and way too long to expect a refund.  The second can sits unopened and may possibly be a $15 mistake to be thrown in the trash."
1.0,My three dogs say no thanks,These maybe very nice fir some dogs  but my dogs won't even take them out my hand. I have a beagle a beagle mix and a mini daushund that are all very aggressive treat eaters. I buy them all kinds and brands and had never before found treats or bone that they wouldn't eat. For goodness sake I didn't think there was such a treat considering some of the garbage the are willing to eat.  Inexpensive so I didn't loose much just letting y'all know our experience.
5.0,Awesome meals and snacks!,"My wife and I go through 1-2 cases of these a week. They are a wonderful meal replacement, and also make good high protein snacks in a hurry. I drink one for breakfast on my way out the door almost every work day. It comes in very handy that you don't have to refrigerate them until you want to drink, as you can keep a case in your office at work. They're organic and surprisingly tasty. I like all 3 flavors, although the iced mocha is my favorite. My wife prefers the chocolate.  I've tried several of the competing products, and these are my favorite taste-wise. They are also high in protein and low in sugars."
1.0,"No flavor, considering the name and ingredients","I have had many ginger teas in my life, and the best I would have to say is fresh ginger root ground. Considering this tea is marketed as ""ginger peach"" and the ingreadients state: : black tea, flavor, ginger root, there is no ginger flavor and the ""flavor"" in the ingredients does not seem to be peach. The brewing instructions state ""one level teaspoon of leaves per 8oz of water"". This ratio gave it a watery flavor, and doubling the ratio did not improve flavor. The best way to describe the flavor in ""my"" opinion is that the tea tastes like my grandma's perfume smells...not the best. I would bet that other teas made by this company don't all taste this way, but this flavor does not meet my expectations for being called a ""ginger tea""."
5.0,Rich loose-leaf Scottish Breakfast tea,"I found this to be a very rich and satisfying blend. It is difficult to find loose-leaf Scottish Breakfast blend, and this is a very sturdy brew. The taste is clean, crisp, and robust. The price for the quantity is very favorable. I highly recommend it for those who are serious about their tea."
1.0,Spoiled Rotten.,"After feeding my children for two consecutive days with this formula, I decided to try it because they weren't eating like they normally do. The formula tasted rotten and spoiled. Never buying again. No wonder they've been fussy. I've tried the same formula, different batch and the difference is night and day. If ordering on Amazon, I'd order powder and not this crap. - Unhappy Dad."
1.0,Not good,"I'm a big matcha drinker, usually in matcha latte form.  This product (which I bought from a local international market) is not a good variety of matcha.  It's not even an OK variety.  It is quite bitter, and yet the matcha flavor is very weak - how do they manage that?  Another Amazon variety (sold by NP Trading, and by Vita Life?) is better.  I only use 1 tsp of that but I need to use 2 tsp of this and it still isn't as good.  I think I might throw away the rest of the giant package that I own.  :("
5.0,Cattledog approved!,"Great toy for short periods of observed play.  My adult cattledog figured out how to removed the ball almost immediately, while the puppy took several minutes.  Even so, they have not tired of playing the game.  After removing the ball quickly a few times, they will complicate the puzzle by tossing the cube around, batting at it with their paws, pouncing on it...and only then remove the ball.  They wait for me to put the ball back in, and wait until I tell them to ""Go find"".  This is not for the dog who runs off with a toy and plays keep away, as the thin rubber ""bars"" of the cube could be easily chewed and ingested (my puppy had to be told not to chew it).  Of course, all of the Kyjen puzzle toys are designed to be enjoyed by dogs playing in the company of their owners.  They are excellent training tools for ""wait"", ""go find"", ""give"" and the concept of taking turns (one dog waits while the other finds).  I work my dogs on them for about 15 minutes, then put the toys away.  They stay new and exciting that way."
5.0,Outstanding Deal,This was delivered as promised and I've enjoyed the use of this fine product since then.
5.0,No Ants Please,"The Product itself is Excellent; however I will only be able to use a portion of the shipment which I received.  The Packaging and condition some of it arrived at my restaurant in was POOR***LESS THAN FAVORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  The second package was damaged and infested with ants. I had to get rid of three tubs out of an order of twelve because the plastic cartons had broken open, pearceing the plastic bag outer wrapping which attracted the ants.  If more care and ""smarts"" had been used in the initial packaging process; the entire order could have been packed more tightly in the larger box which contained the greater part of the order; thus eliminating the breakage.  I do believe that a CREDIT is due me for the three lost Containers.  Respectfully Submitted,  Chef Sam Pellegrino, Owner  Pellegrino's Italian Kitchen & Catering"
5.0,My favorite,I drink a lot of different teas.  This tea is my favorite tea.  I could not find it recently so I ordered it from Amazon. Amazon has everything.
1.0,VOMITOUS,"One's first thoughts on eating this cereal are of the bathroom, and for two reasons. First, that's where its taste seems to come from, and second, because that's where any mouthful should immediately be coughed up. The best that can be said about Krave is that it will, one hopes, soon be off the market. Its commercial success, if it wins any, will mean only that America's taste buds have finally succumbed to their long-sustained beating at the hands of disgusting products that companies try to pass off as 'food.'"
1.0,Open when arrived,The item arrived open! The bag the item came in was cute and planned on using it for storage! There was leaking product all over the bag! Everything was half gone! I only got half of usable merch outta this! The soap leaves a residue!
1.0,No good,First of all it was mostly a bag of broken pieces and crumbs.  They were the thickness of a cracker and bland (stale) tasting.  I wouldn't waste the money.
1.0,What a Christmas Joke,"This has to be the Scrooge joke of Christmas, for the price it is so small only made 2 glasses. The taste is nothing good at all, just plain tasting it is nothing great.  Says you can get one quart, you only get two small glassful. For the price they charge, for such a tiny amount, the profit for them is very high. If you want something to just add for a tiny flavor, go ahead. But if you want this for Holiday cheer, dont waste your time.  Of all the things I have bought on Amazon, this has to be the biggest loser product they sell. I would send it back, but they said once it is open, sorry  Want to have a good Christmas, dont buy this to entertain your family or friends with.  Shame of such a rip off product"
1.0,true chews  chicken jerky fillets/bites,"Horrible product.  Don't buy this product it smells horrible, and check the ingredients, it contains brown sugar, sea salt, etc etc."
5.0,"Terrific product, fast shipping, love the subscribe & save!","My husband travels quite a bit so the FRS packets come in handy during the travel weeks.  The FRS packets are extremely convenient and come in a variety of flavors.  I have done my research online and Amazon seems to offer the best price with the Free Shipping for Subscribe and Save items and the lower price with the program.  If you drink FRS, this is a terrific method to receive the product at a great price with the convenience of having it delivered to your doorstep!"
5.0,Eary Grey. Hot.,"I bought this as a gift for my brother, and every day when he brews tea, he quotes Captain Picard from the Starship Enterprise: ""Earl Grey. Hot."" He has compared this tea to the teabags he had been using and finds this tea to be of much richer flavor. It is an excellent tea, there is no doubt."
5.0,The Rolls Royce of Oatmeal,"This is the finest oatmeal you can buy.  All you need is twenty minutes and the ability to boil water.  It's a little nutty, with great texture.  Add whatever you like, although for you purists, nothing extra is necessary."
1.0,It's Green for a REASON!  And its not ENVY!,"This is the grossest vile green puree of what looks like a babies rear has been near.... except for the chunks of cottage cheese???  Is that what that stuff was that was more like tofu, also in a nasty green puree... stay away...far, far away!  Tell you what if you want to see for yourself, as I have 5 of the 6 packages left.  Send me a SASE and i'll gladly poop it to you ... no problem..."
5.0,"This isnt your regular table honey, this honey heals!","I have used this Manuka Honey for various types of degree burns. Burns heal, faster, cleanly and leave less scarring. I also used it on a really bad laceration and crushed finger tip that was almost cut off from a door. The price might be a little expensive, but its well worth the price for the healing properties this awesome medical grade honey has. Look for either the MGO 400 or its equivalent UMF 20+. This type of honey is not like table honey, it a powerful honey that is only found and created in New Zealand and has great antimicrobial, anti-fungus, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and antiseptic properties. It can also be used for acne, skin disorders, and is safe for use in infections in the eye socket, nasal cavity, and ear cavity. It may be taken orally to provide great health for your digestive system and overall health. Do your own research and be patient, and you will see its great healing benefits. I highly recommend this product!"
1.0,Not happy with this product,"I have eaten pecans for many years and always enjoyed eating them. I ordered the Roasted Unsalted Pecans thinking it would have a nice flavor. However, the title of this product on Amazon is Roasted Pecan Halves (1 Pound Bag) (Unsalted) - I must have missed that they roast the pecans in peanut oil in small print further down the page.  The package says Unsalted Georgia Pecans -Ingredients: Pecans, Peanut Oil. K - Well I have never had pecans roasted in peanut oil.  When I took my first bite, I immediately noticed these pecans tasted strange to the point that the after taste required a glass of water to chase away the poor taste.  I also ordered Unsalted Pistachios Meats - same thing - it was processed with peanut oil. They tasted poorly as well.  This is the first time I am writing a poor review on an Amazon purchase. Thumbs down - these are the poorest tasting pecans and pistachios I have ever eaten. I will never order another product like this again."
1.0,"OLD. STALE, DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","THE HEADLINE SAYS UT ALL. THE CHOCOLATE IS VISIBLY OLD AND THE BABY RUTH WAS AS HARD A A ROCK.  THIS IS TERRIBLE, BUT I GOT A REFUND AND GAVE THE CANDY TO BEGGARS."
5.0,Best Snack Ever!,"As a boy in New York, I loved to go to the soda fountain and have a coke and a .10 bag of Wise Potato Sticks. French's Potato Sticks are as good (or better) than my childhood favorites. The foil package also keeps them very fresh. I have ordered this product several times over the years--not a single bad experience. Enjoy!"
1.0,Phew,"Sorry guys.. I tried it...tastes like some weird medicine the doctor gave you as a child...sickly sweet, medicinal, overpowering revulsion. Did you ever have ether or chloroform?  Really..certainly an acquired taste..if at all..I like martial arts, going to the gym, chasing women and cars. However..I'd rather drink almost any other alcoholic beverage.  Dr. Cusciano"
1.0,Horrible Texture!!!,I have gotten this flavor of slim jim before from amazon and loved it however this order tasted like salty cardboard! Expiration date of march 08 but these must have been stored improperly because they are nasty. I guess with amazon your rolling the dice when you order snacks. Sometimes they are good and sometimes they really really bad. Good luck to all who are brave enough to gamble their $$$
5.0,LAVAZZA ALWAYS THE BEST!,I have been drinking Lavazza Rossa Expresso for 25 years.But I have been getting it directly from family members in Italy for the whole time.I was incredibly surprised that Amazon had it!My family is in Rome and they bring it by the dozen for me.It's so cool that now I don't have to wait for my family to go to Rome to get my expresso coffee.AMAZON RULES!
1.0,Not what I expected.,Somewhere I must have missed the wording BAR. The item as a bar did not work for my uses. The taste was restrictive in use. Other than that great product.
1.0,Why so EXPENSIVE?????????,"Why are these so EXPENSIVE on here????  I have been buying these exact bars at Walmart in a 5 pk for $5.50 a box for the last 3 yrs. That comes to $22.00 for the same amount you are charging 50 something for.  These bars are by far my favorite Atkins bars, tastes much like a Snickers, but this price is REDICULOUS!!!!"
5.0,SO so goodI a,"I am so in love with these Mangos! Seriously the best dried mango you can get. I could eat them all day long. But I won't. Sugar. You know. But still, highly recommend these for any mango lovers!"
5.0,Excelent,"This product was exactly what i was looking for, its 100 percent organic and tastes very good, i highly recommend it."
1.0,Not as advertised,"I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed. ""Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness"". I beg to differ. The ""regular"" size is quoted as 9/16"" thickness. The product I received is less than 4/16"" in thickness. Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised. My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.  On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up. While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat."
1.0,used to be my favorite,"This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use.  Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products.  SO, I've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now using  Stevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3) ."
1.0,RIPOFF,"Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item. Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up with uneven done-ness. If you want best quality, your best bet would be to look for stem-free (caps only) variety even though they tend to cost more. From one gourmet chef to another, hope it helps."
5.0,really makes a difference in taste,"My sister in law made biscuits and I couldn't figure out why hers tasted better, until she told me about aluminum free baking powder. It really makes a difference in taste without sacrificing texture or lift. Great product, and now my biscuits taste good too!"
5.0,Delicious Nutritious Non-nuclear Salt at a Great Price,"I love salt and use a variety of salts to keep my blood pressure up in the normal range.  This salt, I think, may be the same as that sold by David Wolfe's LongevityWarehouse but you get twice as much for roughly the same price.  Not only are the descriptions similar, but comparing the salts side-by-side, they have the exact same color, flavor, texture, grind, fragrance, etc in my opinion.  Himalayan salt is definitely much cleaner than sea salt ever since the Fukushima plant began leaking radiation into the Pacific Ocean last year if not before.  Many people are unaware of this because the major television stations are not broadcasting information that would incriminate their owners but just google or YouTube search if you want to know what is happening and what your government is not doing about it.  I definitely recommend boycotting major media and getting your news from alternative sources like ENENews which covers what university professors and doctors say is the real truth.  If the sea salt wasn't harvested before Fukushima started dumping nuclear waste, it is just too risky to ingest.  This salt is from the Himalayas which may be just as far from Fukushima's dumping ground as you can get!"
5.0,These noodles are great,"I have to say I was very skeptical about these Miracle Noodles.  They are on this high protein meal plan, so I decided to try them to add variety to my meals.  Taking them out of the package I was still skeptical; blanching them in the water I was still skeptical.  Once I added them to so WF Alfredo sauce with chicken strips I was pleasantly surprised.  The texture is a lot like regular pasta, they take on the flavor of the dish you are cooking and considering the fact that they are high fiber and no calories they will be in many more of my dishes.  Even my 10 year old picky eater loved them; the best part is that she could not tell the difference."
5.0,Bliss,"This is the only decaffeinated tea, that tastes as good as regular tea.  It is divine and I love to start each day with at least one cup."
5.0,love this mix!,"I read a lot of reviews for different samplers available and am very happy I choose this!  I received 50 different k cups and all were in great condition.  It came with a wide variety of coffee (flavored, regular, decaf), teas, hot chocolate and a couple seasonal.  These came loose in a USPS box but was packed neatly.  This was a great way to try something knew without having to buy a whole box...and I will order again!"
1.0,Find these in a store to try first and they only contain 10% juice,"I bought these without trying first because the price was at a 50% discount and I didn't want to miss the low price. After trying one I really wish I would have waited and tried to find a single to taste first, now I have 31 of these left and don't see them moving out of the box very fast, if at all. My 6 year old also tried it, and I was really hoping he would like it because he's who I bought them for, but he was less than thrilled, so I'm pretty sure he won't be running to get one. I would say that these would probably be best if a child has never had sugar ever, or very little, and doesn't know the difference in taste."
5.0,bulk watermelon jollies,we only want the watermelon jollies and cannot find them in any stores to buy so we order them over the internet. excellent product and amazing low prices. the company that we ordered them from is awesome. very quick to fill order and ship it out. Will definitely order from them again in the near future. Larry and Barb
5.0,now that's a cup of coffee,This coffee is one of the best choices for the Keurig Brewers. The amount that is shipped is almost ridiculous because there's so many cups there in those two boxes. Thanks Green Mountain!
5.0,These Are Great!,"I have 4 Dogs.... ages 12 , 6 , 2 and 8 months.... All of my dogs love these..... The 8 month old is going through a teething stage and she used to chew on anything and everything she could get a hold of... But since I got these she wont chew on anything else she keeps carrying around her Pork Chomps Twist and chews on it all day long....."
5.0,Great Little Candies!,I'm surprised at the other person's review -I came here looking for them after finding them in a local discount store that no longer has them. They do have a distinct ginger taste & contain ginger oil. I've been sick this past week & the ginger candies have helped settle my nausea & soothe my very raw throat. I came looking for them to order more!
5.0,GOOOOD TAFFY,"IF YOU LOVE TAFFY LIKE ME THEN YOU WILL LOVE THIS,IT DID'NT LAST MORE THEN A FEW DAYS A HOLE POUND AND A HALF GONE THAT REMINDS ME I GOT TO ORDER MORE."
1.0,Worst of the bunch,I eat healthy choice most days for lunch and this one is the worst.  I no longer buy it.  It is flavorless (unless you add a packet of soy sauce).  I don't even think this one will make it into my earthquake food kit.
1.0,Not Healthy,"We used to feed our dogs this until we read the ingredients. Despite being promoted as a premium, healthy dog food, this is not. It is made by Purina. The first two ingredients are corn (not good for dogs) and chicken by product (not good for anyone). Buy something else."
1.0,Overpriced!,"I always by my Tabasco sauce from Amazon, the twelve oz. bottle for about $10.00.  I made a mistake while ordering and did not read the number of oz's on the bottle I was buying.  Because of the price, I just took it for granted it was the big bottle.  I was shocked when I saw the size of the bottle.  I can hardly believe I bought such a small bottle for that price.  In my opinion this item is grossly overpriced."
1.0,ASPARA-GROSS,NASTY NASTY stuff taste like TIN there is woody chunks mixed in when heated it looks like strained baby food. will NEVER NEVER buy ASPARAGUS in a can again. shipping was fast and will buy libbys products again but not this nasty stuff. if I could I would have gave it -5 STARS sorry LIBBYS your products are always good but not this. that was a waste of $11.09 only problem is you can't return it. this stuff should be called (ASPARAGROSS)
5.0,rich and strong--for decaf,I very much like senseo decaf which i've been using for three years. This is just a little bit better.
1.0,Sugar does not belong in peanut butter.,"This peanut butter contains added sugar, which is not what I'm looking for in a ""natural"" peanut butter.  Additionally, they remove some of the peanut oil and replace it with palm oil, which is cheaper and environmentally suspect in its harvesting.  I understand that these are all products that are of a nature-based origin, but adding ingredients to something that is already quite natural (blend your peanuts - you've got peanut butter!) makes it not natural in my eyes."
1.0,Pappys What??,I have tried two bottles of this TEA?? There is no way you can get a GOOD cup of sassafras tea from any combination of mixture...!!! Save your money or go find a root to boil..!! This stuff is a joke..!!
5.0,This is my fuel,"I've tried many others over the past 5 marathons but my body loves the strawberry banana power gels the best for those long runs and races. They are easy to carry, store well in pockets or under gloves, and digest well with some water or light sports drink.  Hint - I enjoy keeping the gels in the fridge or freezer before taking out on warm days. I like to keep them on the ""solid"" side if possible."
5.0,KMR Liquid Milk,I have a very old cat that is frail and having a hard time eating.  The vets office gave me the okay to give her some the KMR Liquid Milk.  My cat loves it and her hair is very soft and silky now.  She has also gained back some of the weight she lost since using this product.  My cat is happier and so am I.
5.0,These things freaking ROCK!,"Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds)."
5.0,"I Second ""Best Granola Ever""....No Hyperbole!","Seriously, not kidding, the best combination of tastes and textures I have ever experienced.  I see many bags of this granola in my future...."
1.0,BUGS!!!,Bought this product from our local Publix where it's often buy 1 get 1 free. We ate it a couple of times and I must saw we did like the taste.  One day I tore open the packaging when my son started crying. I went to him and left the packaging on the counter. I came back a minute later and my countertop was crawling with tiny little bugs that could have been mistaken for spices if they weren't moving! I emptied the back in a zip-loc and it was full of these little bugs crawling around. If I would of put the packaging directly in the water i'm sure the bugs would have died instantly in the water.  I was completely disgusted and called the company. The woman on the line was completely unfazed saying it seemed that my product was contaminated and that these things happen! Happen to who?!! She continued to say she could send me free boxes or some coupons if I would provide my address. I informed her that the last thing I want is an other box of this stuff in my house and hung up. DO NOT BUY!
5.0,Great soup with a few extra ingredients,"By itself this soup is a little plain so I simply use it as a 'starter' for a really tasty meal. I saute a few carrots, half an onion, and a few stalks of celery and then add them to a couple cans of the simmering soup. I'm not a vegetarian so I also add a bit of cooked meat (whatever I have in the fridge .. usually ground pork or chicken, or chopped chicken breast). This is a huge favorite of every person in my family. Cooked this way it makes a hearty and delicious meal which can be served over whole grain rice or with a slice of whole grain bread. Yum!"
1.0,Food caused big problems,"When I first started my 3 cats on Wellness Core, I thought it was fabulous. Suddenly their fur was shiny and bright! They liked it, too! But then reality set in... A couple of bags later, all of my cats were losing their fur in massively scary amounts. I'm not talking basic shedding, either. Their fur was falling out..everywhere. This food was causing excessive hair loss all over their bodies..on ALL my cats!!! I was really worried, because it was bad. The rep at Petco told me when I informed her of this problem that other customers had noticed the same problem in their cats. I've read other reviews, as well, where people complained about a ""hairball problem"" with this food. This was no ordinary ""hairball"" problem, let me tell you. In addition, this food is absolutely NOT for cats with weight gain tendencies. I reduced my 15 lb male cat's daily intake to WELL UNDER 1/2c of this stuff plus a TBS of canned daily, and he STILL gained weight on it! My opinion is there is some vital problem with this food that would cause such hairloss. Either there is an ingredient in it that should NOT be there, or there is something missing that SHOULD be there. The Wellness regular dry w/ grains caused flakes in my cats, as well. The Wellness canned is the only thing I highly recommend from Wellness."
1.0,Starchy Pumpkin,"Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable. I've been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce, but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin. It leaves a starchy almost gritty aftertaste/texture. My only positive comment is that none of the cans were dented."
1.0,"These noodles are great, but not from Amazon.","I've had these noodles many, many times. From grocery stores, and even a small convenience store on my college campus. They are always SUPERB- some of the best microwavable cuisine I've eaten. The noodles are soft, the sauce is like a syrup, and the flavor is just unbelievable.  Not from amazon. I purchased these noodles with high hopes. I've ordered food items before from Amazon and NEVER have they arrived to my satisfaction or expectations. With these, I figured- ""Hey, how could they possibly screw up vacuum sealed microwavable noodles?"" I still couldn't tell you how, but it definitely happened.  The noodles were clumpy, and broke even after microwaving , even if a small bit of water was added- nothing. There was no life to them, and when your noodles are off- it's tough to enjoy a noodle dish. If that had been the end of it, though, I still would have tolerated the rest of my 6-pack, if vowing to never order them from Amazon again. But no, somehow the SAUCE managed to be terrible in this product! Rather than the viscous syrup-texture of the store-bought Annie Chun's, the packet included in this item was watery with clumps. The sauce itself was watery, yet the ""clumps"" were all the more noticable for lack of syrup around them. These ""clumps"" that do not exist in the grocery-store version refused to leave the packet without me opening it up and adding water, swirling, and then dumping out whatever one would call the ungodly mixture I had at that point.  Even still- I had hope for the finished product. Surely Annie will pull through for me, regardless of where I got this particular package from! No. What emerged from my microwave took me by complete surprise. In sharp contrast to the delicious noodles resulting from the store-bought Annie Chun's was what can only be described as a disaster. The noodles, already rubbery rather than soft- dried and shriveled over their 60 seconds in the microwave. The sauce, rather than permeating through the noodles as it usually does- had slipped past and collected in a small pool at the bottom of the container. Vegetable chunks and the mysterious ""clumps"" shriveled and died as well, without the sauce buoying their transformation from freeze-dried to fresh.  Three trials later, modifying this and that part of the instructions: soaking the noodles in warm water first, including water in the container before microwaving, mixing a bit of water and corn starch into the sauce, none of this could save what Amazon shipped to me as ""Annie Chun's Chinese Chow Mein"" noodles. In the end, I decided against leaving the remaining two bowls in the common room for ""someone"" to eat. I wouldn't want to turn them off this great product just because I made the mistake of ordering food off of Amazon. Instead, they made their way to the trash, where they belonged.  As I mentioned earlier, this isn't the first time I've ordered food off of amazon- Emerald Nuts that were ""off"", peanut butter that was ""strange"", a pack of 6 jars of Nutella one of which was opened, another of which was just ""different"". Scooby-Doo gummies that arrived with a crusty/crunchy exterior, and now this pack of noodles. It's not the first time, but I can safely say that it will be the last. Amazon's cheap prices are great for some things, but for groceries- it's just not worth it to this buyer any longer."
1.0,Fizzies instant drink tablets,"I loved Fizzies when I was a kid.  As I recall, they stopped making them because they contained cancer causing chemicals called cyclamates.  My daughter bought me a box of the new one's in root beer flavor and I was really looking forward to a retro experience.  This was the most God-awful thing I've ever drank.  It tasted nothing like root beer.  I would describe the taste as more like a really bad, chemically laced, unsweetened tea.  I ended up dumping it in the sink.  I would like to believe I've just lost my sense of taste in my middle age but I really don't think that is the problem.  These things just don't taste anything like the product that was out in the 60's and early 70's.  If the taste of your own urine wouldn't bother you, you might enjoy Fizzies.  Keep in mind that they contain Sorbitol which, in modest quantities can cause gas, bloating and assorted digestive ills."
1.0,Not effective,"I've been using Fleischmann's Bread Machine Yeast to make bread in a Panasonic bread machine for a number of years.  I recently purchased a package of Red Star Baking Yeast on Amazon, to try to save money.  I was very disappointed with the Red Star yeast and have just discarded it. Using the Fleischmann's yeast, I need 1 1/4 teaspoon to make a perfect small loaf of bread in 1 hour and 55 minutes.  This amount of Red Star yeast produced a rather pathetic un-risen loaf, so I gradually increased the amount of Red Star yeast to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Although I was able to get my bread to rise more by using this higher dose of Red Star yeast, the loaf had more of a square shape than a rounded shape, it had a coarse texture, and it tasted ""yeasty."" I've gone back to using Fleischmann's Bread Machine yeast.  Although expensive at about $8 per 4-oz jar at the local supermarket, it seems to be worth the price.   Red Star Baking Yeast, Vacuum Packed, 2 Pounds (32 ounces - 908 g) "
1.0,Don;t bother Purchasing,Product tastes waxy & not like chocolate.  It was quite a departure from the goodness & quality of other Newman products.
1.0,Terrible Tortillas,"These tortillas taste terrible, and they have been sitting in my cupboard ever since I got them. I wanted a tortilla with a great shelf life, but these are just ridiculous. There must be some sort of preservative they use that gives them this indigestible taste. I have done my best to give them some palate feel by buttering and frying them, but every method has proven futile and these tortillas remain unused. Do not waste your money."
5.0,the best pizza crust mix ever!!!,"We have looked far and wide for a gluten free crust. Hands down this is the best we've ever made. We add rice milk to the mix instead of milk,a little more liquid ,1 more tablespoon. It's the bomb. Makes a great pesto pizza. Need to adjust time with pizza sauce. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA+ mix. Will never try another one. Use the same crust for flat bread with salad."
5.0,Great Price,"I have two small dogs that both require medicating 3 times a day.  This product is a life saver.  They stand at the counter and bark to remind me when it is time for their medicine.  The pill pockets are pricey, but at Amazon you can save a bundle compared to buying them at the vet's office.  If you opt for standard shipping, plan on a good week's time for your order to arrive."
5.0,Good Stuff," Good Earth Tea Original Caffeine Free, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) This is the best tea.  It has a lot of complex spicey flavor and is sweet without having to add any sweetener.  Each tea bag is strong enough for 3 cups of tea."
1.0,Awful!!!!!,"""That wing sauce has to be the most disgusting sauce I've ever had!!! Thank god it has been tweeked over the years. I ordered the variety pack and was looking forward to tasting the ""suicide"" sauce, very disappointing! Who wants to eat a mouthful of black pepper....I thought ""suicide"" would be seasoned with habaneros or something, completely awful!!!"""
1.0,orange flower water,received the item and the top was also loose as was on the rose water I ordered. The bottle leaked all over the packing and label was soaked....  very POOR quality control. this is two items I have recieved with the tops open...  will never order from them again...........
5.0,AWESOME FLAVOR!,"This tea is almost like dessert for me.  The vanilla flavor is really there, but not overwhelming.  It's great in the morning, and I also love to sip it after dinner.  I'm so happy that Amazon came through again, so that I could order multiple boxes at a great price, so I'm never without this great product!"
5.0,Yum. These are GREAT!,I love Go Raw products. I eat a great deal of raw food and I travel for work. These are perfect because they are really tasty and I can keep them in my purse.
5.0,THIS STUFF'S THE BEST!,"We use this on toast, brown rice, pasta with canola oil, etc.  It's a major staple in our low/no saturated fat, unprocessed, healthy home.  I recommend it highly!"
5.0,barlean's virgin oil,i love this coconut oil; best i've used so far and amazon makes the price just right  .ken
5.0,Excellent gluten free snack,"I bring these everywhere for my gluten free daughter, and she loves them. I feel so good about giving these to her, because they are such a healthy snack; just organic brown rice and apple juice. And this isn't just a great snack for kids, but for everyone in the family. Mom & Dad love these too. I love how these rice cakes are just the right size. The bigger rice cakes you can buy were too big, and so messy. These are small and prefect to handle. No more huge messes. It's like your eating chips, but so healthy, shhhh! ;) Thank you HappyFamily."
5.0,Tastes just like asian coconut water,"I was initially a little skeptical about trying coconut water out of a can. But Amy & Brian coconut water doesn't taste like it has been canned!! It is fresh and refreshing without the yucky aftertaste that comes with other coconut waters like One or Vita or Zico.  And there are no additives like the other brands! All in all a win-win product! You can also find this in your local Whole Food stores (especially on sale on Saturday Mornings before 11 am), but with Subscribe and Save you get it about 4 dollars cheaper. I have no complaints."
1.0,Horrible,"I received these super late! And when I opened them, they chocolates were all smashed and dry. I was really disappointed."
1.0,Pack of 4 only,SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The package I received only got 4 inside it. Be aware of this product since it doesn't have any return option!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,Raspebrry Chocolate. NOT Chocolate Raspberry.,"There IS a difference! I was under the impression this was a chocolate flavored coffee with raspberry undertones. It's the opposite. I hate the raspberry flavor because it makes it taste like cough medicine. I tried mixing it a hot chocolate mix but it didn't work. That raspberry flavor is very overpowering. Also, it's only one star because I have a tendency to like medium roasts but this is less than a light roast. Watery raspberry coffee truffles with a suggestion of chocolate is a more accurate description. They smell good, though."
1.0,TOO MUCH  SODIUM/SALT,"860mg SALT/SODIUM in 6 PIECES= DECEPTIVE & DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH (VERY HIGH SODIUM LEVEL) , IN FACT  ""EXTREMELY OVER THE TOP"" BY  ""ANY MODERN STANDARD/MEASURE"" ; THIS  SODIUM/SALT CONTENT IS ""THROWBACK"" TO  MIDDLE AGES(DARK AGES)/MEDIVIAL &  ANTISCEINCE ;  DONT LET YOUR HEALTH BE  ""NEGATIVELY"" AFFECTED BY  EATING  ""EXCESS  SODIUM/SALT"" ;  HARDING OF THE ARTERIES/HEART DISEASE / DRIED OUT LEATHERY  SKIN , DIMINISHED COLLOGEN FORMATION(BRITTLE NAILS(TOE&HANDS) &  A MYRIAD OF  HEALTH PROBLEMS ;  SO  ""BEWARE & BE  FORWARNED"" LEAST YOU & YOUR LOVED ONES FALL  VICTOM !!!!!!!"
1.0,They must be disgusting?,Don't know much to say except they smelled funny upon opening the bag and neither of our 2 dogs would go anywhere near them.
5.0,BETTER THAN THE REST,"If you like coconut in your coffee, this is the one. I have tried the Donuts Shop Brand as well as the Jamaica Me Crazy and this one by far has a smoother roast and cleaner flavor. I use coconut flavored creamer which makes a heavenly combination. I wonder if Keurig is safe for using coconut water?"
1.0,"5 Gum, 1 Star","I usually like 5 gum. But this new stuff is pretty rotten. The initial flavor is definitely green apple, but it fades to nothing in about 15 seconds. Then it starts squeaking when you chew. Kinda sounds like you're chewing on a ball of rubberbands. And when you're done, your breath smells pretty offensive... like you've been sucking on a pile of old coins."
5.0,"Tasty, satisfying soup, but don't eat too often!","OK, so one can is 2 servings.  So double those nutritional numbers if you eat the whole can (as I, and I expect many, do). That's 400 calories, not too bad, but 180 of those are from fat (oops!).  Also you're getting 70% of your daily sodium, 1680mg. and 50 mg of cholesterol (16%), 40g carbs (14%), 6g fiber, 8g sugar and 20g of fat.  Definitely not health food territory. So, I wouldn't eat this soup too often.  But, occasionally, it's fine (in my opinion).  That said, it is very tasty and very satisfying.  The quality seems good, nice texture, good broth, good potatoes, nice corn flavor, OK chicken, and so on.  I enjoyed my first bowl very much.  Definitely a nice treat on a cold day.  An ok value using subscribe and save with free shipping.  Nice to have these on hand for a quick meal. Definitely one of the better tasting Campbell's chunky soups I've tried.  (If they could reduce the cholesterol, sodium and fat, they'd really have something.)  Overall, a very tasty and satisfying soup."
5.0,best granola by Amazon,I buy this cereal from Amazon on a regular basis. this is my favorite granola Amazon sells.
1.0,Unhealthy Peanuts - Hope this review helps,"I bought these and the unsalted variety because I make homemade peanut butter. I should have paid closer attention to the ingredients. These peanuts include cottonseed oil, a hydrogenated oil. I don't know why they don't just roast them with peanut oil. Well actually I do know why: Peanut Oil is more expensive than cottonseed oil.  If roasted with peanut oil these peanuts would be healthier and in my humble opinion taste better. I've switched to buying peanuts from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg ([...]), which are also available via Amazon Prime though unfortunately not part of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program. I just bought the last 3 cases (two unsalted and one salted) though so you'll have to wait until they get more. They are more expensive but better quality and healthier food normally is more expensive.  If you care about your health, stay away from hydrogenated oils and, accordingly, stay away from Planter's Peanuts. Once you become accustomed to the taste of unadultarated peanuts you'll never go back.  It's been a while since I wrote this review and today, 4/9/2011 someone commented about my original review and the higher cost of the Williamsburg Brand peanuts. Of course, generally speaking, unfortunate as it may be, we often must pay more for healthier foods. Accordingly I thought it would be a good idea to update my review. If there's a Costco near you, there's a Kirkland Brand salted peanut that they sell, in a rather large can. The peanuts are pure and unadulterated and only roasted in peanut oil; no unhealthy cottonseed oil like the Planter's. And, they are, I'm confident either less expensive or most certainly much more cost competitive than the Williamsburg brand to which I alluded in my earlier review. So, in this particular case, provided one has access to a Costco, one need not pay more for a healthier peanut."
5.0,Great Taste!  It does work!,"After trying both SK Orange Mango and 5-hour Energy Berry, I must say that SK is soo much better in both taste and the desired result- energy.  I could not stand the smell and taste of the 5-hour Energy drink I tried.  I didn't even want to finish it.  The Street King Orange Mango drink tasted great and it gave me energy all day- even though I only took half of it.  I love that one bottle can give me energy for two whole 8-hour work days.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for an alternative to other energy drinks.  And, I think it is pretty cool of 50 Cent to donate a meal for a child in need through the United Nations World Food Programme for every shot purchased.  So in effect, this energy drink gives you the energy to get through the day and the proceeds go to a good cause.  Can't beat that! :)"
1.0,Not my cup of tea...literally.,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the blandness of this coffee. It had no acidity or backbone at all. Very weak flavor and the choco-brownie flavoring just wasn't my thing (thought I'd never meet a brownie I didn't like). That said, I really like the Cameron's Organic French Roast...pretty much the polar opposite from this coffee, maybe even too strong for some."
1.0,Dishonest juice for your honest kid,"This tastes terrible. The bland, watered-down taste appeals to neither kids nor adults. I found on the packaging that this is only 10% juice -- so 90% of what you are buying is water, hence the low calorie content.  As a test, I poured this out into a glass and compared it to a glass of water. I expected to see a very clear liquid, but what I found was a bit more strange -- the actual color of the ""Super Fruit Punch"" flavor isn't pink or red as imagined on the package, but some sort of turbid yellow. You can guess what that looks like. See the picture I posted for a comparison on the product image page.  I recommend looking elsewhere for better quality and value. Don't let the ""100% Organic"" marketing fool you -- these are no good.  A much better solution: purchase a favorite drink and dilute it 50:50 with water for young children. Better yet, teach them juice is a special treat and water is for regular drinking."
1.0,Ewwwww!,"Let me start by saying I've never had an alcoholic mojito.  If this is anything close to what it tastes like, I'll never have a ""real"" one.  I couldn't take more than just a sip.  The only way I can describe it (other than disgusting!) is sour and salty, all in one.  Good thing it's not alcoholic!  My 13 yr old loves sour so I'll see if he likes it.  If not, I'll pour what I made down the drain and throw the rest in the trash!"
1.0,Buyers BEWARE!,"I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use."

5.0,tasty,very tasty. not sure why i cant find this in stores anymore! thank goodness for amazon! I imagine i will be buying more once i run out. Marble cake is the best!
1.0,Disgusting empty wannabe flavor,The on-sale Vita Product Peachy-Mango was a hopeless attempt at what sounded like a fantastic tasty drink!  It certainly was anything but! I'd sure like my funds returned from this mistake of a purchase!
1.0,Not an Improved Recipe for Me,"Besides changing the bowl to a very thin plastic one that gets too hot to touch, the new recipe is not an improvement that I care for. It's too bad because the previous version had bits of dried mushroom that gave it a more complex flavor -- now it's kind of a blah generic spiciness.  Have to mention they fiddled with the noodles too. They are thinner, and don't have that chewy bite. Very disappointed that Nong Shim USA made these changes. I'll have to look for the better Made in Korea kind at the local Asian markets to satisfy my Shin Bowl cravings."
5.0,"Just don't buy one bag, save yourself the hassle!","I am just trying to help you out. Do yourself a favor. Don't just buy one bag of these. I mean, if you live alone, maybe you will be okay, you might be alright. But for the love of all things good and fine in the world, if you plan to open these around other people or ::gasps in horror::: share them!!! then stock up by buying a few bags, not just one.  Don't say I didn't warn you. They are everything an everything bagel is, but super thin and crunchy. Everything should be crunchy.  Sheri Gill"
5.0,another versatile mix from Chebe,This makes great cheese balls to eat with spaghetti. We have also used this for Pizza crusts as well as bread. Adding cheese to the mix and rolling the balls in butter and cheese before baking really helps accentuate the taste of the cheese balls.
1.0,"OH, Come on AMZ!"," DOLE PINEAPPLE JUICE 6 PK   One can buy this EXACT same product in most grocery stores for about $5.00, so what justifies this kind of OUTRAGEOUS pricing, not to mention the out of line S&H? Shame on AMZ!  This is a wonderful product made to look bad by this practice.  I use this in my homemade ketchup or pineapple sorbet and YUMM!  But go to the local grocery and buy it at a MUCH MORE REASONABLE price."

1.0,now contains soy flour!,"If you're dealing with food allergies as well as celiac disease, be warned: the reformulated Devil's Food Cake Mix now contains soy flour. This is possibly the nastiest thing Betty Crocker Corporation could have done. ""Hey! Let's take a product made for the specialty celiac market, and make it unsafe for up to 40% of celiacs, those who react to soy protein!""  Bad move, BC.  Prior to this recipe change, I would have given it 4 stars, as it is easy and convenient, but not great."
5.0,Yummy snack,"This is so tasty, but like others have said, it is nothing like corn nuts.  It's crunchy, but  not too crunchy.  Delicious."
1.0,One gulp,"The cat loves these but never chews them. How does that help with tartar control? It's so small that our average-sized cat just gulps it down and wants more.  For cats like ours, the treat needs to be large enough that she will chew it first.  Do these companies actually test these treats before they release them?"
5.0,Very tasty and SO convenient!,"I love rice and yes, it's easy to prepare from scratch.  But I often just don't want that hassle, that delay or that extra work.  This is a wonderful replacement for the made from scratch version.  The seasoning is perfectly balanced and it goes with a WIDE range of dishes.  Only problem -- I can eat an entire package at one sitting!  It's hard to maintain portion control with these products!"
1.0,They have no heat,I bought some of these peppers and they have no flavor or heat what so ever . They are a waste of money.
5.0,Mrs. W,The Nonni's Biscotti Cioccolati is exceptional in taste; love dunking it in hot tea!  I will be buying more of it!
5.0,Bread alternative,"These crackers are a great alternative to bread if you want to remove gluten from your diet.  I love them with PBJ, or cheese.  These thin ones are so much better than the big puffy ones normally found in the store.  While it  make take some getting used to the difference from soft bread, they really satisfy a need to have a sandwich."
5.0,Helped my cat's wetting problems,"My cat started frequently wetting outside her box. Many vet visits later there was no improvement, but a woman told me her cat had similar problems 'til she switched to this grain-free food. I tried it, & after 3 days with only this food she became totally litterbox reliable- not a single accident since!"
1.0,Weight!?!?!,"Comparing the size of the container to something that has a completely different weight is just not adequate. Give the weight, otherwise I will never purchase from this company. It's like agreeing to a contract without the terms specified. I'll sell you this container here with something in it, for 10 bucks."
1.0,Baby's Only - Only if you want arsenic (Recalled in Canada),"We used this product for many months only to find out recently that it had elevated inorganic arsenic levels equal or higher than the FDA standard for drinking water.  The company refuses to publish testing results, likely out of fear that they are higher than what the Dartmouth study revealed.  This company is not honest with its customers.  AVOID AT ALL COST.  My daughter will be tested for arsenic shortly - I repeat this company is not ethical - go to their facebook page and see the number of unhappy parents.  Do your research and find another formula.  P.S.- 2/27/12 - The Canadian version of the FDA has issued a recall on all Nature One products."

1.0,oblong,The color is that perfect oblong gold - yes should be. But I both the same tea and color is almost black and tea is dry. Not fresh. Before both from Adagio.com - always was perfect. It is better to pay $4-$5 more and get a good stuff.
5.0,My kids love sour patch kids,"My kids love sour patch kids, and there is no local store that provides the unit pricing available from Amazon for this product. The product delivered is fresh (soft not hard and stale) has great flavor, and the kids really enjoy it. We have established a rationing system, and 10 lbs can last quite a long time.  If you like to indulge your children, and are looking for a good value in a sour patch product this could be your answer."
1.0,JUNK!,This brand is chockful of artificial colors and junk.  Shame on this company for putting this crap in their candy.  I ordered 2 bags and when they got here and I read the ingredients I wouldn't even eat them.  This stuff isn't fit for consumption.  There should be an option for putting ZERO stars!!!
5.0,Best Extra Bold dark K-Cup out there!,"Amazon must have deleted the old entry for Timothy's Midnight Magic as it was packaged as 25, instead of the current 24 k-cups per box. At any rate, all the original reviews were also erased it seems. Bad move Amazon!  The below was my original review posted here at Amazon on July 17, 2007: My wife and I love this k-cup. We've tested all the extra bold dark roasts out there. In fact, we did blind taste tests and pitted Timothy's Midnight Magic vs. Green Mountain EB Dark Magic, Gloria Jeans EB Black Gold, Van Houtte's Eclipse EB, Green Mountain EB Espresso Blend, Green Mountain EB Sumatran Reserve, Timothy's EB Parisian Nights, Coffee People EB Organic, Coffee People EB French Roast, Tully's EB French Roast and Tully's EB Italian Roast. Yes, we honestly tested them all. Many of the other contenders are fine coffees in their own right and without direct comparison to Midnight Magic, they'd be a fine k-cup. But when compared directly with Timothy's Midnight Magic, we found we chose it every time in blind taste tests. It amazed me when my wife picked it every single time.  There is no way you'd be let down by this k-cup if you like extra bold, dark roasted coffee. It's just perfect!  A must buy for Keurig owners!"
5.0,Just incredible,"Bought these over the 2oz packages because its a better value for your money. All I have to say about these... HOLY COW!!!!!!!!!!! They are the FRESHEST sour punch straws I've ever had. Every single bag is always super chewy and fresh. If you can't eat a whole bag at once, roll it up and save it for later. Maybe the next day. But if you're like me you eat all your candy like it's going out of style.  If you were gonna hesitate, don't you dare. There are a lot of straws in here and they are absolutely incredible. Buy this. You'll be doing yourself a favor.  After submitting this review I'm gonna go buy another box of these bad boys."
1.0,Item shipped was 21 days past the date stamped on the can.,"The coconut water  Roland Coconut Water with Pulp, 12-Ounce Can (Pack of 24)  I recieved was about 20 days over the date stamped on the Can. The Vendor claimed it was still good up to 30 days after the date on the can."
1.0,Not Edible,Skip this product and save your money.  Buy See's sugar-free peanut brittle if you're feeling like something sweet.
5.0,Great for Diabetics,Anyone who has to count carbs and is a diabetic should check out getting Quaker Puffed Rice.  It's low in fat and carbs and is quite satisfying.  It's too bad that Quaker took its Puffed rice cereal out of the main market and that anyone who is looking for a low fat and low carb cereal has to go to Amazon to get this product.  Quaker has lost a lot of potential customers.
1.0,Ehhhhhh,"Well I bought these to have a ""Food Tripping Party"" with my wife. I had a spread before us of lemons, limes, strawberries, blackberries, oranges, and grapefruit. We both started with half a pill each as per the reviews here. I then took a bite of a lemon. I guess is was sweeter but not by much, though I was able to eat it. It was like a sweet + tart food which I guess is because of the acid in the fruit. I then ate another half of pill because the instructions that came with the pills stated to take a full one. I tried again. It made the lemons bearable but not super sweet. You would not be able to eat an entire be happy. I went onto the other fruits and the same thing. You could still taste the tart with a sweet aftertaste. My wife said this, ""Well it makes it so you can eat lemons, but who wants to sit around eating lemons all day?"" I'm disappointed BUT the price was cheap enough and it was a fun thing to do with my wife. I'll pawn these off on friends and see what they say. To all the people who threw parties and raved and raved about how everyone loved them, my guess is that they didn't want you to feel bad."
1.0,Absoultely disgusted,"I just received my Juniper tree best gift and Japanese black pine tree and I am embarrassed for the company. It took 10 days to get them (not too bad) but they were packaged poorly - crooked and upside down in the box and so puny I don't think they will live. I ordered another juniper from Lousbonsai and received a juniper in excellent packaging and 5 times larger for LESS ! Lou also sent instructions to call him immediately after receiving so he can educate a bit and to call ANYTIME. 9greenbox says if problems, take it to your nearest nursery and ask for advice. Really???? Do NOT recommend this site ever. I am going to do all I can for these poor inky dinky tress. I'm sure Lou will help! Shame. Amazon reconsider this site please. Just awful. ORDER FROM LOUSBONZAI."
1.0,Mass Quantities of Runny Salty Gravy with a Little Bit of Other Stuff,"I certainly cannot recommend this product.  It consists of a bowl of very watery gravy with a sliver of dry, stringy beef, a few small chunks of potatoes, and a few slivers of carrots.  It's a rip-off, in other words.  When a company sinks to the point of having to cheap out so badly on low-cost filler foods like potatoes and carrots, that's pretty pathetic.  The product doesn't taste good, either; it also has a weird vinegary flavor, and is far too salty.  Salty as in teetering on inedible.  To avoid wasting mine, I am adding dehydrated vegetables to try to make this product edible, and that's just barely working.  I hate to waste food, so I will probably donate these rather than throw them out, in the hope that the recipients might find them useful.  I live in the South now, where many people seem to like very salty foods.  I've tried a number of low-end convenience products, even though obviously like everyone else I'd always prefer to eat fresh halibut and bison steaks etc.  I'm not blind to the benefits of products like these, and have been trying some as an experiment.  I don't see any reason why such products couldn't be great; but usually they aren't that hot, if at least passable for their purpose.  But this one is truly bad.  I really do recommend that you don't buy it."
1.0,Instant Oatmeal,Product not the same contents as have been purchasing in local co-op for the last two years.
1.0,Smells and tastes like turpentine,"I've had this variety of tea from other sources, so I have an idea what it should taste like.  When I opened the bag, my nose was assaulted by a strong smell of turpentine - I thought it was the packaging, so I moved it into a plastic storage tub.  The brewed tea tasted equally of turpentine.  I did find that if you leave the tea out in the air, the taste and smell dissipates, but keeping it for any length of time in a closed container causes the turpentine taste/smell to return.  Even aerated, the tea has a very grassy taste to it.  Maybe I got a bad batch, but I will not buy a Numi tea again after this bad experience."
5.0,Delicious!,These are corn puffs (just like the gerber puffs) coated with peanut butter. What's not to like? My kids are crazy about these.  The 1-ounce packages are perfect on the go (or at home).
5.0,"1 Tequila, 2 Tequila, 3 Tequila, Floor","Just kidding about the floor.  You won't want to put any shooting tequila in these glasses.  If you want to shoot, stick to your shooters and cheap tequila.  If you enjoy sipping tequila by itself or with nice a plate of carnitas, these are the glasses for you.  I received two sets for Christmas 2010 and have not been disappointed one little bit.  I went out and bought two bottles of my favorite tequilas after I received them, both anjeos.  The first is Jose Cuervo (keep reading) Reserva de la Familia and the other is 4 Copas.  These are two very different, both high end, anjeos that you enjoy even more so when served in these glasses.  With the narrow bowl, you can get more of the aromas from the tequila without the burst of alcohol you would get from a wider bowl.  This allows me to enjoy the aroma and full flavor of the tequila with each sip.  As far as the durability of these glasses?  I haven't tested them for durability nor will I do so.  Like anything you value, treat them kindly.  Like other reviewers have said, wash and dry the bowl while gently holding the bowl and wash and dry the stem while gently holding the stem.  That being said, I ran these through the dishwasher before I used them the first time and they came out great.  But I was careful in stacking them too.  And finally, a tip if you want to find some high end tequila at a mid level price, go to a store that rhymes with bostco.  I paid 75.00 for the bottle of 4 Copas Anjeo at a discount liquor store.  For about 35.00 I tried a 1 liter bottle of Kirkland Anjeo.  Same deep color, same rich aroma, same sipping quality, and you get more too.  Tequila!!!"
1.0,Good food for those who hate their dogs,"But who hates their dog? We sure don't, so we try to give her what she wants and needs, and neither of those things are in this food.  The name says it all: marketing hype disguising a complete lack of quality. ""Hey Boss, this crap food made of crap needs a non-crap name that sounds healthy and nutritious. How about Beneful?""  How about Artificiaful?  The main ingredient is corn, which is nutritionally almost useless for dogs. I can almost guarantee it's also gmo corn, which is making our kids and adults fatter by the day while it destroys our soil as farmers dump more pesticides on it. And who knows what it's doing to us on a cellular level? While most countries in the world have forbidden gmo, we've had it stuffed down our throats with ZERO pre-testing. Human Guinea Pig Nation!  The next main ingredient is ""chicken by-products"". What, my dog can't even get the meat of the tortured hormone-laden antibiotic nightmare in a tiny cage that is the modern factory chicken? She needs to eat the beaks, claws and other inedibles off these poor birds?  Beneful?! Crappiful!  It's a disgrace that they're selling this stuff with all this marketing when they should be spending those ad dollars on real food for our dogs. Purina should be ashamed of themselves for claiming they care about dogs and then feeding them this swill, which is really just leftovers they couldn't stick in other crap. If this is what they feed dogs, I wouldn't TOUCH anything they make for people. Thanks for letting us know how much you care, Purina!  If you love your dog, and want to get the best dog food for the least cash, go straight to the Land of Kirk, where a huge sack of real meat-based dog food, chicken or lamb, with almost zero fillers of any sort and full of real nutrition, is waiting to make your pooch happy and healthy.  Or you could pay three times as much for this disgraceful junk that will only make your dog sick in the long run."
5.0,One of the best coffees I have ever tasted!,This is truly delicious coffee and it has the side benefit of making the whole house smell like you're baking!
5.0,My child's favorite meal,I buy Annie's Rice Mac and Cheese by the case for my daughter who has celiac disease. It is by far the best tasting GF mac and cheese on the market and my kids love it.
5.0,The name says it all,"These are some of the largest seeds I've ever seen.  They have ruined me for other brands.  The shells of these sunflower seeds are almost square in section, and they pop open like they are on a hinge.  The buffalo wing flavor is nice.  It's not melt your face off hot.  I don't know if these have any less sodium than the standard salted variety, but they don't seem to have the ""cure your mouth like a country ham"" effect I've experienced with the salted flavors.  You may not have experienced this effect if you eat human sized portions, but if you have a 5 oz. bag a day habbit like myself, you probably know what I'm talking about."
1.0,Where are the DinoSour Eggs??,"I might actually buy it if it had those. But seriously folks, just find a Sweet Factory in a mall and you can get 90% of this stuff for 90% less money. They're just trying to sell you on the 80's nostalgia title."
1.0,Not for bold coffee drinkers,I purchased this coffee hoping it would be a low cost alternative to what I buy now. The bold flavor isn't there. This is more like a regular roast coffee. The coffee is OK it is just not what I want in a dark roast coffee. I have not tried any other type other than the french roast and based on this experience I am not likely to.
1.0,Horrible!,"The stuff is AWFUL. Minus 5 stars. In addition to the awful taste, it actually made my stomach hurt, which never happened before.  I'm throwing it out."
5.0,Best Healthy Cookie I've Ever Tasted!! Pretty sweet!!!!, These cookies are so great! Watch our video to see how great they really are!!!
1.0,Worst product bought on Amazon...,"I bought this because the reviews were so great, but what a mistake! My kids hated it, and when I tried it, I hated it, too. Very little flavor, weird texture and strange mouth feel. Can't argue with the low carb part, and that's why it gets a star. Otherwise, no stars (if I could...). :0("
5.0,Love It!,"Patak's Mango Relish is my favorite to add to Indian foods. Open the jar, take a whiff and I salivate. Not spicy, but chock full of flavor...intense. I like to chop up the mango into smaller pieces then mix well into whatever I am eating it with. This is hands down my favorite of Patak's relishes. Hard to find, I am going to order a six pack to have around for a while. Delicious!!!"
1.0,pick -me-up,Bottles arrived with wet packaging from some of the tops that were not tightly closed.  A box of 24 plastic containers that were sticky.  Not a low calorie lift- 90 calories /bottle.
5.0,Yummy and Nutritious!,"For kids and adults alike, these granola cereal bars are worth the extra dollars. They have a unique whole grain taste. Great on the go snack. Waiting to try other flavors."
5.0,Great tea,We used to travel across the Bay to the import store.  So happy it's on Amazon!  And for a better price :)
5.0,Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red Tea,"One of my husband's favorite teas but not always available locally. With Subscribe & Save, he can be assured of a constant supply at a good price."
1.0,Contaminated,"Package arrived in the mail a few days ago in what appeared to be good condition.  The bag was properly sealed and didn't appear to have any holes in it.  I decided to try this out today, but upon scooping some of the rice out, I noticed quite a few bugs.  In fact, I've never seen any rice with so many bugs in it!  I'm not sure how common this is in this variety of rice, but I can say that I've never had a problem with Lotus Foods' products in the past.  Unfortunately, I have to give this product 1 star because of the extent of the contamination.  I'd caution any buyers to stay away from this variety of rice given my experience and the fact that it can't be returned."
5.0,just right,i love my oatmeal cookies and porridge but i couldn't enjoy it in a while due to the allergy. well now i'm happy. it's real oatmeal without the contamination of wheat and i just love it. i can enjoy it without having to deal iwth joint pain and bloating etc. it's exactly like old fashioned oats just without gluten contamination.
1.0,Not recommended,"I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.  It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone.  I will never buy these again!!!"
1.0,P&G tests on Animals!,"The food is decent, but now that Procter & Gamble are buying up Natura, this food is no longer a wise choice.  My main concern is not the quality of the food, but the fact that Procter & Gamble (Febreze, Crest, Tide, etc) conduct horrible testing on animals. They're not shy about it either. Look it up online. When you purchase EVO, your money will now be going into their pockets.  I prefer to feed my cats a raw supplemented diet, with Blue Wilderness on occasion."
5.0,Excellent flavor and value,"When I first looked at this product I thought it was a bit pricey (over five dollars for a small bottle).  I then  looked at the various recipes listed on the back and thought that it was worth a try. The resulting salad dressings and marinades were all quite tasty.  My family particularly enjoyed chicken marinaded in this product.  We have also used the product mixed with olive oil for dipping fresh Italian bread.  As for the cost factor - when I compared the cost of prepared bottles of good quality salad dressings to the cost making them using this product, making them up fresh with this came out as cheap or cheaper than buying the ready made dressings and marinades.  When I also considered that I could adjust the amounts prepared for my needs, and the additional control I had over the quality I decided to replace many of the premade bottled dressings with this product."
5.0,Moved out of state and couldn't find a retailer for this dog food.,"Our Bichon has a very sensitive stomach, so this is the only dog food we buy for her.  When we moved to another state, we had difficulty finding a retailer that carried this particular brand of dog food.  Ordering from Amazon.com makes it easy, and it is delivered to our door within a few days."
5.0,Flavored Coffee,Van Houtte Chocolate Rasberry Truffle is a most outstandimg cup of flavored coffee! I'm a just regular cup of coffee drinker but this is the most excellent flavored coffee out there!
5.0,No place else,"This is the best price for hemp seed.  I have seen hemp seed cost 15.00 USD for 13 oz.  Do not waste your money, these seeds keep well and taste great.  They are filling and affordable.  Stop looking, this is the best price!"
5.0,Great with pineapple!,"I drink a lot of smoothies, and this is outstanding in a fresh pineapple smoothie. Just like a Pina colada! Delicious. Doesn't even sound good in coffee, so haven't tried that. But over greek yogurt is also good. Be creative!"
5.0,This is an outstanding olive oil.,I love this oil.  It tastes of olives with no bitter aftertaste.  I did a review of all the olive oils on Amazon and my favorites is this oil and Baraini.  It is not necessarily a cooking oil as it is better suited as a finishing oil.  The price has actually decreased over the last year or so.  For the money this EVOO is excellent for people who want a good oil at a reasonable price.
1.0,"disgusting for humans, dogs liked it","I made this meal with high hopes since I used to love Hamburger Helper meals back when I ate gluten.  It looked good when I finished, just like Hamburger Helper.  But it tasked terrible, totally inedible.  No flavor at all, like mushy cardboard.  I don't have very high standards for food (as I said I love Hamburger Helper), so me not liking it is saying a lot.  I have the whole lot of it to the dogs and they ate it right up."
1.0,Mylar balloon flavored graham crackers.,"I am a fan of this brand, but was extremely disappointed when I tried the Bunny Graham Friends. I noticed immediately upon opening the brand new box that there was a strange odor. I proceeded to open the metallic bag, and almost instantly correlated the smell with that of a mylar balloon (those metallic helium balloons). Sadly, the graham snacks were impregnated with the smell and taste as well. I'm all for ""green"" packaging and such, and realize the hidden dangers of plastic packaging, but surely there is another way to package these without ruining the flavor or earth. I will, however, continue to buy the macaroni and other products from this line, but I will never waste my money on this item again."
1.0,Terrible taste,"These hard candies have a terrible non-taste.  There is a goo in the center that tastes like plain corn syrup only not sweet;  there is absolutely no liquor flavor to this product.  It resembles a stale cough drop at best....no kick, no zing,  no sweetness.  Yuck.  I will never buy this item again.  ( I checked the expiration and these don't expire until 2015 and if that's the best/freshness you achieve then forget this food item ) This is why this candy is just about 2 dollars a bag;  you pay for what you get. 2 thumbs down; save your money on another brand after dinner liquor candy."
5.0,I Liked It!,"I really liked this product.  I tried two flavors, this and the Black Cherry.  While I liked the Black Cherry better it had a very strong flavor which the rest of my family didn't care for as much.  If you are looking for an alternative to soda this flavor may be a good choice- especially for younger children who may object to the stronger flavor of the Black Cherry.  As for the cost and nutritional info- that would have to be a personal choice but for me this would be a viable choice to have around for my granddaughter, she loves carbonated beverages in a can and could be fooled in to thinking she was getting a ""soda"" with this drink."
1.0,Poor quality chia moldy,"I found the quality questionable but the mold growing inside the bad was scary. I hope Ruth's can fix this issue or recall the product. Ruth's Hemp Foods Chia Goodness, Chocolate, for Breakfast, 12-Ounce Pouch (Pack Of 12) "
5.0,Its good,"This is pretty good. The grains are not too big like some others, they are small and cook really fast, love it."
5.0,delicious dark chocolate treat!,"I really enjoyed Riesen and i found this candy thoroughly pleasurable.  This treat is dark chocolate on the outside and has a chewy caramel center on the inside.  Its taste an texture were a real delight.  riesen is different.  Unlike other candies that are overwhelming sweet and sugary, riesen is full of flavor.  Th exterior dark chocolate has a smooth feel, and a rich chocolate taste.  For me, its the flavor of the exterior that does it for me.  Unlike other dark chocolates which can be bitter this chocolate is only 45% cacao which gives you a great mix between sweet and dark.  I just wish there was more dark chocolate.  the interior of a riesen is chewy and has a deep rich creamy sticky caramel flavor.  again this caramel does not have that strong sugary taste instead you taste the richness of creamy caramel but in a hard format that becomes softer and chewier over time until it melts in your mouth.  This delicious long lasting caramel was excellent.  My only problem with this product is the lack of nutrition but im not expecting to eat kale or Goji berries,  i come to this product for pleasure, taste and texture.  My hats of to stock manufacturer of this wonderful candy,  i will continue to buy it in the future"
5.0,stays crunchy cereal,"This Cereal is not Sugery.....It stays Crunchy evn to the last spoonfull.   Add your own fruit, raisins, ts...if you like..."
5.0,Very tasty and great for training,Brownie goes bonkers for these.  They're small so they're great for training. They're also small enough to stuff the treat balls with.
1.0,Save your money,"I bought this and I am sorry I did. Tastes burnt. Not the Donut Cafe taste I was looking for. I even cut the little pouchs open and tried loose in my Bunn,but still bad taste."
5.0,Works AWESOME,I use 1/4 tsp in my cats wet food. I noticed a HUGE difference within days.  Not only did his coarse hair become super soft and shiny his tummy problem went away.  I bought this because I was at my wits end and spending money on vet bills was adding up.  So I thought I would just change his diet.  I went from commercial food to Evo & Natures Instinct canned and add this. I am so happy that I found something that works (he has was having problems using the bathroom and his feces would get stuck and then he would prolapse it would be so bad)  I am thankful that I found something that works for my little guy and I will keep using this everyday! Would highly recommend!
1.0,"Great sauce, terrible pricing.","This sauce is great.  It's not blazing hot, but certainly enough to add a nice kick to any number of dishes.  Unfortunately the price is outrageous.  My local grocery store sells the same bottle for 3.20 and walmart has it for under 3 bucks!"
1.0,Very strong malt flavor - not very vanilla-y,"We drink a fair amount of soy milks around our house, and we generally like them all. This one, however, was definitely not a hit here. My child won't drink it, and I must admit that I don't like it either. It has a very strong malt flavor, which I have never found in any other soy milks. I think the strong malt flavor is what turned my child off. I do enjoy chocolate malt drinks, but I don't like the malt flavor in this soy milk either. There is very little vanilla flavor in it that I could detect, and it's much less sweet than a typical vanilla soy milk. This lack of sweetness may be a plus for some people. I tried adding extra sugar and a tiny drop of vanilla to some of this to make it more palatable for my family, but it didn't work. This stuff is going to end up donated to the food bank because no one will drink it here!"
1.0,Mine had bugs and/or were stale! Them they sent more!@!,"Ordered with another chocolate product which was fine.  The Monds looked like they had bugs or were stale, yuck. I am waiting for he replacement box and will update review then, customer service was EXCELLENT as always.  I wish I could order everything through them! Update: They sent me a replacement which had bugs all through it!!!  They haven't even pulled these!!!"
1.0,NOT K cups,"In spite of coming up when searching for K-cups, these are not.  They are some sort of odd filter-pack. They are even boxed exactly like most K-cups."
5.0,Yummy rice chips,These are great.  I am not fond of the plain sea salt chips but these are definitely worth the calories for a treat.  Less fiber than corn chips.
5.0,Constant Complement +++,"This type of tea has gathered constant complements from early times in America and especially in the variant created by Ruth Bigelow in 1945. It is a fine rich black tea with a spice-mix based on orange zest, cinnamon and cloves. Even in its bag form, it seems like a tea follower's favorite personal blend. It is a rare tea that one can drink hot, icy or even lukewarm -- anytime with anything. Like some have remarked, as with most black teas, it is actually good brewed to a standard ratio of one bag per tea cup [five for a quart] -- and can be added to most other black teas -- so one can extend a supply of ""Constant Comment"" upon want or need. It is great hot with milk or cream and sugar or honey. When making iced-tea, it is well to add some lemon or lime and sugar or honey to taste, before adding ice -- as this tea seems just a bit sweet due to its spice-mix. It is good with a bit of rum too. ""Constant Comment"" can hold its own, alone, as well. ""Constant Comment"" looks good, smells good and tastes good +++"
5.0,LOVE this tea!,"I absolutely love this tea. It is definitely one of my favorite non-caffeinated teas. Great flavor, strong enough but not too strong. Great w/out any added sugar or anything. I drink this tea nightly throughout the Fall/Winter months."
1.0,Ghirardelli Chocolate Premium Asst.,Candy was very hard to seperate from the candy wrapper and in some cases the mint squares acctualy bleed thru the wrapper.......don't know if product was still in the (best by date) but provided Ghirardelli with the code number and I am waiting to here back.
5.0,Amazing coconut oil product....,I absolutely love this coconut oil.  Great product.  We use it as a replacement for butter in rolls.  We also use it as a spread on toast.
5.0,my dogs go nuts over these!,"I was originally drawn to these bc I am vegan (my two dogs are not).  But I like the idea of at least having vegan treats for them.  My two freak out over these! One of my dogs is generally very timid, but when he hears the crinkle of this bag he get's so excited and his little eyes light up like he's a kid on christmas.  it's so cute.  A little pricey but worth it.  Also the 'fries' are long.  The first time we were running low I thought to get out the scissors and make 1 treat into two or three.  They are still a decent sized when cut.  I bet you could train your dog to wash dishes with these promise of one of these treats."
1.0,This is NOT Powder-it is Granules,I emailed Swanson after purchasing and they said that by FDA regulations they could label this as powder. It is NOT powder. It is granule's. DO NOT Purchase if you want the powdered form!!! I will never buy Swanson again.. Mislabeled as far as I am concerned. Very disappointed...and charging powder prices too!!
5.0,"Great taffy, but don't buy here","This is delicious taffy with all natural favors, but the price on here is insane. You can get that same bag at trader joes for a dollar ninety nine."
1.0,Does not taste like pumpkin spice!,"My son pegged it - ""It tastes like butternut squash!"" Ewwwww. Not up to the quality of other Torani flavors."
1.0,portion size cut in half,They have added a cheap rice and cut the portion size of the curry in half very disappointing this meal is now a side dish rather than an entree way overpriced
1.0,Nutri Dent dog treats,"I recently have been purchacing the Nylabone product for my pooch ""Rainy 'a 9 year old Peek...his favorite treat for the past 8yrs have been the green dental chews, he begs for them and devours eachone..the last two bags I recieved were not fresh , even the color was off , the entire pkg was hard and had no scent,  usually when i open the bag the smell is evident...not so with the last two purchaces. The other problem is Rainy has no intrest any long in his favorite treat...therefore I will not be buying anymore, or is there any way to correct the situation..sincerely Peter J. Colangelo"
1.0,Chemical Aftertaste! Blech....,"I should have listened to the reviews on these hot chocolate pods, they aren't very good at all. To me, they had a slight chemical aftertaste which was really strange! I'll definitely stick to the other t-discs, every other flavor I've tried so far has been great except this one!"
5.0,Cat loves 'em.,"Noticed my cat dragging leaves in off the porch to chew on and realized she might need a little greenery in her diet. These treats fit the bill, and she loves them. No more leaf chewing, and no rejection of a treat that's actually good for her. Win win!"
5.0,Organic Hard Red Wheat,We have started grinding our own wheat for bread making and other flour uses.  The Red Wheat product grinds up easily and produces an excellent flour base for any food product requiring flour.
5.0,Might just be the best chai EVER,"So I basically always choose Oregon Chai and it was good. Then I found Oregon Chai instant which for some reason was WAY better than the concentrate versions (no sour aftertaste I got from the others). Every chai I've ever tasted after was never as good. So when Amazon was out of stock of my instant (original flavor in the purple box is the best), I decided to try out Big Train (based on reviews). It was the review that stated ""even better than Oregon Chai"" that sealed the deal - I had to try it.  It arrived within the week and I tried it right away. It says you can make it with water or milk but I always prefer water (milk makes to too thick for my liking). It tasted very good, but also completely differently from any other chai I've ever had. So it was actually very hard for me to compare. So after a few mugs, it hit me. It was missing the cardamom/cinnamon flavors that I'm used to in chai. So I added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and OMG, it was AMAZING. Way better than any other chai I've had!  I choose the 12oz three pack (instead of the 1.9 lb 2pack) just to try it out since I didn't want to be stuck with an even larger amount if I didn't end up liking it. But you'll go through these bags fast because it uses 4 tablespoons per 8oz cup! I'm already down to my last bag and it's only been 2 weeks. I haven't tried any of the other flavors (just the spiced chai flavor), but I highly recommend this one!"
5.0,awesome,"this is a seasoning i use in nearly everthing.  it is especially good on steak, salads, pork chops, and veggies on the grill yum! be creative!!!!!"
1.0,The Fruit Flavor Vita Coco,"This tastes awful! ...the fruit flavor. I've had another flavor before, it was okay...not this one. I even tried mixing it in smoothies...no one wants to drink it. It just tastes bad."
1.0,Last time,"Don't buy this product.  They crumble into pieces and do not hold the pills.  I tried to mold the pieces around the pill, and it still crumbles.  Now I use them as treats.  PurLuv HideNTreats were good, but the Sentry brand are useless."
1.0,coffee values,"My bad because I failed to check over the ounces, but the store sells this coffee for less than one half what I paid for it her.  I assumed that it was the large bags and it would have made it fair not great but I won't get caught again  THey advertise 12 ounce  it was only 11 not even pound packages for 8 dollars  WOW"
5.0,Excellent!  Great Choice!,"Great product.  Great taste.  Great choice.  The K-cups make it even better.  So convenient.  Great invention! Will definitly buy this product again, and again."
1.0,Stay Away Unless You Like The Taste Of Bug Spray!!!,I don't know who does the taste testing for this company but none of their flavor coffee tastes anything like what they advertise. This product does not taste anything like a chocolate glaze donut. Taste more like bug spray. Stay away
1.0,poor packaging,"the coffee was all loose inside the box.  Don't know what happened, but unable to use.  Perhaps the box was crushed?"
1.0,Great soup for 23 dollars but not for 41,I purchased this 6 pack of soup for about 23 bucks a few weeks ago and we really enjoy it...good flavor and like all Bear Creek soups it accepts additional ingredients/meats very well.  Came to write my review today and saw that the price is now about $41  for the 6 packs...gimme a break! Will continue to be on the look out for when/if the price drops again....what is going on with these soups and the widely fluctuating prices...a good product but seriously...
5.0,excellent small dog treat,these bones are a perfect treat for my smaller dogs - under 30 lbs each.  They are small enough for my little guys to chew on but last long enough to occupy them for at least half an hour.  They are even good for my bigger dog as a reward that won't disappear in a gulp after clipping his nails.
1.0,Grillin beans,These beans lacked flavor and I added a whole lot of other ingriedients to make taste better. Would not buy them again.
1.0,horrible,"this item molded 7 days after opening (stored in air tight container) I would give it -10 if I could, Tasted very much like cereal nothing like pepperoni"
5.0,My pug loves them but I got a different hartz treat.,"I got a bag with 25 oinkies, pig skin with sweet potato in the middle.  But my dogs like them despite the wrong item being received.  It's still made by hartz.  The description of this product didn't say anything about sweet potato in the center.  So unless they update the description & package image I got the wrong product.  I'm only happy because my doggies are. :P"
5.0,I love this item,Very good quality and drawers slide easily.  The metal is heavy.  Holds a lot of coffee pods. I love the color and the quality.
1.0,Disappointing - more like candy than fruit,"I got turned on to dried mangoes from the ones available at Costco, which are great.  Compared to those, these are disappointing.  Only slight mango flavor, and is overly sugared - has the taste and texture of candy rather than dried fruit."
5.0,Yum!!,"First time trying this...very easy to make and delicious.  Just add ice, water & smoothie mix.  Saves a lot of $ since you are making at home and not paying $4 for each one.  Will buy again!!!"
1.0,not really  very good.,"I love ginger, raw ginger, candied ginger, chinese ginger............. these sachets have an odd taste that I really cannot associate this taste with ginger.  I wouldn't buy this product again."
1.0,NASTY! Tastes like 2 day old burnt coffee.,"This is some really nasty tasting stuff. I just tried this one ""illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Cans"" before trying this one. Of the two, this is definitely the worst. But saying the other one was better isn't really saying much because it was really nasty tasting too.    The closest thing I can compare the flavor of this to is a pot of coffee that was left cooking on a hot plate till there was only a cup left in the pot. Then sat for 2 days. It has a nasty burnt coffee flavor with a strong metallic twang to it like it has boiled for hours in a aluminum sauce pan. It left a bitter burnt after taste stuck in the back of my throat and a foul metallic yuck coating my tongue. And neither one wants to go away. It might supposed to have a espresso flavor and I'm not real sure what that is since I haven't had one in several years. But, if real espresso taste's like this stuff, then espresso certainly wouldn't be as popular as it is. Except as a tar remover or something like that.  On the can it says ""DO NOT SHAKE"" and that made me wonder why? After trying to drink it I'd have to say its probably because it still has a bunch of coffee grounds settled in the bottom of it. And if I shook it up then I would have the chew it instead of drink it. I thought about cutting the top off of the can and see what's in it, but decided that I really didn't want to know. I used to call bad strong coffee battery acid, I think this could actually be used for that.  The only plus I could say about this is,,,mmmm. There's only 6.8 oz. of it to drink!"
5.0,Great stuff!  A nice change from straight tea,"I drink mainly black tea, but there are some green and herbal teas I also enjoy for variety.  Bigelow Orange and Spice herbal tea is one of my favorites--a really zippy treat.  Right from the start, when I do my deep sniff test of the teabag after opening the foil pouch (my favorite moment with tea!), Orange and Spice provides a pleasing combination of citrus and spice aromas.  They are only slightly reduced once the tea is steeped in the cup, so when you're drinking you get the wonderful flavor in your mouth and nose at the same time.  It also has a great aftertaste.  Orange and Spice is a true herbal tea, and does not contain any actual black or green tea.  The ingredients listed on the foil pouch are:  rose hips, spices, hibiscus, orange peel, roasted chicory, and natural orange flavors.  I think the orange peel and spices are the strongest flavors.  I always drink tea straight--no sugar, no honey, no lemon, no milk!  So my reviews are my opinions of the straight tea flavor, not how it interacts with another agent.  I drink Bigelow tea almost exclusively, because it's readily available, modestly priced, and has lots of varieties that are all of decent quality.  If I give a Bigelow flavor less stars, it reflects only my taste preference, and is not a statement of low product quality."
1.0,less than 1 star,"if i could rate this -0, i would.  i have had oodles of sugar free products and have never had anything that was as bad as these little chunks of wax.  I threw the entire bag (minus the 2 pieces i tried to 'like') in the garbage.  My dog wouldn't even eat it and she eats anything! If you truly like chewing on wax, then by all means, buy this product.  If you're looking for something that is sweetened and had a cherry flavor, stay away from this crap!"
5.0,Great!,My grandson loves these.  They are a great snack when he's waiting on his regular food.  Also great for developing fine motor skills:)
5.0,Great treat for cats,My two cats seem to really enjoy this particular kind of treats; both get excited when they see me opening the bag and they also insist upon helping me put the treats on the floor for the enjoyment.  It's at the point where all I need to do is shake the bag throughout the house and they come running.
1.0,dissappionted,"To Whom It May Concern, I just received today (11-29-2011) The Holiday Wreath Gift Basket and I have to tell you I was extremely disappointed at the very least. Whoever set the price for this product should be ashamed. ($24.95 plus shipping)   I understand you're in the business to make a profit but this is a sin. Shame on me this time but I will never purchase a product from you in the future and I will pass the word along to"
1.0,Lipton Soup not what I ordered,"I ordered the Golden Onion Soup Mix that I cannot find in the store. Instead I got a package of 12 Lipton Onion Soup Mix. Total waste of my time and money.  Lipton Recipe Secrets, Golden Onion Recipe, 2-Count 2.6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) "
5.0,Yummy IT WAS GREAT!!,"I bought Buffalo Bills SPICY, ME ad my father love it..I think this has to be the very best JERKY i have had i shared it with my dad..he loves it ordering some more..thanks so much"
5.0,Love this Oatmeal!,This was one of my first subscription orders with Amazon and I'm very glad I put this on automatic delivery.  This Nature's Path organic instant oatmeal is tasty and hearty.  I personally like all the flavors in the variety pack.  Good flavor without being too strong and definitely not bland.  Great way to start the day.
5.0,Decent Value for Great Rice,"I really like Jasmine rice but locally it is usually cost prohibitive OR comes in huge quantities. This is a happy medium and delivered right to my door. It's a welcome change to the rice selections at the grocery store. For those the use rice as a gravy vehicle, this is too good for that, any old rice will do."
5.0,A delightful combination,"I've never been a fan of kiwi & strawberry together, but I think Switch got it right by combining fruit juice with carbonation.  I am a big fan!  It was a little bit too sweet, but I'm hoping other flavors will tone that done a little.  I suspect that the 135 calories for this perfectly sized can is due to the fruit itself, and not added sugar, although there is acerola in it - which is also known as the Puerto Rican Cherry.  That means no added sugar at all.  Try this - I don't think you'll regret it."
5.0,Tastiest snack around,These are by far my favorite snack food.  They also happen to be one of the only Lundberg Rice Chips that are completely vegan.  They have the perfect blend of spices and a great crunch without being too spicy.  The only problem I find is that they are very high in sodium.
5.0,Yummy,"These peanuts were just how I remembered them, great texture and taste, much better than off brands.  Well worth it!!!"
5.0,Great doggie treats!,"I must admit that I don't have dogs that I would consider ""pickY"" but they did really loved these dog treats.  My dogs are small--a mini-pin and a dachsund--and they both immediately jumped on them as soon as they were served...no hesitation that I sometimes see if they get a new food.  Yes, they're really hard and solid, unlike Milkbones, but I like that for my dogs.  I never feed them wet food or soft treats, and like them to have hard foods to clean their teeth.  These are a winner for my boys."
5.0,More time with my old boy,I cannot recommend this highly enough...I think this product has given my old boy a needed boost.....he is a twelve year old Black Lab with the usual hip problems. After a few days he perked up and is moving around MUCH better.....this has been a lot more effective than powdered glucosamine....made a real difference!
1.0,Food Allergies - Beware - Product ingredients listed is not complete,"The only comment I will make is in regards to the ingredients listed.  On Amazon it is not listed that this product contains Citric Acid.  When the product arrived I reviewed the ingredients on the jar and there was Citric Acid on the list. If you are allergic to yeast then you will be avoiding any product that contains Citric Acid.  According to my M.D. yeast is used in the manufacture of Citric Acid.  My M.D. advises those allergic to yeast to avoid Citric Acid. Therefore, sadly, I will not be eating this sauce which I was really looking forward to doing."
5.0,Price Too High,A pack of 12 should be well under $3 each. I bought it locally for $2.79.  The product itself is great. That's why I gave it 5 stars.  Taster's Choice Gourmet Roast Instant Coffee is my favorite instant to use with fat free Coffeemate -- the latter adds just a touch of sweetness. The original Coffeemate tastes lousy by comparison. Fat free is the way to go!
1.0,Well ????,"very disapointed in this product,little taste,certainly no curry at all!! You will be better off & money ahead with regulaer Ketchup. DO no waste your money!!!"
1.0,Horrible taste and smell,"A friend of mine just purchased these for a camping trip. I was curious to see what this product tasted like ahead of time, so we opened one up. Immediately upon opening I was hit with the distinct smell of cat food. How do you make beans and corn smell like cat food?? The beans and corn were mushy and tasted horrible. Maybe its a French thing, but my American palate did not like this one bit. Please do not submit your mouth to such torture."
5.0,"Personal favorite, especially with caramel syrup.",I really like this combo(creamer and caramel syrup)and ordering from Amazon is a reliable way to keep stocked up with both.
5.0,Great baby food,"This is great for your little one, no artificial flavors or additives. But I found out after buying the stage 1, that stage 2 is cheaper & you get more."
5.0,Still plenty of sugar,"My boyfriend is addicted to sugar and in an attempt to reduce it in his diet, I bought this cereal.  He loves it.  You can tell the difference, but just barely."
1.0,Totally Misleading Packaging,"Packaging indicates Almond Blend, you think that you are getting almond flour you are not You are getting a blend of that had 44 grams of carbs per serving verses 6 for a quarter cup! You can not return even if package is unopened. Product should not come up while searching for almond flour."
1.0,"Not the same ""Delfa Rolls"" I remember","I was very excited that 7 years later, they decide to bring ""Delfa Rolls"" or ""Danish Ribbons"" back.  Seeing these reminded me of my childhood, so I bought a case.  It took WAY too long to receive the package.  It came a day after the latest estimation date.  I busted into the box so fast.  Ripped the packaging and dug right in.  As soon at it hit my mouth I knew.  These are NOT the same as they once were.  They taste fine, but they are not the same.  I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of ""Delfa Rolls"" than these are.  I'm very very disappointed!"
5.0,Gret beans!,"These are great refried beans.  Easy and quick and delicious. No canned taste, either. Don't let the fact they are dehydrated put you off.  Until just recently I was able to purchase them at my Raley's grocery store in northern CA but my store has discontinued them (BOO!).  Try these...you'll like them."
5.0,Blueberry Fields Forever,"Celestial Seasonings' True Blueberry is one of the best new tea flavors. Blueberries are good for calming, and this tea is great for that. Celestial Seasoning was founded by a hippie famous for his herbal blends, and there's still psychedelic art. True Blueberry is a delicious caffeine-free elixir!"
1.0,my cats wouldn't eat it...,My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
1.0,Never again!,"I was really excited when I found these. On paper they look great and I really hoped they would taste good too. Unfortunately that is not the case. They look like rice krispy cakes however when you chew them they turn to a powdery gloop in your mouth. I actually had to force myself to swallow it as it was so vile every instinct told me to spit it out. I am forcing myself to choke down the rest of the box because a) they were quite expensive and b) despite the taste they are good for me, however I will never buy these again and with the remaining bars I can only face eating half a bar a day as they make me feel sick if I try and eat a whole one. Sorry but I am sceptical of the positive reviews on here..... they are all written in a similar style and all bar one were posted on the same day.... May 9th seemed to be a very popular day for positive reviews."
1.0,Disappointing,"I've always been a fan of Lipton's caffeinated tea.  However, I was very disappointed by the decaf version.  Something in the decaf process strips the tea of all its character, leaving only the bitterness behind.  The same thing is true for the Twinings Decaffeinated English Breakfast Tea.  Since I only drink iced tea, I can't say how this tea is when prepared hot.  Buy this tea only as a last resort."
1.0,cinnamon,It's basically the cinnamon challenge in liquid form and it smells like a craft store at Christmas. Won't be buying this again.
5.0,Nestle Assorted Miniatures,"Ordered this for my mom's trick or treaters , I am sure they will enjoy it and the parents will have fun their sugared up kids ."
1.0,Poisonous - Chemically Treated BHT...BEWARE!!!!,Are the Diamond Walnuts chemically treated. The recent package that i bought from Stop & Shop has a very strong smell from the shell. On investigation I read few articles stating that Diamond Walnut spray Radio Active and Treat Walnuts with Chemical. These Chemicals are CANCER causing and dangerous for health. The Company can refute these charges with a video showing the  complete process till packaging.
5.0,"Exactly what I wanted, you wont find this at your local mart","First off I thought I ordered 2 bags that equaled out to 1lb but was pleasantly surprised that it was actually 2 1LB bags for a total of 2LBs of surprisingly hot and flavorful cayenne. The stuff in the grocery store is reportedly 30,000 SKU or less and this powder knocks what I have bought in the past, out of the park.  I bought this mainly for cayenne's rich health benefits and am making a tincture with it as well as eating 3tsps a day. Cayenne pepper especially at 90,000 SKU can really help lower your blood pressure, improve circulation, stop profuse bleeding, gives energy, increases metabolism, can stop a heart attack in its tracks, and many other benefits. Google it if you don't believe it, some see it as one of the most beneficial foods to cook with and have in your house. Anyways enough homeopathic babble.....  Bottom line is this stuff has GREAT flavor much better than other store bought kinds I have purchased and really packs the heat! I put half a table spoon in my chicken noodle soup as I have done in the past with store bought brands and boy did I regret it haha if you don't have a heat tolerance and are taking this as a daily supplement I would suggest starting with 1/8 of a tea spoon in 8ozs of warm water and working your way up to 1 tsp 3 times daily for max effects. In comparison to fresh pepper heat I would rather nibble down a habanero or Thai dragon chili both ranking around 100,000 SKU than a table spoon of this stuff like I did in my soup, not to say its bad cayenne but just that a little powder goes a long ways and that's what makes this such a GREAT deal!  If you are looking to spice up dishes, watch out for your health, or use it for any number of other uses then this is the cayenne for you. This stuff is HOTTTT and you will not be disappointed or find a hotter cayenne pepper powder for this price on Amazon!"
5.0,My Baby Likes It,"I like that this is an organic, healthy, all natural baby food in bpa-free packaging. Even more, I like that my selective eater will eat it! The rest of my family doesn't care for it, though. It's easily transported, although I wonder how biodegradable the pouch is. It was delivered February 27, 2012 and has an expiration date of July 13, 2012. The best thing overall about this product for me is that my baby will readily eat it. She's 11 months old and will let me squeeze it into her mouth, which is great for when we are on the go!"
1.0,Beware - made in China ingredients,"I previously bought the 10 piece packs, and the packaging indicated ""Spry is a product of XLEAR INC., Orem, UT, USA"".  On the 600 count package it also says this but also says ""Packaged in the USA/Raw materials from China & USA"".  China is mentioned in much smaller print than ""Packaged in USA"".  It seems they are trying to hide the fact they use ingredients from China."
5.0,Spicy Indomie Noodles,Really like these - much better than the instant noodles available at the local supermarket.
5.0,these are addicting,"I hate sunflower seeds but my son loves them so I got these for him, then tried a few and couldn't stop eating them.  But we had bought them in Wyoming and they don't sell them here so Thank God they were available at Amazon.  The flavor is hauntingly good."
5.0,espressivo yes!,I finally received my shipment of the Espressivo.  I had tried this and went to order it for myself for use with my Citiz machine and I am really pleased all the way around - both the crema and the flavor are excellent. I plan on trying some of the other flavors down the road but really am enjoying the Espressivo. Ethical Coffee Company has a new customer. besides the shipping taking a little longer than expected I think this is great.
1.0,It's No Appletini,"OK, as much as I loved appletini flavor is almost exactly how much I don't love mojito.  Perhaps I just don't like mojitos.  There is just something about mint being in any drink...I just don't like it.  So, if you are a mint fan, you probably would like it.  The flavors are certainly well blended and the mint is very slight.  Glad to have tried it...won't buy it again."
5.0,Healthy breakfast cereal,"I discovered this cereal while in Ireland last summer.  I could not find locally at grocers or health food stores and Amazon had the best deal. The best value is to sign up for regular shipment. Great taste, cold or hot."
1.0,No Thank You,"Ordered these after watching a TV Shopping Channel presentation. Much better price on Amazon. I found the taste to be very disagreeable, and will not be ordering them again!"
1.0,Misleading,"What the web information fails to mention is that the majority of this product is alcohol.  Very little ""pure"" extract in the product."
5.0,love this stuff,"I like using the stevia sweetners because they are a natural product. this liquid is great because it mixes with cold liquids, like iced tea and koolaid. I't so super concentrated the container doesn't take up a ton of space"
1.0,could not eat,"I usually love kashi stuff, but these were inedible.  The taste is just deplorable. I couldn't even finish two bites.  It tastes nothing like chocolate and banana, which I love together. These are just really icky."
5.0,Great!,We have used this sauce for a few years now and it has a perfect combination of taste and a little heat.
1.0,What a waste!!,"I got hit by the same problem many others have...dented cans.  Of the 12 cans in the case, eight were dented.  When you divide the purchase price by the four useable cans that comes to $5.55/can!  RIPPPPP  OFFFFFF!!  As many others pointed out, the box was fine, it was just the cans inside.  I planned to return the offending cans, but in the meantime, I opened one to give some to my dog.  I thought I was buying pumpkin puree but instead I bought orange water.  Now that pumpkin is in stock at my local grocery stores again, I shall return to Libby or Publix brand.  You get 100% pumpkin (be sure you choose pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling).  No water and no dents and most important only $1.49/can instead of $5.55/can.  I couldn't give this product zero stars which is what I wanted to do."
1.0,too sexy for my coffee cup,can not believe how over priced this coffee is there are several other on-line sellers and i located this first in store and at  nearly half the asking price with no shipping charges the product is acceptable but the price is very difficult to swallow would never buy from this seller because of cost not poor product
1.0,Worst coffee I ever tasted,I can't believe how awful this coffee is. It taste like chemicals. I am so disappointed. I also bought the Gloria Jeans and that tastes much better.
1.0,ZOT licorice rope 6 bags,I was looking for black shoe string licorice for decoration on a baking project I was doing. I was disappointed to receive rope licorice instead and that I could not return it for a full refund even though it had not been opened or used. Now I am stuck with 6 pkgs of black rope licorice that I will never use and am out $24.00.  Luckily I was able to find a local source for the shoe string licorice in small quantities and a cheap price.  Never buying food from Amazon again :<
5.0,Yummy gummy bears!,"Great deal for the money, I buy these every Christmas for a friend who is a State Trooper and who loves to snack on them. Love the zip-lock feature."
1.0,These truffles USED to be good,"Okay, we all know that American chocolate (Hershey's, Nestle, etc)is waxy and therefore pretty flavorless. European chocolate is not waxy in general, it melts in your mouth and the flavor is so much better. These truffles used to be European style and they were my absolute favorite, but now, THEY ARE WAXY!!!! What happened? Is it because they are being mass produced? Is it because they think Americans LIKE waxy chocolate?!!! Do not buy these truffles."
1.0,Decent chewy candy...but rancid nuts,"Despite an expiration date in 6 mos, the nuts are rancid.  If you can tolerate that, a tasty product"
1.0,Celtic Sea Salt,"It was OK, but not better than cheeper brands of unproccesed Sea Salt.  I'll save my money and purchase the less expensive brand(s)"
1.0,Find & check dates!,"I purchased Diamond pecans in their shells in December '06 (note, not these, already shelled ones) and discovered AFTER the kids were eating them that they were all rancid.  Be sure and check the dates (if you can, there weren't any on the in-shell nuts) because there's not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying to make with rancid nuts.  I have learned to only purchase pecans from places with dates on the package or where I can smell and taste them!"
1.0,Tastes like Cocoa Pebbles in a bar form.,"I had tried these a long time ago when I purchased them in the store. The ones I purchased online didn't taste the same to me. These taste more like a granola bar form of Cocoa Pebbles. I don't know if they changed the original formula or what, but I did not like the flavor of these at all. They do have a nice crunch to them, but I'd rather of ordered the plain flavor. I did not like the cocoa flavor in these at all. I dislike them to the point I won't eat them and you can't return grocery items, so I'd recommend trying a box at the store before buying in bulk."
1.0,Creamy Garlic Sauce,"Earlier on browsing the same product on Amazon sight, description said it was made with Garlic and Olive Oil, only. Product label on the bottle said Canola Oil and Egg yolk besides other things. Being a vegetarian it was useless for me. It would have been more trouble sending it back than moneys' worth so I gave it away to someone for free."
1.0,Tried to like the costa rican,I really tried to like the Costa rican Tarrazu beans. I tried a couple bags. Sadly the beans seemed old as they have very little coffee taste. This was an Amazon purchase.
1.0,"Maybe good cracker, but package was damaged","This may be a good cracker, but I had to return it, since inside wrap was all ripped and cracker was exposed to air in the box. Maybe I got a lemon, but I was not impressed that it was sent out like that."
1.0,Disgusting,"I have never purchased chestnut puree from a can before.  I typically make it from scratch but thought I would save some time making my Christmas Torte.  It comes out of the can in a thick brown clump that will need to be broken down.  I added some milk and blended it, otherwise it would remain in clumps.  The flavor is ok but not the best.  I followed through with using this product in my torte.  For those that had my torte in the past...did not finish it.  They said that it didnt taste the same.  For all the newbies to my torte, they didnt know what to compare it to so they thought it was good.  I will never use this product and I highly suggest that you do not either."
1.0,We WERE addicted to it! Now it SUCKS!,"This is my original review: My super picky daughters and husband love this, finally a natural supplement! The pediatrician had been telling me to supplement my skinny girls with pedicure, but I refused. We love it!  This is how we feel now: wtf?  I also ordered from vitamin shoppe because amazon was out. I had no idea it was changing, because I wouldn't have bothered ordering a boatload for myself and my friends. Now we are stuck. I can sometimes mix it into a shake for my girls but not my hubby. PLEASE DON'T MAKE US SWITCH TO PEDIASURE! my girls are still very thin and this helped them gain weight heathily ( though they would have originally preferred chips and cookies like every other kid). Please change this back, or make it better. Nobody likes goop.  Consider myself brand loyal, and I don't want to have to start looking for a competing natural weight gain supplement."
1.0,It's Been Awhile Since I've Tasted Something This Vile...,"I am a huge lover of ginger.  I regularly drink ginger tea brewed from fresh ginger root (very inexpensive, yet tasty) and tea brewed from dried ginger.  Both those things are good and enjoyable.  So, when I saw this product I thought it'd be a great chance to enjoy ginger in yet another form.  I imagined it would taste very pleasantly enjoyable...  DID NOT HAPPEN!  This is one of the most disgusting and vile things I've tasted in a long time.  It had an incredibly overpowering bitter flavor to it - so much so that I re-checked the instructions to make sure I had added the correct amount of water (I had).  I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said ""enough of this madness!"".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!  You'd be far happier just making some tea out of fresh or dried ginger root, an option that's cheaper than buying this crap anyways.  Ugh...that taste lingers in one's mouth, too..."
1.0,not good tuna,"this tuna taste Bad, I've eaten tuna 3-4 times a week since I was a little kid, but this one is oily..."
5.0,Flower bouquet,"I hesitated in ordering these. I was wrong these were great. I ordered one for my mother and one for my wife, they both loved them. This bouquet is BETTER than advertised and worth every penny."
1.0,Disappointed,"I used this product just the other day, April 5. My lawn has been taken over by dandilions and clover. I bought 2 gallons of this stuff hoping my problems would be solved. It says it kills the weeds in 24 hours but 24 hours later, the weeds still looked healthy as ever. I'll give it a few more days to see if anything changes. If not, I'll be highly dissapointed. :("
5.0,salad cream,"This product is delicious.  And, it seems, can only be found through Amazon.com. It reminds me of home: England & Belize.  I love it!!  Works great in sandwiches & potato salad."
1.0,eeewww! not so good!,"according to the dietician at our vet's office this food has several elements at too high levels for cats. the most problematic being ash. our cat suffered from uninary tract problems soon after we switched to this and had to spend 2 days in the vet's office at a substantial cost. might be a good product but for our 14 yr old, it was not a good balance of ingredients."
1.0,Miserable Product,"What I normally think of when I see candy rocks is a hard chocolate shell over a chocolate center.  Additionally, the product description includes the phrase ""Products are manufactured in a facility that processes tree nuts/peanuts, dairy wheat and soy products."" What it doesn't say is that the product CONTAINS tree nuts, jelly beans and who knows what else.  And this is a Kosher product! Likewise the manufacturer site does not mention the additional contents of this product.  Add to that, the nuts tasted somewhere between stale and fowl.  I certainly will not purchase another product from Koppers unless I can taste it first.  I called customer service, got a refund and threw the remaining 4.5 pounds in the trash."
5.0,Best popcorn I've ever had at home!,I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!
5.0,Love it......,"Love these pops, got them because i can not find them in stores here any more. They are great tastine if you never had them before i recommend trying one or giving them away for halloween. It is great for the fall as a special treat. Do not eat too much or it will give you a tummy ache. Butr they are great and i hope you enjoy them ."
1.0,Strange Dog Treat,"This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.  My dog kept trying to grab the container, she thought I was trying to tease her with it.  Finally I started rolling it on the dry milk bone type treats that she's not crazy about to get her to eat them.  If they called it ""Dog Bone Icing"" it might sell better  and make more sense."
5.0,Perfect for when you have the flu,I love this spicy ginger drink & find it incredibly soothing when I'm sick so I keep it on hand for just such an occasion (and push it at others when they're not feeling well either!) I like to add a little lemon and honey. The ginger instantly numbs a painful throat and soothes the whole system giving you an immediate feeling a wellness. Love this stuff.
1.0,Artificial taste and smell,This product contains artificial sweeteners.  The smell when it is being cooked or even when it is still dry is overwhelmingly unpleasant and chemical-ish. The artificial sweeteners are VERY obvious in the taste. I bought to keep at work for when I forget a meal but it took me a long time to finish and I wont buy it again because of the chemical smell and taste.  Right now the empty bowl smells strongly of syrupy sweetener and that was after I dumped a tablespoon of peanut butter in it to cover it up.  I like to keep Quaker instants for hurried days but I will not buy this line again.  It just tastes and smells... odd.
5.0,Best Tahini around,"I have tried many tahini types.  Not a single on ecomes close to the quality of this one.  Recieved the order in time.  Only minor complaint - the containers felt a tiny bit oily.  However the tahini is by far the best.  Second purchase Mayh 2012 - same great product, same on time service.  Highly recomend"
5.0,"Perfect cracker for me, especially with brie","Title says it all. I first tried these crackers on a whim years ago when the packaging caught my eye in the local supermarket, and they've been my go-to cracker ever since. The bakers are able to ride that fine line of producing a cracker that almost looks homemade with minimal ingredients, but yet is impeccably consistent - I've never had a bad (broken, burnt, stale, broken seal, too many/few seeds, etc) batch. The flavor is mild, but distinctly sesame. For me, few things are better than this cracker topped with slices of brie cheese. With the packaging opened, the crackers last a couple weeks in the refrigerator.  I feel like a lot of love goes into this product, and I certainly appreciate it."
1.0,Complete Garbage and Chemicals for your animals - Great marketing with pretty pics of vegetables.,"Terrrible ingredients with entire websites dedicated to purina beneful and sick or dead animals.  Animal Digest (enzyme poured on hoofs, hair, teeth and bones to break them down into proteins...mmmnnn healthy) Chemicals Fake Colors Preservatives Bi-products...  Garbage.  = sick animals.  You want to lower your vet bills/keep your animals healthy? It all starts with their food source. Be wise. You are saving zero by purchasing garbage food."
1.0,"Good flavor, very bad texture!","I was looking for alternative healthy protein snack with less fat than slim  jims. Texas BBQ sounded like an awesome flavor---so I bought them. For those of you who have never tried them....pick up a rubber band, baste it in bbq sauce and then eat. That is what this soy protein jerky taste like...a bbq flavored rubber band. The only way I will ever eat these again is if the world no longer has any other protein choice available."
1.0,"GLUTEN FREE OR NOT GLUTEN FREE, THAT IS THE QUESTION.","The box clearly states gluten free, but in the ingredients list, barley malt extract is listed which is a gluten ingredient.  So which one is it?  A dangerous risk for many especially those who have enjoyed Rice Chex and might believe the front cover of the chocolate variety..."
1.0,Turn the volume down!!!,"The toy is so so. I enjoy the buster cube and atomic treat dispenser much better. The hard plastic jar against the tile floors is VERY distracting.  The tug-a-jug kept my dog entertained just as long as the other 2 dispensers. After a while, he just gave up and would lie down next to it.  The noise this thing made was just unbearable."
5.0,I'm in love!,These chocolate bars are perfection! I'm completely off of sugar but I still want to eat chocolate and these bars are above and beyond delicious. I honestly have no need to go back to regular chocolate. Thank you for making these amazing bars.
1.0,A big change,"I discovered DeLallo Imported Garlic, Oil and Hot Pepper Sauce in the early 2000s and loved it, using 2-3 jars/week.  My sons both loved it as well. But about a year to year and a half ago, the flavor changed, drastically and for the the worse.  All three of us noticed it. It began to taste bitter.  You will never convince us that the company did not change the recipe.  Don't know exactly what happened, but it is a shame.  Now we never buy the product."
5.0,Superior chips - wow!,"Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note."
5.0,Love these,"Love these chips...organic, crisp and healthy!  I put these in oatmeal in the morning, as an alternative to chips w/ my sandwich or make up my own snack mix with these, popcorn and nuts."
5.0,A useful amount of tastey organic parsley!,"Parsley is one of the best sources of flavonoids on the planet. It is loaded with apigenin in the form of apin, and it is very difficult to get this much apigenin from any other source. It is roughly 10:1 gram for gram, so that parsley is pouring flavonoids. This ample supply makes it practical to add parsley using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. I recommend up to one cup of parsley daily, which necessitates a large supply, such as provided by this product.  I will admit that I am not an expert regarding parsley as spice, but I love the fresh green parsley flavor that is imparted by this product. It brightens and freshens every food that I have added it to, which is many. When I get a little more money, I will get more so that I can have some in storage. I am sure that it stores well, in a cool dark place.  I may write a parsley guide, so that I can provide recipes to use this much parsley. Apin and apigenin are not absorbed very well by the body, so it probably helpful to use parsley with yogurt, cheese, and acid/oil emulsions in order to improve the absorption. Fatty fish, such as red salmon, is a often neglected source of healthful oils. Citrus and vinegar work equally well for the acid. Be sure and add plenty of fresh ground pepper as well, which is very flavorful, but also likely to aid absorption. Until the time that I am able to write a guide, you can check my blog, which is linked from my profile page.  Regards, proclus"
1.0,What a shame,"VERY expensive,  shipping fees outreageous, tried it to give on Valentine's Day, was embarrassed, slightly stale product, almost tasteless, never again."
5.0,The best!,This is the best tasting chai I've ever experienced. It has great flavor and aroma and it is well worth the price being asked.
1.0,Taste is horrible,"Title says it all.  The flavor says berry, but I'm not tasting that at all.  I see all the 5 star reviews seem to be mixing it with different things, but I just want something I can mix in my bottle of water and drink.  Going back to Controlled Labs Orange Oximega.  It's not the most singularly delicious thing I've ever tasted, but it's drinkable.  This is not."
1.0,HIGH SODIUM/SALT,"TOO MUCH  SALT/SODIUM ;  ALMOST  AS  ""BAD""  AS  ANCHOVIES ; ""KILLER""  AMOUNT OF  ""SALT/SODIUM"" =  VERY DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH ."
1.0,Damaged cans!!!,I just ordered this product for the first time and I was really bummed when I got it yesterday. 7 cans out of 12 were dented pretty good.  Amazon was nice and gave me a full refund. Really sucks the can were damaged i was looking forward to making some organic pumpkin pie.
5.0,Terrific flavor!,"I order Tic Tacs all the time.  I keep them on my desk for those hectic, want to pull your hair out, times. I just wish Tic Tac had an optional lid where you could remove it.  My co-workers hear me getting into my tic tacs and seem to be passing my desk just in time!  Ha!  I have tried all the flavors but the Fruit Adventure is my favorite.  Not too sweet but there is good flavor!"
1.0,Not for small Kongs,"These treats fit the extra-small Kong, not the small one. They won't even stay in the small Kong. Get this only for really small dogs, I'd say 10 lbs or less."
1.0,So sad.,"Mr. Altoids, please let me send you some spearmint. I've got tons of the stuff in my garden and you are clearly running low. Whatever it is you have decided to put in the new spearmint Altoids, it's certainly not much good for eating."
1.0,This is a REFILL KIT!!! do not be fooled!!!,"I ordered this as a Christmas present. When we opened it we found out that you need about $200 worth of equipment to make this. I am an amateur beer maker and thought this would be alot of fun. When you order extra there it says REFILL kit. That is EXACTLY what this is! A REFILL KIT!!! This advertising is extremely deceptive. It also says nothing about all the extra equipment you will need, so here are the thing you will need to buy;  *Primary Fermentor: food grade plastic (30) little capacity. *Carboy 23 liter glass or food grade plastic *Racking tube and siphon hose *hyrometer, thermometer, and test jar *long hadled plastic Spoon *Bottle Brush *Bottle corker *filter and filter pads From A wine retailer  And now you are ready to go!!!"
1.0,clam chowder???,"The product is very bland to start with, and the few tidbits of clams included (believe the most i noticed in any given can was 5 pea size or smaller pieces), just leaves too much to be desired. What a disappointment in this product to say the least, it may be healthy, which I don't really believe, but there is certainly little quality except in the outrageous profit margin! Oh, but plenty of potatoes to fill the space, and they aren't very tasty either! Final thought, if you don't wish to be irritated, avoid this product, unless you like exceptionally overpriced overrated and overvalued items!!"
1.0,Horrible taste,"Don't be fooled by the nice packaging and promises made in the description, you won't get passed the the first pouch. It just tastes like something went horribly wrong at the Eboost factory and they decided to sell it anyway, the taste is a mix of NiQuil, Kool-Aid and alka seltzer.  For the sake of this review, I drank the whole thing just to see if I felt a difference, well, it didn't boost my energy level, the only thing that I came got out of this was an upset stomach.  I was really hoping to like this product, and I still think it's a great idea for people on the go, EBoost just has to really work on the flavor and put a little kick to it, make me feel energetic! Oh and while you're at it, make the pouches easier to open, it took me a while to get this thing open since I didn't have any scissors on had, do a little pre-cut on the pouch, that would help."
1.0,Do not believe the name,This is not what they claim with the name on the package. This is just plain resins not currants. Amazon does not provide the full and truthful description.
1.0,Great taste and HORRID quality control,"Bought several 18 oz bags at Costco.  The taste is superb and no one should buy this product until they fix the quality control problems.  Popcorn is one of the top causes of broken teeth so Angie's may cost you a root canal and crown becasue of the excessive amount of unpopped corn that you may accidentally chomp down on.  The unpops are throughout the bag - not just at the bottom.  The 'sweet' is added to the popped corn before all the unpops are shaken, strained, seived or whatever to get them to fall away to be discarded.  The uppopped are then glued via the sweet sticky to the popped corn.  Even shaking the bag will not dislodge the unpops throughout the bag.  When you get to the bottom of a large bag, there is more than 1/2 of small pieces and unpops (I measured).  Every handful of Angie's that you pick up, you need to transfer to your other hand and remove the stuck on unpops... or throw the bag out... or risk expensive dental work.  This is not a commercially viable product As Is.  Sorry."
1.0,"Hosnestly, the worst tasting K-Cup I've tried to date","I love coffee. In the K-Cup world I'm not brand loyal. I used to frequent Gloria Jean's while growing up in So.Cal and like their icy sweet drinks before Coffee Bean or Starbucks had a comparable offering. Fast forward to today. In my honest opinion, this K-Cup tastes like dirty coffee warmed over. I wasn't expecting a cappuccino. I know what a Cappuccino is. I've been to France & Italy half a dozen times and fully enjoy espresso drinks while dining there. That said, what I was expecting was something that tasked vaguely like espresso perhaps or a full bodied roast. That is not what this delivers."
1.0,no maple flavor at all,I cannot detect any maple flavor at all. If I had wanted cinnamon sugar I could have spent a lot less at the grocery store or mixed it up myself. What a colossal waste of money.
1.0,Low quality,"smelled weird when i opened the container. a little earthy but kinda like they have been sprayed with something. after preparing it the water tasted strange too, not like the usual Pee eS Tee flavor. it kept me from wd's so that was good, but as far as catching a good buzz...eh 1-10 it was about a 3.5"
5.0,Great gift for coffee lovers!,"Pocket Coffee is a tiny little chocolate box with a shot of espresso inside.  The whole family loves them, and I give boxes of them as gifts at Christmas to the coffee lovers on my list.  They're a big hit!"
1.0,Don't buy these online as they don't ship well,This is the second box I received from two different sellers (Amazon was the other one) and both arrived all broken up and stale.  Maybe they are freezing on the way to California but definitely not like the ones I purchased at the store which were fresh & chewy.  These were like plastic wrapped broken brick.
5.0,Aerogrow aerogarden,Seems like a very good product - after 5 days all the herbs are sprouting - instructions are very easy to follow. The Amazon dealer who handled the order was slow and unresponsive
1.0,Stinky,"Tried this and it was not successful at stopping odor at all.  The smell didn't even pause, it bashed us over the head, strangled us and we were left for dead.  Terrible, terrible product.  It was used by one cat, not multiple.  Gag..."
1.0,Do some research before you buy olive oil,"Read the book Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil by Thomas Mueller and educate yourself on the outrageous fraudulent world of olive oil.  When a tin can is labeled ""extra virgin"" and is cheap buyer beware your are most likely getting cheap canola, soybean or hazelnut oil mixed in with inferior olive oil where's the health benefit in that? Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil "
5.0,Twizzlers' Black Licorice Bites Are Delicious!,"Twizzlers' Black Licorice Bites are delicious but difficult to find in the Northeast.  Fortunately, Amazon carries them!  My father loves these licorice bites (or ""nibs"" as they are sometimes called), and he was thrilled to receive them as part of his Father's Day gift.  It comes as an 8-pack, so they should last a little while.  Thanks, Amazon!"
5.0,Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls,"I have been buying Annie Chun's soups for a few years and just found them on Amazon.  I enjoy them very much and now that I can save a few dollars by ordering them from Amazon, I am very happy.  The soups are very tasty and some of them are lower in sodium than many of the other brands.  So, I'm eating something healthy and saving some money.  Great!!"
5.0,One of the best commercial salsas around,The Salsa Ranchera is one of the best commercial salsas around.  I use it all the time when cooking chicken or pork to flavor the dishes and even mix it with cream cheese to make a dip.  It is smokey and rich flavored.
5.0,Gluten-free baking,Excellent for pancakes and baking.  I have tried almost all the recipes on the bag and they all taste great!
1.0,good god why?,"Why has humanity taken a step backwards? This obvious overstatement is a reflection of what I think about this ""new taste"". The dressing has lost everything about it that made it good. I love salads and this is the only dressing I use on them. Its going to be a difficult struggle to find something that will replace the old Catalina; yet it is something that must be done because this stuff is horrible. Kraft, may god have mercy on your soul."
1.0,"horrible flavors, not worth the money","I hated the flavors. The sausage bean tasted nothing like sausage. I thought the grass would have been good but it was ok. The price was incredibly expensive for boxes  not even 6 inches tall. The best thing overall was the shipping. Take my word for it , don't buy this product."
5.0,Excellent starter set.,"What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.  I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.  This is an excellent product."
1.0,Hershey's Cocoa Has Gone Down the Drain,I have even written to Hershey's to ask what happen to the Dutch Processed Cocoa (silver can) and they tried to tell me that the new can was the same thing.  Do they think we are stupid?  The cocoas DO NOT even look or taste the same!!!  What's up with Hershey's? Does it have anything to do with their move to Mexico??  I just don't get it.  Why would a product that so many people LOVE be taken off the shelf??  Something just doesn't add up here.  I've given up on the Hershey's cocoa that my mother used to make her famous fudge for years.  Really hated to see this one go.
5.0,Love it,I love this coffee. I may be just me (I'm n absolute coffee lover) but I find the taste just great. I'd definitely order again. I had an issue with a broken package but I don't think it was the seller's fault and I chose not to go through the hassle of returning it and asking for a new one.
1.0,Warning: LOW SODIUM brand,"The description on this item does not specify that this is the LOW SODIUM Homestyle Chicken Noodle, though the  picture does say so if you look closely.  Sadly, Campbell's appears to have discontinued the regular Homestyle chicken noodle (I cannot find it in any grocery stores, or online) and only offers the healthy request and low sodium options.  The low sodium is AWFUL!!  The flavor is completely flat and almost tasteless, and adding salt does not improve it.  I can understand offering healthier options for parents and others who need to avoid sodium, but I'm ticked off that Campbell's has taken away the regular flavor.  I will say that the price here is reasonable - Campbell's soups are approaching $2 a can in many supermarkets - especially if you subscribe.  I would happily subscribe if this were the regular Homestyle.  As it is, I can't recommend this flavorless soup.  I'd rather make my own."
1.0,Bland!,I just finished a can for the first time and it was so bland that I had to write a review somewhere. No taste whatsoever. I would pass if I were you. Chunky has some pretty good soup but this isn't one of them.
5.0,Yummy!,"I like to keep a bottle in my purse so I can order water in restaurants. We live near the beach, so the water is pretty bad. This stuff is wonderful.  It does say to refrigerate ""for freshness"", but as far as I can tell that just means to keep the flavor strong. Usually after 6 months or so the flavor won't be as strong but I don't mind buying a new bottle a few times a year."
5.0,"Best taste, value and nutrition in a natural vegetable broth.  5 stars!","I'm a 20+ year user of Gayelord Hauser, All Natural Vegetable Broth with good reason.  This stuff contains tons of Potassium which will rejuvenate you and keep you healthy.  God bless the manufactures of this great vegetable broth.  Makes the best soups out there and this is better than hot cocoa in the winter any day."
1.0,Watch Out,Love these gummies but hate the side effects.  Be carefull - don't eat too many at once - they caused the most terrible stomach cramps - a side effect of the sweetener I think.
1.0,Bait and switch!,"Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products."
5.0,If coffee were a tea...,"If coffee were a tea it would be Irish Breakfast Tea. This is a strong and robust tea that is an excellent substitute for coffee. As a matter of fact, I would call it the tea lovers coffee. It's strong and robust and it is best taken in the morning. It will wake you right up! I drank this tea straight for awhile--no sugar, no milk, just tea--but then I discovered that adding a dash of milk or creamer makes it really quite delectable. I especially like adding the creamer/milk with the tea bag and then I pour the boiling water over. That way it mixes itself very nicely. This is a great tea and I will most definitely be purchasing more!"
1.0,Hated it!,I tried this product twice and both times it gave me a headache without any added energy. My advice save your money don't even try this product unless you like headaches .
1.0,Slightly medicinal taste,"I tried this as a cheap alternative for Choffy but I found that these cacao nibs have an unpleasant medicinal taste. I've prepared it straight up and mixed with coffee. My usual method is to grind it in a coffee grinder and then brew it in a French press. After it's brewed I mix it 50/50 with frothy milk that I've made with a Bodum milk frother,  Bodum Chambord Milk Frother . Choffy and coffee is a great combination, the Navitas Cacao and coffee isn't."
5.0,Nice Tart - Sour and sweet addition,I like this because I can add some sour without adding a lemon or lime flavor.  If you can imagine tasting something which has the tart flavor of lime juice without any citrus flavor (to me anyway) this is what you get.  Also has a natural sugar cane kind of sweetness to it.  hint: i sometimes put a dab on my finger and taste it just for fun.. it's a nice candied flavor!
1.0,STOP: PLANT STANOLS/STEROLS MAY BE DEADLY TO YOUR HEALTH,"I began taking Benecol four years ago and I'm now terrified. Stanols/sterols may harden arteries. They may clog heart valves. Yes, they will lower your cholesterol but cholesterol may in fact be the least of your problems. [...]  There are multiple recent studies showing the possibility that this stuff is collecting in your arteries. The fact that this company does not mention this possible danger is disgusting. A few years back they cut in half the amount of stanols in their margarine, possibly aware of the possibility they were damaging millions of hearts. PLEASE HEED THIS WARNING. Unfortunately, I only recently found out about it.  Also, you may notice you're developing xanthelasma around your eyes.  Update: I've just received my blood tests back. I have significantly elevated campesterol levels which could only come from taking this product. This puts me at a much higher risk of heart attack. If you are taking this stuff, demand your money back and stop taking it immediately!  Read this: [...]"
1.0,disappointing,"Scampi in Italian restaurants has a rich butter, garlic, and herb flavor. This product is very weak and watery in comparison. Even the noodles are limp and tasteless. Very disappointing."
1.0,Dried out almost petrified,Product was way beyond dried out tasted like the shelf life past it was kinda white in some cans where the beef dried out so bad
5.0,Honey Heaven,"It was such a pleasure to find sugar-free honey.  Add it to teas, baklava and other Greek treats and enjoy as though you used regular honey.  I do wish they would make some flavor infused honey."
5.0,Love this stuff!,Click tastes great and gives me a mid-morning or afternoon boost.  I now have a coffee house at my desk!
5.0,Just as pictured,I have ordered Bully Sticks from this company twice now in the past 6 months.  Both times the Bully Sticks have been exactly like the picture in their ad.  The shipping was speedy and overall I have been very satisfied with my purchases.
1.0,Defective,Noodles were no longer noodles. Mushy. I've ordered konjac noodles many times. This was a terrible experience And I'm not sure whether it was the packaging or the product which resulted in such
5.0,Best Gummi Rings Ever!!,"Our family buys these gummi rings all the time, and now we have gotten our friends hooked on them, too!  First, the quality is amazing.  We actually took a trip and visited the Albanese Factory where these rings are made.  All of their products and flavors live up to expectations.  Also, the variety of flavors is awesome.  My favorite is the peach, because it reminds me of being on some tropical island.  When I'm craving something sweet I can pop one or two of these and be satisfied rather than go through a whole package of M&Ms.  The value is unbeatable.  I tried pricing these rings or similar kinds at those candy bins at the mall or even at the grocery store.  You get so many and they keep very well in zip-lock bags.  Our family keeps coming back for more!!"
5.0,Great taste,"I decided to try raw honey about a year ago and was a bit overwhelmed with all the choices. I ended up at my local health food store and found Stakich Raw Honey. It is produced about an hour from me, so given the speculation that raw honey from flora in your area helps with allergies, and liking to support local businesses, I decided to give it a try. I LOVE it. The taste is delicious and sweet. I've used it to replace all of our 'regular' honey uses, and no one in my family can tell the difference. The texture is definitely more grainy than processed honey, but that's to be expected. I mix a tablespoon of Stakich Raw Honey and a teaspoon of Stakich Bee Pollen into my Greek yogurt each morning and start my day with a nutritious and delicious breakfast. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
1.0,Disappointed,"I don't like to write a poor review. The seller was prompt in responding. There was some miscommunication in the beginning about mailing address, which was quickly resolved. However, I was told two weeks ago, a new product had been mailed.... it never came, as patiently as I waited and even commuicated with the seller. When I finally received it, today the post mark date was exactly one week ago to today's date, meaning they did not mail it when they said they did. The post mark date was nearly a week after the date they told me they sent a new product.  The plant was ok - I was really disappointed - expecting something somewhat bigger and prettier."
1.0,The worst!,"Do not buy this soup!  I bought their lentil and vegetable at a county fair.  Bad decision!  The ""vegetable"" contains nothing but desiccated potatoes - no other vegetables!  The lentil taste is horrible. The soup is expensive so  money wasted.  I complained to this company and they could care less."
1.0,Don't waste your money,"I picked up a can of these at my local grocery store. I love baked beans and am always looking for new kinds to try. I prefer organic beans and BPA free cans, so these seemed to fit the bill. I happily opened the can and heated them in a pan on the stove. The smell was not appetizing, but I figured I needed to taste them to make up my mind. I took a bite. Oh my, are they terrible! I mean really terrible. I don't know how Eden screwed up baked beans so badly, but they really did. I offered them to my dog, who loves beans, and she took one bite and stopped. Then she looked at me like I was punishing her. Sorry, doggie!"
5.0,Soooooo Good!!,I love Kool-Aid and have since I was a kid but I stopped buying it when I had kids because of all the sugar! I'm sooo glad Kool-Aid came out with sugar free flavors especially since now I'm a diabetic. My kids love it too and we all agree that you can't even tell that it's sugar free. I keep it in the house all the time now since we all drink it.
5.0,good for humid weather,"My 2 cats usually prefer Fresh Step litter (I buy that at Costco), but in our extrememly humid months it gets too clumpy to be tolerated.  After researching various crystals and their prices, I bought these from Amazon. I (and the cats) have been pleased.  I'm careful to scoop 'n' stir daily, and after a couple of weeks the litter seems as fresh as new.  The cats have not been scattering it outside of the box, either--BONUS!"
5.0,all goood,"ALl the braggs apple cider vinegar works good.  I used it and it has given me more enegy, helps my digestive system especially when i feel full.  My mothe rhas acid reflex and takes prescibe medication and still have the problem.  With the vinegar no problmes at all."
5.0,Perfect for a cold fall morning!,These are my favorite flavored K-cups! So happy I was able to buy them in bulk for a great price!
1.0,Jerky,This jerky tasted bland and like it was 10 years old. I tried to eat it but could'nt stomach it. I guess I'll leave it for emergencies. Even the dogs  did'nt want it Darl Shipley
1.0,Locorice is hidden ingredient in Stash Teas,"Locorice even in small amounts raises my blood pressure to dangerous levels. My doctor began to have problems regulating my high blood pressure soon after beginning to drink Stash teas, which (almost all) I discovered contain licorice.  I recommend either that Stash remove licorice from their teas or they carry a warning label for persons with high blood pressure be aware."
5.0,Chickin Dippin,My dogs love these.  I used to be able to purchase locally at Pet Club but they stop carrying them.  I am glad that I can get from Amazon which also makes my dogs happy.
5.0,Unbelievable Product,"This is my first amazon review - I had to write about this product because I cannot believe how great it really is. Initially it was a little odd to take down - it mixes in green to water and has a ""different"" taste, but no aftertaste like many of these products. I took it for a few days and I cannot believe how I FEEL on this. Its not just energy, its just a good feeling that comes over me the entire day after downing this stuff in the morning. I was just sitting at work wondering why I was feeling so good and what I was doing that was different, and then it came to me. They have single serving packs they sell at whole foods. I bought them all. I dont know what it is about the combination of ingredients in this product, but its truly amazing. It doesnt just elevate your energy, it elevates your mood and your very being. Try it and see. You get used to the taste and ive had MUCH more offensive stuff. 5 stars all the way"
5.0,finally found it,Let me begin by saying I had originally bought this from a local store. They had it for about a month or two then they took if off the shelves! Love this stuff! Easy to make and the whole family loves it glad I found it on amazon and for a great price!
1.0,Not what they say.,"I ordered the Hibiscus tea because it is said to be good for high blood pressure. It did not state that there were spices in this tea.  We cannot use it due to allergies to the spices, and there are no returns on this item. Not happy with it.  I did purchase pure hibiscus tea from another company and it is awesome."
5.0,"Mmm...cafe special, the best coffee on the market","Community roasts the best coffe.  Everyone in Louisiana can tell you this.  It's too bad that most people out of the gulf south are not aware of how awesome CC's is.  Smooth, medium to dark body, and full of aroma, but not acidic and burt like that starbucks garbage.  I highly recommend for those who want to have coffee with taste."
5.0,Best coconut oil you can find anywhere!,"Very happy with this coconut oil!  Shipped quickly, pure and pleasant light coconut taste!  Great for adding to yogurt or eating by itself. Price is also right."
1.0,One pack was expired and moldy,"Receive 1 Pack with nasty molds on it. The other one was fine, but I paid for two. So now I'm waiting for Amazon's return label for a refund. If you order some just hope that you aren't unlucky, but I wouldn't recommend it."
1.0,My Earths Best Baby spits it right out...,"My daughter has been eating earths best since she was 10 weeks old, in addition to her formula.  I gave this to her and she spit it back out immediately.  I made several attempts at future lunches and dinners and she refused to eat it.  I even tried to mix it with something else, which always works... except with the ones from Sprout that she hates.  My guess is that the chemicals from the packaging gets into the food..?  Or it just tastes like garbage.  She wasn't picky, until now.  :-)  Good Day."
5.0,My favorite tea,I absolutely love this tea.  It is spicy and delicious.  I recently served it to guests and they couldn't get over how flavorful it is.  Add a little honey and you're all set.  This is my favorite of all the Yogi teas.
5.0,Soft & chewy goodness!!,"I was pleasantly surprised how good this cookie was. To be honeset, I only got to eat 2 bites of it....my 3.5 year old gobbled the rest up!! She's not a big breakfast eater, but she enjoyed this cookie. The raisins were nice and plump, not dried out and hard. Very impressed with the size of it too. This is a great cookie."
1.0,Torn Up in 5 Minutes,"I was thrilled to buy this for my Lab, but within five minutes of letting him play with it he had broken both squeekers, actually torn one out, and after 10 minutes had shredded the poor fox to pieces.  Don't waste your money.  Pick up a 25 cent stuffed animal at a yard sale and take the stuffing out of it.  It will last just as long."
5.0,Delicious!,"I bought this espresso to use in my Bialetti Moka Express.  I love it.  I'm no connoisseur of espresso, I just know that I tried this one and I like it so much that I don't feel the need to try any others."
1.0,Fire Hazard,The bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted.  This product is inferior to other brands I have tried.
1.0,product is good but packaging isn't,we enjoy this product but when i received the 3 boxes one was busted open and i couldn't get my money back
1.0,Didn't help health issues,"I have a uterine fibroid and after ingesting a small amount of this product daily I could feel more discomfort in that area, so stopped drinking it.  Not sure if there are artificial hormones in these animals that are butchered to make this product but it did affect me negatively.  Cannot recommend."
1.0,Horrible stuff,"I am a great lover of licorice.  And I don't know what this stuff is, but it ain't licorice. It has a strong ammonia taste, and reminds me more of droppings in a cat's litter box than any sort of candy. I've been told this is just a 'different' sort of licorice, and it's meant to be slightly salty, instead of sweet. But I'm not confusing ammonia with salt. This definitely has a urine odor, and since I've never tasted cat urine, I can only guess this is what it would taste like. Don't waste your money. This might make you ill."
5.0,Wonderful Plant,"The whole reason for the interest in the fenugreek was for ingredients for cooking curry. However it is an amazing plant. Besides being a great addition to pickling spices and as a salad, the leaves are used to reduce diabetes. The seeds will help mothers produce milk. And if you don't go for herbal remedies, it does make your sweat smell like maple syrup. Hey, better than onions and garlic BO. For more info, I would suggest hitting up Wikipedia.  These seeds were great. Seems like all of them sprouted (I planted alot) and they sprouted fast.  For other interested gardeners, I would suggest looking into stevia, a naturally sweet plant 300 times more than sugar, with no rat poisons (aspartame) or funkified taste (sucralose). Great plant, but buy cuttings and avoid buying seeds. Seeds usually  don't produce viable plants.  Happy Gardening!"
1.0,Don't buy!!,"I ordered these for my daughter thinking they were Tongue Splashers and they were not! I don't mind that they changed the name but this is not like the original! I tried one after my daughter couldn't even bite into them, they were so hard. She finally took a hammer and broke one and said they tasted the same but they were hard to chew. I called and they were ok about sending them back but insisted they were the same product which I know they're not. Don't advertise if it's not the same. Maybe I got an old batch but they assured me they were fresh. Don't buy if you don't want jaw problems!"
5.0,The Microwave Pork Rinds Are Surpisingly Fantastic,"I have not had pork rinds in more than 20 years and thought that this would be fun to try but I didn'nt have high expectations. Microwave popcorn is pervasive and a proven success. However, I had never heard of microwave pork rinds and it was hard to imagine that it could really work as well as popcorn.  Well it does.  I don't have much with which to compare the taste (20+ years ago), however, the texture and crispiness is just as I remembered. I like spicy snacks and as another reviewer noted, these are not especially spicy but I used a few shakes of cayenne pepper and that did the job.  It is very important to shake the bag in order to evenly distrbute the rinds throughout the bag before putting it into the microwave.  I have also found that 2 mins 30 seconds is the best time in my microwave oven to pop all of the bacon rinds.  I have eaten 9 bags of the pork rinds and I love them.  They are light and crunchy and it is my experience that they pop better than popcorn.  And each bag is only 1 carb."
1.0,doesnt work,I will be removing this product from my utility belt as it does absolutely nothing against peaceful demonstrators. Even at point blank range it had little to no effect. It just made a mess.
1.0,TERRIBLE & BITTER A WASTE OF MONEY!!!,THIS SO CALLED COFFEE IS JUST AWFUL!! IT IS BITTER AND DOESN'T EVEN TASTE LIKE THE FLAVORS THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS. AMAZON SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS RETURN AND REFUNDED MY MONEY AS ANY OTHER COMPANY WHO WANTS TO KEEP YOUR BUSINESS WOULD DO. GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE IS A WONDERFUL COMPANY. THEIR CAFE EXPRESS GIVES YOU FREE SHIPPING AND 2 FREE BOXES OF K-CUPS WITH YOUR FIRST ORDER. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING JUST TELL THEM AND KEEP YOUR ITEMS. THEY WILL REFUND YOUR MONEY OR SEND YOU A REPLACEMENT. THEIR COFFEE IS 100% BETTER THAN THIS FAKE FLAVORED COFFEE!!!
5.0,So THANKFUL!,"This has been a huge blessing for our family.  Ever since my son started taking this, he has NOT been sick.  He was suffering from constipation as a baby after we started solid foods.  Once we added this to his diet - NO more constipation!  I'm so happy our Dr. introduced us to this product!  I tell all of my friends that this is a MUST have in your baby/toddlers diet.  I'm so grateful you can get this on Amazon and it's actually cheaper than what our Dr. sells it for."
1.0,not so good,"I was really looking forward to trying this espresso blend and was very disappointed, the beans were very dry, unlike most espresso lenses we h ave purchased before. Usually the beans look oily or wet and have a nice crema on top where this blend did not. We won't purchase this brand again."
5.0,UNIQUE AND ADDICTING,I'm hooked.  I first tried this on my scrambled eggs and now I can't have eggs without it.  Now I always use it with eating chicken too.  Love it!!
1.0,The flavor is terrible,"wish I would of tasted one before i bought this half & half. just to sum it up, it tasted like chemicals. The southern Ice Tea on the other hand is very good."
1.0,"Yes, Virginia, was a very bad rabbit....","When the mailman came, I ran excitedly out to meet him in the yard.  Clad only in my fluffy lavendar slippers and a floral nightcoat...I am sure I was a ghastly sight...but I just couldnt wait one extra moment to finally get my hands on that rabbit!  I was so excited...whole fresh rabbit.  The glory of the purchase was stamped ""fresh"" all over the box in bright red ink, and the entire thing was wrapped in barbed wire.  ""Interesting packaging"", I thought...then thoughtlessly put my ponderings aside and brought my prize into the house.   In truth, I nearly stumbled over the welcome mat as I hurried into the house with my extra special Amazon delivery!  Rabbit!  All mine!  How wonderful!  I hadnt had rabbit in years!   With much ceremony, I sat down with a box cutter and began to open the box. Then suddenly this hairless, headless beast came flying out as if propelled by a spring.  It immediately landed on the table, and held up one of its forelegs. Although it no longer had paws, I got the distinct impression that the rabbit was flipping me off!  The irreverant beast was clear in its defiance.  Startled, I stepped back...I didnt quite know how to handle the situation.  I was quite frozen in shock.  The rabbit deftly kicked the box off the table and approached me with a confident swagger.  It seemed to be sizing me up.   The next thing I knew, the rabbit had seized the box cutter from my trembling hand.  It weilded the blade with obvious expertise, waving it menacingly in front of my face.  I found myself completely immobilized with fear...a wave of morbid awareness drifted over me. There was nowhere to run.  Nowhere at all...   The rabbit quickly stretched its naked, spindly legs and leapt from the table.  Within moments, it began to hurriedly ransack the house.  It spray-painted graffiti chickens all over my livingroom wall.  It broke into my safe and stole jewels and money.  It sold drugs and began extorting money from my neighbor.  It took candy from babies.  It sassed its elders.  I even found it in bed with my husband.   Despite my outrage, and efforts to trap the abhorrent creature, it quickly spread its attentions throughout the neighborhood...then, the city.  It terrorized every man, woman and child...it spared no one.   In desperation, I contacted the vendor for a refund.  ""Oh hell no,"" the customer service man said.  ""You wanted a fresh rabbit...and thats what you got.  No refunds!""   Indeed, the rabbit was ""fresh"" and consequently recieved many outraged face slappings from local women. But I was desperate to be rid of the thing.  I found myself, desperate...alone...with nowhere to turn....  I wept bitter tears at the prospect of my fate and the humiliation I had endured as the rabbit effortlessly dismantled everything I valued in life. My back was against the wall...I had no choice but to fight.  The sound of my boots scraping upon the pavement of the sidewalk was comforting.  I was ready.  My jaw clenched and eyes squinted...I was pure courage.  I was armed.  On my belt I carried the weapons of my forefathers...a bubble pipe, a package of red vines, and a rubber mallet.  I was ready to destroy, or be destroyed...   The rabbit saw me and seemed to sense my determination.  It had no head, but I sensed it sneering at me.  With a warbling screech, the rabbit attacked me. It flew to action, attempting to cripple me with a spinning back kick and a flurry of karate chops.  Gasping, I lashed back with my mallet, blowing my bubble pipe fiercely, and landed a hit soundly on the rabbits side.  Before it could recover, I began lashing it with the red vines, leaving bloody welts on its pale, graying flesh. It squealed in pain and squirmed behind a trash can, with me in hot pursuit...   The rabbit unexpectly turned, and I made a grab at the skinny carcass, but it sped past meIt cursed me and fled. With no head, paws or fur, the animal was very streamlined and as fast as greased lightning.  I doggedly pursued it to the edge of town when I lost sight of it...and I was relieved to see that the rabbit did not seem to be turning back.   It seemed that as quickly as it began...the rabbit's rampage was over.  The last time I saw the beast, I had been patrolling the city.  I saw that it was armed with two automatic rifles and strings of ammunition, and it appeared Rambo-esque upon a hill.  It screamed ""Aaaaaahhhhhyaaaaaa!"" and fired the weapons into the air.  It then ran and jumped into a jeep with Charlie Sheen and sped away...   I saw a mushroom cloud form in the distance...   I looked into the sunset, my teeth gritted with determination.  I would survive.  And as god as my witness, I would never be hungry again!   I sit my weary body behind my computer once again, mopping beads of cool sweat from my forehead. I begin write this review. Gingerly, I start to type....""Yes, Virginia, this was a very bad rabbit...."""
1.0,DANGEROUS!!,DANGEROUS BONES!!! Little dogs love these bones because they are tasty BUT they are truly dangerous. Our family Maltese (Pebbles) who had just turned one choked to death on one. They are not even safe if your supervising your dog because our dog choked on one in the presence of my sister. We were unable to do anything for her as we watched in horror as she slowly stopped breathing and got her to the vet in less than ten minutes. The vet attempted an emergency procedure and removed two peices and the bone had also tore her trachea. Her death was caused by these bones. These bones are not worth your precious pets life as it tore our family apart.
1.0,Total waste!,"I believed the reviews by people saying their destructive dogs could NOT destroy these toys.... BIG mistake.  My 7 month old labradoodle had the plastic in pieces in an hour.  I have to admit, she liked the treat, but totally destroyed the toy in no time at all.  I should have just given my pup the $20 dollar bill - it might have lasted as long....."
1.0,Not Pretzel Salt,"Pretzel salt, like you find on pretzels at a pretzel shop is compressed salt dust.  The grains are large and white and irregular.  This salt is like uniform kosher salt.  Save your money and buy kosher salt... because this not pretzel salt.  Besides the shipping was $10 for a $1.50 item.  I am really angry about the actual price of this (not pretzel) salt."
5.0,Excellent tea!,I have been a fan of this tea for years.  Have shared it with flight attendants.  It's dessert in a cup with zero calories!
5.0,Love it!,"Absolutely love this product.  It is great for that dark, rainy afternoon when you just want to relax with a good book.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Much better than garlic powder!,"I used to buy this product at the local WalMart, but they no longer carry it.  It delivers more garlic flavor per ounce than ordinary garlic powder, and I use it whenever fresh garlic is not practical...on my burgers, in potato salad, etc."
1.0,Be Careful When You Buy In Bulk - Non Returnable,"I do not believe that this is the same gum from years ago.  It has a terribly sweet synthetic overpowering smell.  I discovered that I am allergic to one or more of it's ingredients.  The flavor lasts about 60 seconds and then it's like chewing a big wad of rubber.  Since this is non-returnable, it is going in the trash.  I gave the gum one star because at least it is still made here in the U.S.A."
5.0,GOOD QUALITY,Fast delivery. The candy looks pretty and NEW!! Taste good for sure. I am glad to choose their candy as my WEDDING CANDY. Nice seller reply quickly!!! Happy experience to buy candy from CandyMafia!!
5.0,Best food for small breed puppies!,We have a 14 week old silver dapple miniature dachshund (Sophie) that couldn't hold down any food. She was getting the runs and just plan out sickly. We picked up a bag of Fromm Puppy Gold and started feeding it at 100%. The next day she had the first firm stool we had ever seen! Sophie has now been on the food for about a month and we never plan on feeding her anything other than Fromm. It's a great food!!!!
5.0,wonderful effects,"This tea might not taste delicious but has an ok flavor, the effects it has on my body are wonderful; it helps with acid reflux and it works wonders when i feel nauseated."
5.0,Yummy!,I love the way this cooks up! Tasty and way better than the blue box!!
5.0,Great Hot Sauce,"This stuff is the BEST if you love spicy and hot things as much as I do, then this is the stuff for you. I am making more and more meals with this sauce. However, I will warn anyone who is going to buy this because I was putting about 5-8 drops on everything I was eating for about 3 days and for the next week my stomach was in pain. With the amount of sauce I put in my food my eyes would water with every bite, my face was bright red, and I was sweating. So if you want to experience some great and insane hot sauce the I would recommend this. My next purchase of Dave's Insanity Sauce will be the Ghost Pepper sauce."
1.0,Half-Opened and Eaten,"When I first got the package, I was excited to finally try this candy I'd heard about from my friends in the UK.  However, upon opening the package, I realized that the Wine Gums' package was previously opened and that there was only half of the package left.  It was a total rip off.  Obviously I didn't eat it.  A complete waste of money."
5.0,Great Salsa,"Mrs. Wages is the best salsa mix around. It's great to be able to freeze it and not worry about canning and pantry space. Great product for reasonable cost! Also available in regular, medium, and hot varieties."
5.0,My favorite!,Of all the different types of Chai that I have tried this is by far my very favorite.  I have been ordering it for years and will continue to do so.
5.0,A flavor for all occasions,"Although expensive, I like the idea of being able to try products from different companies.  In the future I will order only those I liked from this variety pack."
5.0,Great Sweet Cereal,This is a great cereal for those looking for something beyond Sugar Crisp.  Even has some fiber in it
5.0,Love the cinnamon,"This is my favorite muffin mix, and great for Sunday mornings -  and for company. You can substitute a small single serving applesauce for the oil and use half water and whole milk with great results."
1.0,soap water,"have been buying this product for three years.  the 1 liter product by same brand tastes awesome (5 stars), but this smaller size product is terrible. surely, there's something wrong/amiss with this manufacturer - how can the same two products taste so different?  sadly, the big size is out of stock and not to be found anywhere (tried amazon and all whole foods, etc.) - whole foods says the product is not avail for last 3 months.  am writing this negative review hoping the company reads it and kindly brings back the big size product with the same original taste - will change the review if they do that. thanks!"
1.0,dont buy!!!,This does not fit the Davinci chocolate syrup bottle as they claim. It doesnt screw on all the way. completely useless! I contacted the seller but have received no response.
1.0,Update on review...,This is still good coffee but they have DOUBLED the cost.  Half the price at BBB with a 20 percent coupon.  Also available half what Amazon is now charging @ Target & Walmart (at least it was available there a couple month ago)
5.0,I love the taste plus it's good for you!,I moved to a town where I could not get this stuff in the stores. When I saw I could get this by the case at a good price I got it. It tastes so much better than plain oatmeal and is easy to cook. I just add a little water and microwave for 3 minutes and yummy! Get this with the subscription for free shipping and a better price...
5.0,Very Good-Crunchy,"These are very good bars. They aren't too sweet and are very filling. Just enough chocolate!  I do just want to say that these are not chewy bars, they are crunchy and quite hard. I have definitely stabbed the roof of my mouth multiple times while eating these. The taste makes it worth it, but just be forewarned. If your teeth aren't strong, don't bother."
1.0,great chips but terrible shipping,The chips are awesome.  I first bought them at Costco and now I cannot get them there any more.  The bags at Costco were about 3 times larger than the one I recieved from Amazon.  The arrived mostly in tiny crumbles of chips and the bags were about 1/3 full.  I won't waste my money buying them from Amazon again as the shipping is just not up to par.  If you can find the chips retail I would advise buying them that way.  Their website says that super target and Costco carries them but have not been able to find them there recently.
1.0,Missing,My item is missing from my package it's needed before Aug 21st please send it !! and I have paid for it!! Thanks
5.0,Yummy!,Superb taste.  Love the Organic nature of it & no chemicals & unnatural ingredients as most protein drinks.  A good amount of protein especially considering the size of the container.  Love it!
5.0,Bamboo,"Bamboo looks just like the picture, and 6 months later it is still growing strong and very green!  Awesome!"
5.0,"Smotth and never bitter, even when made extra strong","Yuban makes the best cup of coffee. Either roast is never bitter, and makes a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee extra-strong, and we have been using Yuban for years. The coffee is very consistent and distinctive.  This is the best canned ground coffee out there, period. We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half-n-half, and you have bliss in a cup.  Don't spend your money on the expensive ""designer"" coffees. This is the best!  If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban!"
5.0,Head and shoulders above the rest!,"These are excellent treats that I would recommend to almost any dog owner. After purchasing  Bil-Jac Little Jacs Liver Treats  while in a rush at the store, and then reading the ingredients list, I knew that I didn't want to purchase anything with additives and low-grade chicken any more! My wife and I picked these up at a pet store and so far we have been quite pleased!  PROS - Contains NO chicken by-products* - Contains no wheat** - Perfect size for puppies, small dogs or training - Also available at pet stores  CONS - A tad pricey - Give some dogs loose stools  *While this product doesn't contain chicken by-products, don't be fooled into thinking that it contains high-grade chicken. This is definitely better than most dog treats, but it's not on par with  Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats  or  Flint River Ranch Dog Treats , that use human-grade meat and poultry.  **Some dogs are allergic to wheat. If your dog has allergies or even is beginning to show symptoms, wheat should be the first thing you cut out. Many MANY foods contain it as a filler, and many allergies are traced back to it.  OVERALL These are a little pricey, but you are paying for a healthy, nutritious treat, not some WalMart-grade by-product infused junk. If you care about your dog, you need to feed them with the best food and treats available, and these Chicken Bits are a great place to start!"
1.0,Diappointed ! !,"I was very diappointed in this product and the company selling this product! First of all shipping of this product was grossly overstated and was not anywhere near its estimated delivery time(product was 3-4 days overdue). Second of all this product was advertised as(HOT & SPICEY)an this is an overstated claim , You can purchase Hotter & Spiceier chips locally that has more KICK than these!  I(WOULD NOT) recommend this product or its (shipper) to Anyone!"
5.0,best orangettes and great prices,"even it is abit expensive to buy sometimes, but I find that the quality is exceptional, great taste, great packaging, and still cheaper than some other brands with a better taste. The texture and taste are just right! The shipping comes in 2 days, great wrap and bow like its for a present, comes in a foam box. I never had any shipping problems at all."
1.0,Stale,The entire box of treats was so hard I had to hit them with a hammer to break them small enough for my 60 lb dog to eat.
5.0,won't buy anything else,"I was told by a trainer if I continue to feed my German Shepherd this food, barring genetics or accidents, he could live to be 18.  That's gold to me.  All my dogs eat this and they love it.  The grocery stores are starting to stock premium food, but it costs more by the pound than this does.  So I keep it coming via Amazon, much to the distress of the Fedex and UPS men.  There are times when I run out before I realize it and have to grab a bag of another premium brand at the grocery store.  If the store brand is in one dish and the Chicken Soup is in the other, they ignore the store brand."
5.0,SLICED ALMONDS Good Quality and Price,"I use lots of nuts in salads and cooking, so this bulk product is the way to go.  The packaging has a nicely functional ziplock function, so i didn't have to remove the nuts to a jar or other place of storage. Recommend!"
5.0,Love this oil,I pop corn at least once a week and this oil is the best. I have always used peanut oil and it works great but i like the way this oil makes the corn yellow. It is not a liquid.
5.0,A Truly Great Cup of Coffee,"Unlike many others, I haven't paid much attention to the price of K-cups because I've been on Amazon's Subscribe & Save for K-cups for over a year now. Wanting to try another brew for a change prompted me to try these. I'd used this brand before in whole beans because they were at Costco so I knew I would like. Wow! These are very different from regular K-cups. Like another reviewer said, the aroma wafts like real brewed coffee and the flavor is rich and bold. I am so happy I took the chance on this. Subscribe and Save is the way to go!!!!!!!"
5.0,Spelt Flour,I have found this Spelt flour to be excellent.  The price is reasonable compared to my local specialty grocer and the delivery is immediate.  Very happy with product
1.0,Awful...Yuck...,I bought this reading good reviews about the flaxies but oh.yuck...it leaves an awful taste in mouth... don't waste your money!!!!!!
1.0,YUCK,VERY sweet. I bought 2 boxes and threw them away.  I could not finish one cup.
5.0,Thai Pavilion Pad Thai,"300 Calories per container 45 Calories from fat Total Fat 5g (Saturated Fat 0.5g, Trans Fat 0g) Cholesterol 0 mg Sodium 810 mg Total Carbohydrate 57g (Dietary Fiber 0g, Sugars 10g) Protein 5g  The taste is surprisingly good. There is a medium spiciness to the flavor. Packs well in my purse for the commute. I use hot water from the coffee machine at work and it cooks up nicely in 5 minutes."
5.0,Really works,"Moles and/or Voles were turning my garden into swiss cheese.  After putzing around for 2 years, I put this stuff down twice about 7 days between apps, right before some forecasted rain showers...this really works.  I have to admit, I put it down about 2x per the instructions, and then followed up with a liquid concentrate from another company, covering the gardens and lawn.  I would definitely use this again!"
5.0,Only food my poodle will eat!,"This food was recommended to us because our dog wouldn't eat.  It is a little bit expensive, but following the suggested amount on the bag it lasts forever.  She loves it and is doing great!"
1.0,Not Very Durable,"Sorry, folks, but my pit bull mix destroyed this toy in less than two hours. He even ripped off the top and chipped the indestructible plastic... if you have a ""busy"" dog, this is probably not for you."
5.0,"A great ""outdoor"" cookie","These cookies are great on a hike, camping trip, etc.  Full of fiber, not too sweet and very filling.  The chocolate chips are delicious.  Tho' the cookies are soft, the oats give enough body to stand up to dunking in coffee, etc.  I found the manufacturers website by accident and tried their sample pack of 4.  Two packs each of the original and two of the raisin.  Like 'em both equally, but ordered the 12 pack in the original from Amazon.  They arrived tightly packed, none were broken."
5.0,Another Kikkoman Winner,"Kikkoman's Sushi and Sashimi soy sauce is a slightly lighter, slightly sweeter variant on their great basic product.  It is excellent for dipping sushi when plain soy sauce might flavor the rice too strongly.  With sashimi, it's slightly sweet texture nicely compliments delicate fish, and is a superb counterpoint to wasabi.  All in all, I highly recommend this product."
1.0,Tastes bad,"Simply put, this just doesn't taste good.  I'm surprised it got ratings this high, because it really doesn't deserve them.  Edit: I should have figured; it's gluten free.  So the people reviewing this are probably used to eating bad-tasting things."
5.0,Just like always,"great, taste like always and is as good as ever.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice, wonderful, awesome. Fantastic, fun, wow!   Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?   How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it."
5.0,Better Than Milk,I like to use this in place of nonfat dry milk powder to make GFCF bread. It works great and adds a nice taste.
1.0,not satisfied,I really did not see that this product hepled me in increasing my milk supply. Not only did it not help me but it has a bitter taste.
1.0,Really Awful,"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
1.0,No Cheese Flavor,I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised.  There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product.  Even the salt flavor is off.  Avoid this product.
1.0,Misrepresented. NOT 100% Juice.  NOT 32 OZ.,"I will keep this review short and to the point. This is not 100% Juice. It is Acai puree, water, evaporated cane sugar, citric acid, xanthan gum; as listed in their ingredients section. It comes in a 32 OZ bottle. It contains about 26 ounces of fluid, as recorded by me using US standard ounce measurements. Although I think it tastes OK, I am very disappointed at the misrepresentations and will not buy it again."
1.0,ordered the wrong chews,"I ordered the wrong chew. I meant to get one that had the ""HEXTRA"" coating (I think that's how you spell it) but got plain chews instead. However, it was disappointing that this product was a Canadian one. I think that it should have been clear on the website, Canadian import. Maybe it's there and I just didn't notice. I ended up sending it back. I will say that the store I bought it from (Entirely Pets) was very prompt in shipping it out, but not as prompt with the refund process. I had to call twice to find out what was going on. I had gotten a return authorization number prior to shipping it back, so I'm not sure what held up the process."
5.0,LOVE THIS RUM CAKE,"We love this cake for a holiday dessert or simply as a special treat.  It can be served plain or with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  It's not a chocolate cake as thought by previous reviewers.  It's dense, rich, and loaded with rum...YUM."
5.0,Best chocolate wafer in the world!,"Kinder really makes the best chocolate in the world. The word ""kinder"" is ""child"" in Germany, and this is a German company. Too bad they don't sell it in the Untied States. This specific one has hazelnut cream, milk chocolate, and waffle in it, and is crispy on the outside. It is very inexpensive, too. If you have never tried it and you like candy of any sort, you will love this one!"
1.0,Very weak,"I feel like I got a box of plain wood. You can almost tell there is supposed to be some cinnamon in these, but not really.  Maybe I got an old box but these were very disappointing."
1.0,Taste like old people...,"I never imagined I would ever know what old people taste like...yeah, I was wrong... My advice, just walk away from this one."
1.0,SO disappointed!,"I don't know WHAT they did to their recipe but these are HORRIBLE! I crave these things often but last time I got them, I was even scared of their look! I got past it enough to try them and sure enough, they aren't AT ALL what they used to be. I miss the good old days again. :("
5.0,"Stevia, natures sweenter.","This is a great company that is looking out for our health. Stevia is more then a sweetener; It helps reduce sugar cravings and even acne. (I challenge you to look it up). This company emailed me right back when I asked about it being Organic. They said yes and were working on getting it on the label. They are coming out with more products to benefit our health.  I was not a fan of Stevia at first because it is a different taste,so I tried Chocolate first (Yum, not real chocolaty). This is also a great creamy flavor. I have been told the liquids are better then the Powder."
5.0,Scrappykat,"Really glad I purchased the sample pack for a chance to try the different flavors. Loved the unsweetened black tea! If you like a good strong cup of tea in the mornings like I do, this is the best one I have tried for K-cups. Still had good strong flavor even with cream added."
1.0,typical agribusiness taste,"Has an agribusiness flavor - not exactly stale, but not really fresh. A bit on the greasy side, even though not ""buttered"" per se.  However, does pop well. Almost all kernels pop without the risk of burning."
1.0,Want some Cardboard? YUCK!,"I bought these in hopes that my kids would like to eat them on their way out the door.  So dissapointing!  These are so gross!  I can barely even tolerate them.  We eat so healthy so it is not that we aren't used to healthy good food.  WE always eat whole wheat and we are always eating fruits and Vegi's.  You all can't say that it is because we aren't used to healthy eating.  Now, back to the cookies...they just are gross. I don't know what else to say, they are dry and tasteless discs comparable to cardboard.  So very bummed out that they aren't what we were hoping for.  Back to granola bars I guess.  :( O and just cause it says cookies does not mean it is good."
1.0,Tastes more like cornbread than vanilla cake!,"I actually bought this at Wal-Mart, for about $2.50. I wanted to try it because at only 140 cals per serving (for the mix only, as packaged) it comes in at 20 cals less than Pillsbury, plus hello, it's organic. I made it as cupcakes and they sank in, in the middle. Also, the consistency is way more like a corn muffin than vanilla cake. Kind of grainy, and actually the taste is quite reminiscent of cornbread too. Pretty gross!"
1.0,Horrible taste,"This product tastes horrible.  I was looking for a soy free protein and came upon this item.  I mixed it with soymilk and it tasted like pea-flavored chalk.  I thought I might have used too much powder so I tried half the amount of powder and it still tasted the same.  Not wanting to give up, I mixed in a scoop of strawberry flavored whey protein and it truly tasted like a combination of strawberry and chalk.  My fiancee then tried it and couldn't take more than a sip.  In the end, I was able to down three cups of it, but I don't think I can drink any more in the future. I am going to take them up on their money back product guarantee."
5.0,Fabulous flavor and texture,"I am a passionate home cook and have been canning my own tomatoes since I was a child.  American canned tomatoes all contain a ""firming agent"" that prevents the tomatoes from turning to mush in the can.  This agent also prevents them from breaking down nicely in a sauce, too!  Thus, I always can my own.  However, I will no longer be using my own tomatoes in pasta sauces after trying these Italian tomatoes.  These tomatoes are rich, meaty and are packed in a thick sauce.  They look and taste fabulous, and make an amazing pasta sauce!  My husband and I kept ""mmm-ing"" as we ate the first sauce I made with these.  I love the fact that they have no additives of any kind - no firming agents, no herbs/spices, not even any salt.  You have complete control over how you season your dishes.  I'm soooo glad I bought a whole case of these, and hope I will always be able to access them.  The case price brings them down to well below supermarket prices for Italian tomatoes.  I couldn't care less that they are not DOP San Marzanos, just like I couldn't care less that my champagne doesn't come from France!  These tomatoes are the same as San Marzanos, without the special government label of tomatoes that come from a small geographic area in Italy.  American or home canned tomatoes are great for soups and stews, but no more American tomatoes for my pasta sauces!  I encourage everyone to give them a try."
1.0,These sucked!!!,I absolutely LOVE peppermint altoids but the ones I order from amazon left a stale dusty taste in my mouth. They were no where near as fresh as those purchased at my local market
5.0,GF Bisquick never disappoints,"I made delicious banana pancakes last week using this product and over the weekend, remade a family favorite from years ago, Chicken and Dumplings, which was on the Betty Crocker Website under GF.  We couldn't tell the difference between the GF and regular mix in the dumpling results.  I made the recipe from scratch for six, using chicken breasts and thighs simmered till tender in chicken broth, baby carrots, celery, cut green beans, onion and seasonings and stirred up some white gravy to pour over the dish before serving.  Husbie loved it."
5.0,Yum! Yum!,"These cherries are great mixed with dried blueberries, almonds, and walnuts and kept in the refrigerator for a quick snack.  Be aware however, the sugar content is quite high.  Very chewy and tasty."
5.0,Yuuuh-uumm!,"I am Diabetic and also food allergic (no lactose, gluten, soy or grapes), and these candies hit the spot.  They are yummy!  They taste just like a slightly sweet green apple and serve as a wonderful after-dinner sweet.  It takes 4 of them to make the 16 gm Diaabetic low-sugar rescue amt, so it is easy to carry them in a pocket, etc.  Buy these!  They are wonderful!  I use Subscribe and Save and love it!   GoNaturally Organic Apple Gluten Free Hard Candies, 3.5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) "
5.0,morocco in a tube,harissa lovers will love this wonderful easy to use and store tube of morocco's pepper paste.
1.0,Don't buy these bottles,"I bought these bottles because I liked that they were BPA free and they looked comfortable.  They are awful.  There's a lip inside the bottle that's a pain and makes it feel cheap.  And the real reason I hate this bottle, all 3 broke.  My son would drop it and it shattered each and every time.  Today I lost the last bottle and I'm going to be calling Evenflo tomorrow to complain.  Now don't take this as a slam against evenflo.  I have the glass bottles and the very cheap BPA free bottles and those are all great.  But the comfit really aren't built to last even though they cost the most."
5.0,"pricey, but worth it","My dogs and foster dogs LOVE these treats. They're soft, and easily break into smaller bits if you wanted to use them for training.  The dogs come running for these little snacks, and they are a novel protein source, with no grains, so great for pups with allergies."
5.0,How to really ENJOY your hempseed protein powder,"Searching for healthy foods that will most benefit me and my family, I have found this hemp protein powder is a terrific boost for the body. I was having trouble finding ways to incorporate it into our meals, I am not a big smoothie drinker and I found the powder a bit difficult to bake with. THEN, I had a brainwave: put it into dips! I use cream cheese, kippered herring or other smoked fish, paprika, onion, celery seed, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, makes a truly flavorful dip, and you can put as much protein powder as you like in it, you will hardly notice it. Any spicy or well-seasoned side dish or dip is easy to enhance nutritionally with this natural, protein-rich powder. And for times when I can't eat  I put it into capsules for easy consumption. My sister is a diabetic and finds taking the capsules help her keep to her diet of several small meals every day. My husband will happily consume a hemp-boosted dip on his favorite corn chips, or take the capsules if he needs a mid-day power-up. Older family members who may be poor eaters can be sustained with the addition of protein powder to their diet as well, to improve their well-being and to help maintain cognitive function. When hot weather strikes (and it strikes hard, here in Texas) I find it difficult to eat much, but I can take some protein capsules and come on strong again."
5.0,Great Tea,This tea is great. My husband doesn't like tea but he loves this like me.
1.0,I don't understand,I'm wondering if the positive reviews are by employees of these companies. I've heard that goes on. WHy would one customer say it's just like coffee house chai and other say it's not even tea. The reality is it isn't very Chai'ish. Weak and not very flavorfull. I think its impossible to extract true chai flavor without a very well made extract concentrate in each pod. I haven't found that in this or any of the other chai cups. Very dissapointed. Wish I could get my money back because I'm throwing them out. I'm a S-bucks Chai addict and no way does this even remotely come close. I'll stick to dumpong concentrate into breakfast tea.
1.0,Awful,"These where just plain awful.  White-ish color and crusty.  They had a very bland taste and what taste they had was bad, not sweet or sour just awful.  I gave 1 star only because you can't give ZERO stars."
1.0,Flavor Not Guaranteed.....,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the whole point of buying candy like this to get the flavor you want?  To price it at a premium and sell whatever flavor they happen to have lying around is unethical--disclaimer or no.  Candy mafia indeed."
5.0,"Tasty and Cheap, for a K-cup","Newmans own is the best coffee around for the price.  My keurig is breaking me because the cups are so expensive, newmans is as good as any coffee out there and the price is better than the rest."
1.0,nope,"I really really wanted these to work for my adopted 8lb pom - adorable 11 yr senior.  Didn't even last for 2 city blocks. The toe area started to shred - and no, he doesn't have long nails at all. I need shoes to protect his nails - he tends to drag his front paw and vet recommended boots.  So if anyone out there has a suggestion, would greatly appreciate it!"
5.0,Excellent food!,"This is one of the few chicken cat foods that don't contain some kind of fish and my cat loves it.  One of my 3 has allergies to fish so I have had somewhat of a challenge finding food without any type of fish protein.  She can also have lamb, which does help as far as alternating and giving her variety.  This one is just wonderful in that it doesn't contain any synthetic vitamins.  A great approach and well received in my home.  One of my other cats has a longer allergy list and is currently on rabbit, which is even harder to find.  She is on the top 3 brands that offer rabbit, including this one.  She loves it, so I thought I would try the chicken flavor for my little fish-less one and it turned out to be a rewarding venture.  I find the price competitive with this type of food and will keep it in their rotations.  It is drier than other brands, but I just cut it up and add about a tablespoon of water on top.  They lick it off like gravy.  Good deal."
1.0,Product not as advertised,"The quality is not good. Thin and NOT odor free. Like the other reviewer posted, count your package. I did not get 30 of the product, only 25. Same for an earlier order, not 30 of the product, only 23. Recommend external websites for better quality and price of product. Not to mention a true count."
1.0,Never again,"I was impressed with the list of all organic raw ingredients of these bars, but the taste is bad. I won't buy it again."
5.0,overpriced,way overpriced Jewel has this for $2.79 same bag size. and look at the overpriced shipping cost.
1.0,Gross,I bought a few bags of these noodles because I wanted noodles that were low-carb. It sounded too good to be true. It turned out that it was too good to be true. I rinsed these noodles and couldn't get the foul smelling odor off of them. You can add sauce but it just masks the nastiness of this product. I dumped the rest of these bags of noodles in the trash.
5.0,Yummy,"Converted oatmeal cranberry white chocolate chip cookies recipe to vegan and used these chips.  The cookies were excellent, and the college kids gobbled them up.  These white chocolate chips are delicious, and I prefer them over all of the others I have tried.  Highly recommend."
5.0,Very good for school snacks,"I started buying this item at the begining of the school year for snacks.  My kids take them to school and like them so much that they now eat them all the time.  At first they did not even want to try them, but now I can not keep them in the house.  They always come fast and fresh."
1.0,product ordered not product received,"I ordered the pictured product of York Peppermint Patties that showed the candy wrapped individually, in the round.  The TWO packages I ordered came packaged with the mints wrapped in the new individual envelope packaging.  I spent MUCH MORE than I had wanted and then didn't get the product I ordered."
1.0,Lame...,Mine arrived in a giant crusted mass and all the spices were very old and black. Tasted way too salty and herbs were basically rancid... stay away
5.0,Yummy!,This makes a great lunch for taking to the office.  Just water and microwave and it's actually pretty tasty.
5.0,It really works....,"I'm not a huge fan of herbal tea, but the taste of this tea is OK, and it is a great value and easy to brew.  What I really love about it, however, is that after drinking it for a couple of weeks, it has noticeably reduced my blood pressure.  I try to drink two cups a day, and am hoping it will bring my numbers down even more with a little bit of time.  Very happy to have found this natural remedy!"
5.0,Excellent!,"Whoever thought of inventing these things? Whoever did, these are great snacks. Very cheesy. However, like all these types of snacks, you can't eat a lot of it. Basically, you just need to make sure you can control your urge to eat a lot of these things. 2oz is the most you should be eating, but mmmmm, they are good!"
5.0,Pet Supplies,Nice way to save time and money.  I usually pay twice as much for this product in pet supply stores.
5.0,The best blue box,This is the best powdered cheese macaroni I've found. I always add 1 tbsp of unsalted butter to it. I used to buy it at WalMart but they stopped carrying it and it's $3/box at my local grocery store so this is a pretty good deal on Amazon.
5.0,Delicious Cereal,"This is a favorite in our house. There are many different variations of this cereal, but the Maple Pecan Crunch is our favorite. It is a little high in sugar (10mg per 3/4 cup), but that is to be expected with ""Maple"" in it. There are 5g of fiber per 3/4 cup, so that is great."
5.0,Nutiva HempSeed is very very good...,"I heard my friend who is a fan of Rocky Mountain say that Nutiva had too many shell pieces in it.  But I tried it anyway, and it doesn't, I think it is the better product though really there isn't a lot of difference in any of the products I tried.  Thing is, 3 bags of Nutiva is a bucket and a half of Rocky Mountain's......so if you buy in 2's like I do, then for $36 or $37 you get 3 buckets worth.  With Rocky, you get 2 buckets for $32 or $33, so the extra bucket is like, only $5.....what I also found was that the packets they send them in are very good/well resealable....so I keep them so I can put about 7 or 8 tablespoon full in one bag, cause it fits so well in my briefcase to take to work, and the spoon fit wholly inside the package too!  It is really convienient.  Anyway....thats it.....=)  Free shipping too...."
5.0,"Wow, much better...","Wow, this is really good for carbonate juice. I like this one better than Switch's orange mandarin flavor. I can actually see myself drinking this one often. The great thing about it is that it's actually healthy, unlike other sodas. So now I can drink this like a soda, but feel good about it because it's good for me."
1.0,Not 10 calories as Advertised,"At 50 calories per bottle, it has 5x the calories they advertise. Not sure why they need to mislead in the Amazon description."
5.0,It's the best!,I'm so glad I found this mix.  Each recipe I try I have loved.  I can't get enough of the scones.  I get compliments on them all the time!
1.0,grossly overpriced,"$30 for 12?  You gotta be kidding.  that's $2.50 per for colored water!  You can buy this stuff anywhere (and I do) for $1 per bottle- Target, local grocery, etc."
1.0,Good product but shop around,"Nothing wrong with the product - I have bought this many times before.  However... it wasn't really clear that the Liquid Nation description of a Double Pack really means 1 bulk bag per the photo.  So for over $50 including shipping you get 32 cups of coffee.  Now that's expensive whichever way you look at it. Shop around and you will find bulk packs of 80 cups for only $2-3 more including shipping.  Shame on me for getting ripped off, I won't be using Liquid Nation ever again."
5.0,Buddy loves them!,"These save my stuff.  Buddy is a chewer, and having these to satisfy the urge is great for me."
5.0,Amazing!!,"Wow I really really liked it. Stevia is way bitter compared to this. Necteresse has a very pleasant honey like taste and absolute no bad bitter one. Its great in tea, but I haven't tried in coffee yet. Im very surprised that some people didn't give it give stars. Its natural and zero calories what more can you ask for?"
1.0,Last Eight O'Clock was BAD,"We have been happy with prior orders of this product, but the latest shipment consisted of very light colored beans and the coffee produced  was much too weak.  We won't order coffee on line again."
5.0,Milky Way Simply Caramel - Incredible!,"This candy bar is absolutely amazing!  I have not eaten candy bars in years but when I saw this I had to try it as I adore caramel and chocolate.  I like to cut it into 6 slices and freeze them in a container.  I suck on 1 or 2 in the evening as a splendid treat; lasting longer because it's frozen.  In addition, if your watching your weight you can still indulge.  Each slice is only 1 Weight Watcher point; and well worth it!  If I could rate it a 10 I would.  You will not be disappointed; I highly recommend it to all.  Cudos to Milky Way."
5.0,Great (wink/wink) Coffee!,"I love the Teccinno herbal coffees and I/m starting to like them better than actual coffee. The 3 pack is a great price especially with auto delivery. It would be unaffordable otherwise. I plan on mixing up my auto delivery with different flavors. But this Maya French Roast is probably the best imitation of coffee in the line. However, starting to find out that everything is good especially with a little Soy Creamer to go with it!"
1.0,Where is the taste?,"I like my coffee strong but not bitter.  Douwe Egberts is generally so so coffee but it at least has some taste. These Senseo coffee pods are different; no taste whatsoever!  It is as if they shipped old pods that had been sitting outside their packaging for a long time. Very disappointing.  Note that I do get a ""care package"" from friends in the Netherlands sometimes which includes a dark roast coffee Senseo pod, also from Douwe Egberts. The package is different and contains more pods, more importantly the taste is entirely different."
5.0,"Nice coffee, great value","A flavorful, low-acid coffee, our standard brew.  Consistently gets high marks from dinner guests, a good endorsement in a coffee town like Seattle.  Amazon price is consistently lower than local supermarkets."
5.0,Nice wine,This wine was much better than I expected from a $40 wine kit.  I kegged mine and charged it with a little CO2.  It's my wifes favorite
5.0,Ring Pops,"The Ring Pops came in a container that looks like what was pictured, and each were individually wrapped as shown. The label was different, but that's fine as there's a disclaimer right above the product description about that. My Ring Pops came in good condition; they weren't in pieces and are as enjoyable as any other Ring Pop you may have had.  The flavors I got were cherry, watermelon, blue raspberry, strawberry, berry blast, and twisted blue raspberry watermelon. Yours may vary."
5.0,every dog loves these treats!,These all natural treats are a favorite for my crew. Price is great and free shipping can't be beat.
5.0,Great product,I am always looking for healthy choices in food and products to help lower cholesterol without taking medication. This product is definitely not available in our area. Amazon has it all!
1.0,Horrible!,We cooked the noodles as per the directions and served them up with a sauce over top - they were HORRIBLE! Very rubbery in texture. Everything went right into the garbage.
1.0,BLAND!,Yuck!  This stuff has no flavor at all.  I donated the other five boxes to a food bank.
1.0,"Coffee Maker Broke, so USELESS","I was able to taste this coffee, even though my Dolce Gusto coffee maker broke.  fyi, the Dolce Gusto has a user screen that over time, for me, started to fritz more and more, showing only a blank screen - the internal software apparently can fritz quite a bit.  That screen is where you choose the type coffee you want to make and also where you are told to insert the coffee capsules, etc., so when it's blank you have to guess.  The coffee tastes a bit stale, unfortunately.  fyi, when my Dolce-Gusto machine broke, the Dolce Gusto folks, after having me on the phone for an hour having me look at minute serial numbers and trying to noodle out where I bought it, made it clear that they are only in search of marketing info - but they only told me that AFTER wasting my time, when they sent me on to a different company to start the complaint process all over again.  The machine is going back, and I won't be buying this coffee anymore!  Having tried almost every flavor, none of them were good enough to justify the hassle or the per cup expense.  I also own a Senseo, that uses paper per serving pods instead of the Dolce Gusto plastic per serving capsules, and the bottom line is that I'll happily  stick with my tried and true simple, more  environmentally friendly, paper single serving pods Hamilton Beach brewer   Hamilton Beach Two Way Brewer Single Serve and 12 cup Coffee Maker "
5.0,"Works great, decent taste...","I've used these drinks since I discovered them many years ago... started with Red Bulls, but sometimes I just didn't want all that much to drink... so I found the 5-hour energy shots.  Used them almost daily until I couldn't afford them anymore... went to the ""Rock On"" shot from Walgreens because they were much cheaper and I could the 6-packs 2-for-1... Been using them for over a year and I just saw these so I bought a bunch... at $1 a piece, they are the cheapest and were basically the same as the rest...  They work just as well as the rest.  Ingredients are all similar, some minor differences:  this has an ""enzyme blend""...  this also has slightly more of the ""energy blend"" than others (the energy blend is a combination of Taurine, Malic Acid, Caffeine, among other things).  It has 0 calories, some other products do have a few calories.  This also has a bit of Niacin which can give some a slight tingly feeling in their skin for a few minutes... I've taken Niacin before and gotten that tingly feeling, but don't get that with this drink.  This also has a small bit of Sodium.  The taste is the same as all the other energy drinks.  They all have a slight aftertaste.  I actually like Grape and Berry the best.  The Orange has always been my worst flavor in all the drinks.  Again, they are all similar.  There is no real difference in taste or in aftertaste.  The effect of all these drinks is profound.  Not in a bad way, they make me much more productive at work.  I sit behind a desk most of the day and 1 of these in the morning keeps me alert and more focused throughout the day.  When not at work, I will usually be very lazy around the house, but take one of these, and I'm cleaning the attic in a few minutes, and planning my next activity while doing that!  I don't notice any crash, none at all.  Just don't take it too late in the day.  Anything after 5:00 or so and I won't sleep until well into the morning.  :-)  I'm glad these are around.  My wife used to take B12 shots for energy back in the day.  She'd get it from a registered nurse in a gym... until people would walk in on them and think they were doing steroids.  :-(  So a shot of this is much more acceptable in public.  :-)  Enjoy!"
1.0,Not what I expected...,This product wasn't what I expected...it had a funky smell and it had a crunchy texture...it also didn't sit to well with my stomach if you know what I mean...I would not recommend this product...I still have some at home that I will just throw away...
1.0,Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup,"Healthy Choice Chicken Dumplings Soup. TRUST ME, This soup is HORRIBLE. Does not taste like any soup I've Ever tasted. No Chicken Flavor. Taste more like the metal can. Vegetables are hard. Heating the soup longer won't make the vegetables softer. Dumplings are more like a flour ball, no flavor. I'll never buy healthy choice again. Zero Stars."
5.0,Makes great home made granola,"I used this to make Molly Wizenberg's everyday granola, from the Bon Appetit article, using coconut oil for the oil in the recipe and it is delicious. I have a soy intolerance so it was good to find this product with no soy in it."
1.0,Made in China???,"I brought home a box of these thinking I had found a good nutrition bar.  Fortunately I didn't open the box of bars because when I saw the ""Made in China"" on the box, I immediately stopped. Unbelievable.  What is wrong with these companies that are having food made in China.  I wouldn't ever buy another Mrs. May product again, particularly any that are made in China."
1.0,it's INSTANT COFFEE!  :-(,"As soon as I picked up the box I could tell I was in trouble, it was so light it could not be real ground coffee. It is just bad INSTANT COFFEE! (in Amazon's defense it is listed as INSTANT COFFEE in the heading, but no were on the box does it say it is instant.) I was in a hurry when I ordered... I will not do that again."
5.0,Magic Potion from South America.,"Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word ""mati"" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.  In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.  Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts."
1.0,I do not like this product !,"HARMONY HOUSE..a NC family owned company.  I do not care for this product.  It is not as tasty at other Harmony House fruits.  I believe most H H products are bought by campers and backpackers...I just use them for the home. I also feed them to my parrots and RES turtles. My grandkids eat them for snacks.  It is healthy.  Was very fast shippping. BUT,I believe HH shipping is high.  bbp okc ok 63 retired"
1.0,Slimy and disgusting,"Bought this REALLY hoping to like it, as Stonewall's Jerquee is so expensive, but this stuff is repulsive.  For one thing, isn't jerky, by definition, supposed to be dry?  This stuff comes covered in a greasy, slimy coating.  After trying hard to get passed that, on to the actual jerky...it's not chewy, like jerky is supposed to be, it is too easy to bite off a piece.  And the flavor is beyond description, in a bad way.  I've tried almost all of the flavors now, and would never buy ANY of them again.  They have a weird perfumey taste.  So, they're slimy and taste awful.  That about sums it up."
1.0,"Doesn't work. I have 4 different types of traps, and this is the only one that is empty.","Even the cheap 'ribbon' traps have caught many dozens of flies in the few days I've had them, and the liquid bait traps (Rescue, and Victor's Fly Magnet) have caught hundreds in a few days, but this thing remains empty (the best seems to be the Rescue trap, I call ""the stinker"", because it reeks, but it works). This trap is in the same space as the other traps, and there are hundreds of flies out there. Just does not work. While it is an ""indoor"" trap, the directions say that it can be used outdoors if protected by weather, which it is."
1.0,"careful, moldy product, USDA now involved","My baby enjoyed this flavor when I purchased it at a store.  I ordered a case of it from Amazon.  the whole case arrived moldy.  Each jar popped when I opened it too, showing that it was properly sealed.  I contacted Earth's Best.  They said they would look into it but would not follow up with me.  Given what is going on in our food industry, I will not purchase any more products from this company.  It is to scary when feeding a baby.  Amazon refunded me but did not take it any further.  Be very careful and inform other families too.  UPDATE:  I was so disappointed with the lack of concern from Earth's Best and Amazon.  I contacted the FDA, they referred me to the USDA because the product contained meat.  They took it very serious and had also received several complaints.  They have come to my house and written a report.  If anyone else noticed this problem please contact the USDA (1-888-674-6854). to report your claim/problem.  They will investigate the problem and the Earth's Best Plant to make sure they are following regulations."
1.0,WARNING:  They use CORN for this product,"NOW has a policy to use Non-GMO'd products when possible BUT they can't guarantee that this product is produced from NON-GMO corn.  With their low prices and the majority of corn produced in the US is GMO'd, I have to assume it's a GMO'd product.  Isn't that just great!!!!  And, Amazon has a NO RETURN policy on food items, so I am stuck with it."
5.0,Best Pickle or Chutney in the World,"Always spread it on any cheese or try it with a Jacket Potato, Grated Cheese and then put the pickle on top..  Luscious and chunky  David http://www.britishchap.com"
5.0,"Good product, fast delivery","My local grocery, Krogers, stopped having some of my favorite Worthington products. Fortunately, now, I have an alternate source."
5.0,great coffee,"the is a great tasting coffee.  when the local stores don't have it or are pricing it crazy, I can always get it from here."
5.0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"GOT THIS STUFF AT THE "" INTERNATIONAL MARKET"" IN LAS VEGAS. FOUR BUCKS,WHAT THE HELL I'LL TRY IT. PUT SOME  IN A CUP, AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW IT'S GREAT. WITH THE CREAM,SUGAR AND COFFEE IN ONE POUCH ITS REALLY HANDY. THE PEOPLE AT ""KOPIKO"" MUST OF CAME UP WITH THE PERFECT BLEND OF SUGAR AND CREAM TO SATISFY MOST CONSUMERS. I MAY TAKE THIS AT WORK AND SELL IT FOR .50  A BAG."
5.0,Great for giving pet meds!,Pill Pockets have been a great way for me to give my Daschaund his meds! He takes 3 pills a day and this provides a way to protect my fingers and get his meds down with no fuss. Great product!
1.0,Very unhappy with order,One out of the six of these boxes was opened when I received it.  But even more disappointing is that almost every single box there is more crumbs then there is goldfish.  Wont be buying these again for my child care center.
5.0,Great Product With Little Appreciation,I was shocked to discover that Amazon has a supply of this great product. I have been searching high and low in every grocery store and market for it. I had finally given up and switched to other flavors. They pale in comparison. This flavor is stronger and can stand to be mixed with more water that the recommended 4 quarts. I will do my best to buy the remainder that is available.
1.0,Disappointed!!!,"My dog just loves these treats.  Wish I could buy them locally, I have not found any stores that still carry this product.  Have ordered before with little problems.  This time the seal was broken and the treats were as hard as a ROCK!!!  not worth shipping them back, and will never purchase again!!"
1.0,old candy,"This product arrived on time but it sure wasn't fresh.  The caramel part is hard and one must hold it in their mouth awhile to soften it up so it is chewy.  If this had been the first product I purchased thru Amazon I would not be purchasing any more thru you.  I have purchased the vanilla caramel creams locally many times and they were nice and soft and chewy.  Cannot get the strawberry or chocolate flavored creams here so decided to order thru Amazon, much to my disappointment.  Will never order from Office Snax again.  Hope this can prevent someone else from getting stuck with stale candy.  Lorraine Oelschlager  I ordered the Office Snax Goetz's Caramel Cream Assorted,  24-Ounce Tub  (Pack of 3)"
1.0,not lemon balm?,"Ordered this stuff because of the wonderful antiox etc you retrieve from lemon balm, kind of stunk you could only purchase 3 at a time instead of one. But I grow lemon balm in my own garden and dry it for teas etc, and with this I thought YAY none i have to dry and wait for the tea myself. But from observing it NO SMELL of lemons in the tea can itself..as a tea I dont taste any lemon...so makes me wonder what it really is only because with my experience with lemon balm as an herb smells and taste like a lemony scent..with this nothing."
1.0,Why must I spend 30 minutes googling for ingredients and allergen information  when they should be listed here?,"ngredients: Flour (rice, potato, tapioca, corn, soya), golden syrup, dairy-free margarine (vegetable oils, water, salt (2%, emulsifier (polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, mono & diglycerides), colours (turmeric and annatto)), sugar, ginger, raising agents: sodium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate. Allergy advice: Contains soya.  Made in a nut free factory. Do not guarantee nut free."
5.0,Heavenly,"Words escape me when I bite into one of these scrumptious chocolates.  First of all, they are large - easily 2 bites worth.  Secondly, well, they are toooooooo yummy for words.  We all have our favorites but I guess you'll have to try them all and pick your own favorite choices - that is, if you can."
5.0,Excellent 0-calorie filler!,"I love this product! Don't buy this expecting it to taste like rice on its own. I buy this and mix it with EVERYTHING, for added 0-calorie bulk. I feel fuller and eat less calories of whatever it was I mixed it with. The texture and taste is pretty much unnoticeable when mixed. I like to buy frozen diet dinner and mix whatever I got with an equal or slightly less portion of Miracle rice, and voila! Twice as much food for the same amount of calories, more filling!"
5.0,Delicious coffee,"My husband is the coffee lover in our family, and he ordinarily doesn't care for flavored coffee. I'm just an occasional coffee drinker. When I read the description and other very positive reviews of this coffee, I thought we'd give it a try and am so glad we did. We absolutely love it. The beans as beautiful and glossy when you open the package. The aroma when grinding the beans is fantastic. As other reviewers stated, the flavor holds up to brewing; this is one of the few coffees we've tried that tastes as good as it smells. Guests in our home have raved about this coffee and we have been asked repeatedly where it was purchased. The price with Subscribe & Save is close to what we'd pay in the grocery store for beans of lesser quality. We are repeat customers, and I suspect we will be for a very long time."
5.0,excellent product,love these dry roasted blanched almonds.  These are so difficult to find especially the ones with no oils.  will continue to purchase these.
5.0,good fomula,My son take breast-feeding a lot. so 8 fl oz is perfect size to store once open.it is great product for traving.
1.0,shipped wrong beans!,"Company sent wrong beans and they will not except return of beans or ship beans ordered. Unfair, this company should not be allowed to send whatever they feel and deprive a coffee drinker his beans of choice. That is why I paid the premium price, was to get the beans I wanted shipped direct and allow me the opportunity to grind them cup for cup."
5.0,A quality food cats love,"All of my cats like this food, including the two that generally only eat wet food if it's tuna. It is a tightly packed food and you can definitely spot the big chunks of sardine among the chicken. And it is a good value as far as quality, natural cat food goes. It is made with human-grade ingredients and no byproducts or fillers. I want to try more varieties of Natural Value to add to my cats' diet."
5.0,Healthy Snacks,"These crackers are healthier for you than most, and yet are very tasty and light.  I really enjoy them."
5.0,Yummy..........,These bars were so good.  I'm planning to order more and try the different flavors.  They were fresh and the nuts and chocolate were great.
5.0,Great Buy,"I am a chef, love Olive oil cook everything with Oive oil(at home) and almost try every brand in the market.Napoleon Extra Virgin is in top five, great for salad and very good for cooking.and the price is much better than supermrket."
1.0,Coating is very sweet,Please just save your money it has a very sweet after taste from a carmel coating that also has a very off smell.
5.0,even better than arrowmills gf pancake mix,"i didn't think there was any product out there that could surpass arrowheadmills' gluten free pancake mix, but i've been proven wrong. this buttermilk pancake mix is absolutely wonderful. it's light, fluffy and soft and just so delicious. there is no off flavor at all-it's just like normal tasting pancakes but even better because it's gluten free!!! i got it at whole foods and i was excited to get it here in bulk but they don't have it in stock-poopey! i'm going to hustle to go back and get a few even though it's pricey over there-it is just that good!! i used an entire box the other morning for my three kids (i just had a little piece and i wanted more) and we couldn't get enough. hope to stock up soon again  updated (1/3/11):  I was pleasantly surprised to see amazon finally have it in stock, unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed that it's priced at $8.15, while Wild by Nature has it for $5.99 and Whole Foods is around that price as well.  Oh well, thought I could have ordered in bulk.  Guess I'll have to make the trips to the specialty stores after all.  updated (3/23/11):  Now I notice amazon reduced the price to $5.12, however, I still get it cheaper at the specialty grocery stores because I buy it in bulk-when you buy an entire box that has at least 6-8 of these you get a discount and in the end each box comes out a little less than five dollars.  In regards to one review that complained about the middle of the pancake batter not cooking, it's most likely because the mix was made too thick. This gluten free mix is really, really good and I've tried it in many different ways, with coconut milk, almond milk, no matter what I do, it comes out beautiful and cooked through and through. I have nothing to gain about pushing this product, I'm a regular mom of three, but I know the struggle of providing nice ""normal"" tasting foods for your family when you can't have gluten in your diets. This mix is worth the try and if it's not cooking well, which I never have a problem with, then just add a bit of water to thin it out and also watch that the heat isn't too high or else the outside will cook faster than the inside (this is common advice for regular pancake mix as well)."
1.0,Crushed Cans,"Got the package here in Afghanistan.  Cans were all damaged, but the packaging was intact? Hmmm.  The cans that were not damaged went Ok.  Lost 5 in all."
1.0,Yucky,The cooked result was too gritty. Skip these and buy Pamela's Chunky Chocolate chip cookies. You can eat them right out of the box and they taste good.
1.0,Do not buy this product,"Do not buy this product if you expect Familia Original recipe.  The product description claims that this is the original recipe in a newly designed package, but this is not the case.  I had been buying Familia for years.  Perhaps the formula is the same but the product I received was not the milled grain I expected. It was more like puffed wheat; think sugar puffs without the sugar.  It was like eating cardboard.  To their credit, Amazon gave me a refund."
1.0,Review of Gluten Free Pizza Crust,"The Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Pizza Crust was really bad.  The taste and texture.  Also one of the bags had burst open and there was flour all over in the box.  I ordered three different boxes of Gluten Free products with four bags in each box, and the end bag in each box had burst open.  I just called Bob's Red Mill and they were extremely nice and just sent me the bags right away."
5.0,"Excellent product for baking, but,...","First, I love this brand of powdered buttermilk and I have been baking with it for over 17 years. That being said,...Saco needs to make a better container that will stand up to shipping this item via Amazon.com. The first shipment I received arrived dented so badly that all of the seals were broken and part of the buttermilk powder had escaped into the packing material. The replacement wasn't in much better shape except that thankfully the seals were in tact and none of product had leaked out.  Saco powdered buttermilk will harden over time in its original container and so it is best immediately transferred into a sealed glass or plastic container once opened to keep freshest and easiest to work with. I bake a lot of bread and baked goods each week and this brand of buttermilk is always my go-to ingredient that makes a superior tasting loaf/muffins/croissants with a slightly sourdough aroma due to the subtle tartness of the buttermilk.  Definitely worth keeping stocked up in the pantry for all of your baking needs!"
1.0,what!!!???,"Something is seriously wrong with this listing.  12 bottles, 16.9 oz each, for $90.  impossible.  If this is for real, then they are WAY overpriced."
1.0,Won't buy this again,First off let me state Amazon and the retailer did nothing wrong. The problem I had is with the product itself. Even tho it was well within it's expiration date when I opened it it was obviously stale and nasty to eat.
1.0,O.N.E. Coconut water,"My most recent delivery of one coconut water tasted sour, I ordered 4 12 packs and by the time I got to the second twelve pack I exceed the return date requirement. I am now very disappointed and stuck with 24 bottles of sour coconut water.  I have a reoccurring order monthly and now plan to cancel all future orders, I will buy it from the local supermarket at least Then i can return the item when not satisfied.  I am very disappointed!!!"
1.0,Little black balls/seeds (smut balls) throughout!,"So I dump my bag of wheat into my existing half full wheat bucket and find the package littered with what seems to be little black seeds of some sort- definitly not wheat!!! Not bugs- but perfectly shaped little black balls.  I have looked for an answer online with no luck...I tried calling the manufacture and the office was closed- I have yeast proofing on the counter that I now have to dump- and my good wheat is now mixed in with the ""bad"".....so basically I'm out of dinner, and money.  Only alot annoyed at this point.  ***Okay this is an add on to the original post- Looks like it's something called smut balls.....a dried fungus ball.  Not toxic- as far as I can see.  But still is considered an unpure grain.  I don't see why I should pay top dollar for less than quality grain and that I paid for weight with these included (i'm guessing 4-5 lbs worth mixed in).  I could sit and pick out millions of these tiny things or just figure out how to get a refund (p.s....i have no idea how I'm going to repackage it for the return).  I will not be a return customer of this product unless it is shown to have improvement."
1.0,Beware of this product!,"It is impossible to find an ingredient list!  On the internet the ingredients start with whole milk powder and vanilla, and nothing else.  What about sugar and cocoa butter?  If you call Ghirardelli, they will tell you, they don't have an ingredient list!  Unfortunately, Trader Joes only carries white chocolate chips around Christmas.  Maybe if enough people called TJs and asked for white chocolate chips, they would carry them the rest of the year.  Hint, hint!"
1.0,"Store Bought, Hawaiian Host Macadamia Nuts.","I just purchased two boxes from a Chinese store in Plano Texas. I could not find a "" Do not sell date "" unless it is the date on the inside cover of the lid. The date is 7/2010. The chocolate has a white coating and has a old tasting Flavor. I will not purchase this product again. I called the company and the voice said I was next in line, However,five minutes went by and no one activated the line, I hung up and give this a 1."
1.0,"Mold, Mold, Mold","The other reviews that discuss brown water and mold? They're all true! The steamer is the perfect home for mold -- dark, moist, and warm. You can't clean it very well, as the steamer can't be submerged in water and the opening for the water is too small to effectively put any brushes in to aid in cleaning. I used vinegar for cleaning, but it doesn't clean entirely. You can still see brown deposits where the water goes. Yum -- just what I want to feed my kid!  But even before the brown water appeared, I found myself using a regular stovetop pot and a food processor to do my baby food. The Beaba Babycook is not designed for making food in bulk. It makes maybe three or four meals for my hungry baby, and I prefer to make a great deal more baby food in one sitting."
1.0,awful,"way way too sweet, how can one eat this. discarded the entire box. what a waste of money. will never again buy this."
1.0,Disappointment,"I'd heard how great this product was, but after trying it, I've found it is NASTY!! If you love peanut butter and I do, this is NO substitute. Yuck!"
5.0,Great taste,I have tried a few other wheat grass powders and had a hard time drinking them. This was very mild. I can drink it just mixed with water. My 2 year old and 4 year old liked it and wanted more. I love all of the Amazing Grass products. They all taste great and are a great company to order from.
1.0,Would not order again,"I was not at all pleased with this product. I regularly purchase Nutiva brand hemp seeds but when I saw the price of this brand I decided to give it a try. As the old adage goes, ""you get what you pay for"". I noticed there were a lot of pieces of the outer shell mixed into the seeds which has a very course texture in contrast to the regular texture. While I can get over that, every day I ate them I would bite into very hard orange crystaly bits which I have to assume aren't digestible. I'm not sure if Manitoba is addings these things as filler as a cheap means of increasing the weight or if they're getting mixed in by accident - in either case though it's unacceptable. I would not recommend this product and would probably not try it again. The extra monetary cost of Nutiva is certainly worth it to forego the filler. On the other hand, Amazon was amazing. Delivery was prompt (ahead of schedule actually) and of course I have nothing bad to say about subscribe and save."
5.0,Exactly what it says it is,this is some good stuff i got it for my meal worms and they are doing much better with this over whole wheat flower
1.0,Not Happy,"The product arrived opened, as though it had been used.  I did not purchase a used product.  Therefore, not happy."
1.0,Warning. Contains milkfat.,"I ordered this chocolate because my highly allergic child cannot eat milk products. When the description indicated the chocolate is lactose free and ""Vegan"" (which usually means no animal products - including dairy) I was thrilled. Like another customer, I was sorely disappointed. Unfortuately I did not read the fine print on the wrapper until after my daughter had eaten some and had severe gastro problems afterwards. Amazon please fix the misleading description."
1.0,Tasteless,This product was very tasteless and boring. I felt like I was eating packaging material..awful awful awful awful!!!!!! Very bland!!!
5.0,"Love the product, hate the cost...","I have tried another low carb Maple...brand, which I am sure many are aware of, however, I prefer the taste of New Hope Mills. New Hope is also much lower in carbs than the the other brands sold in my local supermarket and Amazon. The taste is not rubbery, nor bland. It's easy to make and is an excellent substitute for brands with sugar. I have added crushed or whole almonds or walnuts and periodically a few pecans, a bit of vanilla to increase the fiber for some texture.  What I dislike is the cost via Amazon. I went to the New Hope Mills site and discovered 3 (9oz)boxes for $11.95 or a case of 8 boxes for $25.00! Plus, my local supermarket has offered to order a case for me. Quite a big difference in cost!  So, although I like the convenience of Amazon, I will place future orders directly from New Hope Mills' site.  It's quite exciting to be able to order it in bulk and enjoy pancakes. Hint to Amazon, it would be great if you offer a comparable price w/Prime member benefits!"
1.0,disappointed,"This product is not good when compares to the one I brought form Whole Food. My eyes were not dry and the dark spots on my eyes were gone after I took the bottle from Whole Food but the one I ordered from Amazon did not work.  The powder seems to be lighter and floating on top of the cup a lot more than the real one.  I think this product is not real becasue my sister and I both took it and it did not work. Her dark spots came back and her eyes feel dry again.  Worst of all I want to return the one bottle I ordered earlier, since I threw away the wrapping and they won't accept it back.  They want it to be in the manufacture original packaging and in the same condition as I received it.  I hope Amazon can check the product from this company. I love to order products from Amazon.  Please help me to feel good about ordering products from you again.  Thanks a lot!"
5.0,"I love this product!  It works as a detangler, a protector and it","has some effect as a styling aid.  I have thick, coarse, and colored hair. This product makes it feel more ""in control"".  It has really cut down on the frizziness of my hair.  It seems to give my hair hairspray type control, but leaves it soft to the touch.  I order this now from subscribe and save because my daughter uses it as well, and I don't want to run out.  Amazon also doesn't charge for shipping through this program.  I highly recommend this product if you blow dry or use a staight iron like my daughter."
5.0,This is great stuff,"I was a bit surprised by the previous review, the reviewer obviously didn't do their research. We highly recommend this product - we settled on this one after we lost two beloved dogs to the Chinese poison in dog food incident a few years ago.  We did our research and found this to be the best available.  This is a very healthy base to which you add protein.  Our two Aussies are thriving on this - it has been their main meal for over a year, and they are strong, active, and healthy due in part to the food we give them (we eat organic and healthy, and our dogs do too).  It does smell like alfalfa, but even the most cursory examination reveals a great variety of good, organic foods."
1.0,Vile & Nasty stuff!,"Here is my rant on the ""new"" Kraft Catalina dressing. It is the vilest and nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth!!! I HATE it! I called to complain on their 800 number and the minimum-wage phone jerk told me how they put all their products under taste testing samples and market research. Well, those people they tested must not have any taste buds. Regardless, we don't have Catalina dressing anymore and I don't believe that Kraft is going to listen to us. While this decision is similar to the Coca-Cola disaster in 1985, it doesn't have the same economic impact that the Coke had. Millions of people don't consume Catalina every second of every day like Coke does, so while Kraft might notice some sales declines, I think their stubborn, marketing-minded mentality will keep the new product on the shelves. Too many corporations these days are more concerned with dollars and ""new and improved"" products than maintaining tried-and-true products with loyal customers. These corporations are being infiltrated with young college graduates who don't know, nor care, about value and time-honored traditions. For them, everything is about dumping the old simply because it's old and not relevant anymore. This is happening in all areas of our lives. Anyway, in my refund check from Kraft, they thanked me for being a loyal Kraft customer and looked forward to my continued support. They are so large that they don't have a clue as to what's going on. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I told that phone jerk that I was boycotting ALL products that Kraft makes. I am very angry that they messed with this dressing. I have found an alternative at Wal-Mart. They have their Great Value brand dressing in Honey French and Homestyle French flavors. The better of the two is the Honey French; however, if you combine the two dressings in equal amounts you have a nice tasting French dressing very similar to Catalina. Of course, if you go with the Honey French by itself, it is very similar to the Catalina taste. All that said, the old Catalina had the best balance of flavors and zinginess that I liked. It's so sad!"
1.0,Lousy packaging,"From past experience, I know this is wonderful tuna.  Sadly, 4 out of 4 jars were unsealed when they arrived.  The oil had leaked completely out of one, and none were under vacuum (the paper seals were still intact, but the lids were all loose), making all 4 jars unsafe to eat."
5.0,Excellent coffee,"This is one of the finest examples of how coffee should taste. If you are used to the Seattle dark roasted beans you may find this to much of a stretch. The Starbucks and most Seattle coffees are not made with Arabica beans and the heavy roasting is used to mask cheap coffee beans. Unfortunately with the demise of the A&P grocery chain in most of the US it is harder to find Eight o Clock and more expensive, however, it is finding it's way into other stores. A good friend of ours from Germany, where coffee is an obsession, said this was the best she has ever had other than Dallmayr coffee."
1.0,Fake!,"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.  HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.  I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."
1.0,Way too bland for my taste,"As with any food product, your opinion may differ. I found that this meal was very short on flavor, and not visually appealing. It does not look at all like the picture on the cover. The pasta, the chicken and the 'sauce' were all the same color. The 'sauce' appeared to be some melted cheese food product. I should have tried this first from the (more expensive) store that sells them in units, not packages, because with this item, eating it once was more than enough."
1.0,Not good,I just got this in the mail... all I can say is that the Wispa was broken into about 200 pieces and loads like it has been on a shelf for about 5 years.  It is like someone hit it against a table for 10 minutes.  Disappointing.
5.0,a dangerous decision,"These cherries are SO Good! sigh...to me, these are a real treasure in my pantry.....they are delicious and fairly priced ( although I see the price jumps around) and store easily in my cool, cool storage. It is really thrilling for me to have these to bake in scones with sliced almonds and mix with popcorn and nuts with chocolate coating for snacking and what a special component for my trail mix. Cherries don't grow where I live and I have missed them more than any other fruit since moving here."
1.0,Yuck!,"This stuff is terrible, and full of sweeteners and artificial ingredients. It leaves a sick aftertaste. Not recommended at all."
5.0,Love this drink!,I really enjoy this drink!  The fact that it is made with stevia is the big reason  I even looked at this product. The flavor doesn't over power you and is refreshing.
1.0,Necco Banana Split Candy,I am disappointed in this product.  It has little flavor and would benefit from salt & butter.  I expected it to taste like the Banana Beich Caramels we ate when I was young.  We don't like it!  gp
1.0,Very Disappointed,"I wasn't very pleased with this product.  It's nothing like what the description said.  The pieces were smashed and torn, and they tasted like they were heavily syruped.  I could barely taste the actual longan.  I think I would've been better off buying the canned ones."
1.0,Metallic smell on food,"I absolutely loved this product at first.  I had one of the first models and it worked wonderfully until one day it simply wouldn't turn on.  I called the company and they sent me a new model.  The steam chamber of the new model smells horrible, I can't quite pinpoint the smell but it is somewhere between metallic and burnt plastic.  All the food I've steamed also has this metallic taste to it.  I've done the cleaning with distilled vinegar and distilled water twice already but the food still tastes metallic.  This freaks me out because I have no idea what is being deposited on the food. Obviously I won't be giving any steamed food to my baby. I've called customer service again and I'm waiting for a call back."
1.0,OMG can you say MSG?,"I used to by this all the time but had trouble locting a store that carried it. Now I wish I hadn't! The potatoes are made of some foriegn substance and the cheese sause was so saly it almost crunched. My husband has an iron stomach and it even sent him running to the pot! Come to think of it, in the last year all of the hamburger helper varieties have gone bad! Shame, when you both work full time it was such a great convienience! No more - unless you want a ""trotts"" diet."
1.0,maybe i got a bad case,"after multiple tries its always the same, the popcorn pops about 50%. it is definitely bad popcorn because i succesfully used the oil pack with my own popcorn and achieved great results. i found it interesting that there is no date code on either the case or the packages. isn't there a law about that or something?"
1.0,YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED,$15 for ONE pack of Oreos?! You should be ashamed of yourself for taking advantage of people. Do not give your money to these money hungry people!!
1.0,Zero calorie with horrible taste,I bought this and gave it my all. I even mixed it with real peanut butter. It was horrible and just pitched it. Please do not buy. If it sounds too good to be true then it is. This was just horrible
5.0,A perfect blend of flavors!,"Dove's Raspberry Chocolate pairing is just fantastic.  The chocolate is smooth and the raspberry flavor compliments the dark chocolate flavor so well.  I'm not a real dark chocolate fan, but this combo really works!"
1.0,Worm found on Greenies Joint Care,"Just opened Greenies Joint Care (individually sealed) in December 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it.  Next one looked fine, but really supposed to trust these now?"
5.0,Lee Kum Kee Guilin Chili Sauce,The BEST sauce!!!!  I stir fry green beans and then just stir in a teaspoon or so - it is very hot so a little goes a long way.  My friends all love it and some of them say it is their favorite vegetable.
1.0,Mushroom Popcorn,"Try as I may this popcorn could not live up the my expectations. I have a hot air popper that makes large fluffy POP SECRET. Followed there instructions on heating the popper for 5 mins. Did not pop complete, and they were on the small side and hard not fluffy. It's back to POP SECRET."
5.0,excellent product,"its more economical to buy this on amazon.com than in the grocery store.  fit works and i swear by it!  all our produce is covered with chemicals and you can see the difference after you ""fit"" your produce!  i never knew blueberries weren't supposed to have that white coat over them!  they r actually dark blue!  and you will see this gross layer on the top of the water (and the water will turn milky white - while the fit is a clear solution) if you have kids this is a MUST!  i dont eat any produce until it's been fitted!"
5.0,My dog loves these!,I always make sure I'm stocked with these bones to occupy my dog for at least 30-60 minutes at a time. He chews the same bone for 2 or 3 days. He satisfies his chewing instinct and stays away from my boyfriend's shoes. They're perfect for medium sized dogs who are powerful chewers.
1.0,ordering the wrong coffee - no image available,I went into K-cups to order K-cups.  This product didn't have an image and I didn't read the product carefully - after all I went into K-cups - why would there be another product in K-cups or why wasn't there an image.  Also didn't read that this item is nonreturnable.  Now I have coffee that I can't use.  Lesson learned - don't order when there is no image available and read the fine print!
1.0,Bland and watery,"I read several of the reviews before signing up for a subscription for this coffee. Usually Amazon customers are spot on, but in this case the reviews didn't help. This coffee is really weak, watery, and bland. Ever tried running water through a K-cup a second time? It's awful and tastes much like this coffee. AND SINCE IT IS A SUBSCRIPTION, IT'S NON RETURNABLE. That's right, I can't return a $30 order. Be sure you like this stuff before signing up or risk getting stuck with some really bad coffee."
5.0,"THIS is SUGAR, the way it should be!",I don't keep refined sugar any more!  THIS is sugar the way it was meant to taste!
5.0,Healthy and does the job,A great way to get a boost in the morning with no crash later. Also very good for you.
5.0,Delicious,"Most kids' cereals are too sugary and/or chemical-tasting, but Golden Grahams is a classic cereal that I have been enjoying for a long time. It's hard to not enjoy the sweet taste of honey and graham mixed together, and as far as staying crunchy in milk, it does get soggy after a while, but if you limit your portion size or use small bowls and eat two small bowls instead of one big one, the cereal stays crunchy to the last bite."
5.0,OUTSTANDING!!!,"My great aunt was here and wanted to make fruit filled cookies for me.  I searched my pantry and found this sitting on my shelf, I had purchased it on clearance some time back but didn't know what to do with it.  She used the whole jar to fill her rolled and cut cookies and they ended up being my new favorite cookie.  this spread is the best fruit filling I have ever had in a cookie.  Now I am ordering more to use on toast and to make some more cookies since we ate all of my aunts."
5.0,Go to treat,"This is a household staple for our dear dog who loves the taste. These treats are moist and firm enough for a few chews. They will dry  if left in the open, which is why we have a vacuum sealed container to put them in. The size is perfect-- it really is the size of a pencil eraser. We usually get the salmon because the smell is irresistible to our dog. When I have them around, a whiff and a look from me and our dog is sitting & staying for a treat. We also stuff a kong with it sometimes. We have 2 more bags around just so that we don't run out. We tried the peanut butter, it was great too but we keep coming back to salmon."
5.0,My kids both love these,Both my kids love these mum mums.  I have to constantly tell my 3 1/2 year old daughter that these are for babies.  Every baby that I know of has loved these.
1.0,Not brand new??,"I got the product yesterday.  The bag looked like it was opened and glued back together.  I was very hesitant to open it but my dog is running out of food...  It is just insane to believe that the original EVO packaging is so bad.  It wasn't air-sealed and the top fold looks messy.  Again, it looks like some one roll it and glue it together. (like how we would seal it at home!!)  This is the first time I got such a bad quality dog food product.  VERY disappointed.  And I do demand an explanation if the seller cares about their business!!  I will not recommend this to anyone."
5.0,Mouthwatering.........,A local winery sold this pasta for quite a bit more than it is sold here for. I decided to try it.... Everyone in my family of five LOVED it... my 7 year old daughter and I argued over who got it for breakfast the next morning. It was that good. The best pasta I have ever had (I am 40 and love my pasta). It is better than any resturant's pasta..... I highly recommend it and am buying a case! :)
1.0,Pricing is out of line - 2X the price of buying them from Nespresso,"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.  Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better."
5.0,Oat Bran,"This is a delicious product that I would never have known about until I needed it for a special diet. As a hot breakfast cereal, it is smooth and creamy and takes very little time to make. It is filling and last a long time."
1.0,floss sugar,"this item gets only 1 star from me because the green apple flavored floss sugar tastes nasty nasty nasty. its so bitter tasting your whole face puckers up. its not a sweet sour taste. its more like koolaide with no sugar in it. luckily i was able to add some banana flavored floss sugar to the green apple floss sugar and it sweetened it up some. i have tried other flavors of floss sugar, blue raspberry, strawberry, pink vanilla and banana and this is the first flavor i absolutely hate. LOL , i dont blame the seller though. i always purchase my sugar from paragon and will continue to do so. i will just stick to the flavors i know taste good  Paragon Magic Cotton Candy Floss, 4-Pound Easy Pour Bottle (Green Apple) "
1.0,weird stuff,"tastes - burnt, roasted, slightly rotten sunflower seed taste; gritty, bland - no salt,sugar only seeds. would not eat if it was free."""
1.0,never showed up,never showed up. don't know what happend to it. no one has tried to get in contact with me. not to happy about this.
5.0,Interesting Cereal,"The chocolate taste really does taste like chocolate and not some dark cocoa mixture. The chocolate inside is not necessarily velvety, but definitely not solid solid. Overall, pretty good tasting chocolate. Texture is good too. Not really crunchy crunchy, but not soft either. Not really sure how healthy this would be for breakfast, but it's a nice sweet snack."
1.0,Spiders,I found 2 spiders in my babies formula and was disgusted so I had to write this review.  Now I am stuck with three giant cans of this formula and am not going to chance my babies health by trying it again.
5.0,Awesome Flavor,"This was my first purchase from this vendor. The quality of the product is great, the price is awesome and the packaging protected the shipment from any damage. I also bought another variety in the same 5-lb bag size. I've already roasted about a pound of each and am very happy with the results. I am very partial to the Sumatra. Getting a nice dark roast without burning is always a challenge but it seemed easier with these beans. When the oils were released from the beans the aroma was excellent. Will be buying more from this vendor."
1.0,Terrible,"I don't know if I got an old batch but this stuff is horrible.  Mine has no malt flavor.  In fact, it has almost no flavor to it all.  It is bland and disgusting."
1.0,Leaking Jars,"Not sure how it tastes but the shipment arrived very late.  I would have maybe been able to deal if that was the extent of the problem but as far as I can tell, all three jars were leaking after I opened the box.  Salsa all over the place is not my idea of fun!  I find this interesting since I'm not the first person to complain about this.  No expiration codes on jars have me wondering if it's still fresh even if they weren't leaking.  Does quality control exist at Arriba?  I do not recommend this product until these issues are resolved!"
5.0,Vegetarians Delight,"My Mother, now 94 years old and resides alone without help, has been a vegetarian for over 50 years. She LOVES the LOMA LINDABrand, (especially the BIG FRANKS), and when she tried others, always went back to these. I am so happy to find them on AMAZON.com, and can give her a pantry full. She eats a FRANK a day, and has so many little ways to prepare them. They keep after opening very well. Thank You, AMAZON and LOMA LINDA! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BEZVW2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img"
5.0,Yum,"A friend brought me one of these candy bars from Portland about two years ago, and I'm still craving it. I didn't know if I'd like it, but I loved it. If you have an adventurous palate, and you like curry and coconut, I think you'll like it. I wish I had one (or more) right now."
1.0,No time to enjoy it,"Got the product, with an expiration date of 2 days after I received the product.  Was hoping to give it as a gift... ended up throwing it away.  Understand perishable, but not something that is unedible."
5.0,franks is great!,"Ok, now i never would have thought to buy this online and not in bulk for sure. however i recently had my local grocery stores stop carrying it. this is great on coconut shrimp/chicken. great flavor. good size. however it does take up a little bit of space in the fridge which is a downsize. but i mean, its franks. it will be gone in a month or so anyways!"
5.0,Outstanding Product,"This was my first experience with Quinoa.  I have read much about its benefits, but have always been on the fence about trying it (especially with two small children to please). We bought some when this was on sale at Amazon, and I couldn't be happier.  It makes a delicious nutty rice-like dish that can be a side to any meal or even the base of a meat-free meal (we try to go meat-free once a week).  Any way, my wife and I were instantly hooked, and even the kids eat it without complaint.  My son calls it 'Bob the Builder dirt' (the grains are quite small and that's an accurate description of the color) and eats plate fulls of the stuff."
1.0,Stop Before You Buy,"I was going to purchase this item until I took a look at the ingredients. MSG is in the ingredients list. Unfortunately, that substance is very very bad for your health. Please reseach MSG online for more info. I have a central nervous system disorder and MSG sets off some pretty terrible symptoms in my body.  I would like to see a product like this that has no MSG for those of us who choose not to consume it or for those that want to guard their health."
5.0,acai miracle ?,"Unfortunately acai isn't the super diet supplement,  but it does have high levels of antioxidants.This particular jar is by far the best way to buy,tast great when mixed in a blender and is the cheapest on the market."
5.0,One of the worlds finest waters,Volvic has no equal amongst water on the market. It is pricey but if you are able to taste the difference in water taste this will put a smile on your face and a smile from your body as you drink it. Volvic comes from france with a perfect balance of mineral flavors. I have difficulty drinking straight water as most bottled water has no taste and is just wet like poland spring. I can drink volumes of volvic water easily due to the great refreshing taste. I cannot do that with tasteless water like poland spring and fiji waters. Fiji is also expensive but it is just a fancy bottle with tasteless water. Cost does not guarantee quality taste. If you have never experienced the taste of a good water you will if you try this. Always chill volvic for best results before drinking in the bottle it came in. Addition of ice not originated from volvic may alter the taste. The flavor of good water comes from the mineral content and volvic has a perfect blend. Enjoy P.s. You can find it cheaper at whole foods
5.0,Best coconut water out there,"I LOVE this Coconut Water! It's delicious and super refreshing and what's even better is that it's only 110 calories and 26 carbs for the entire can, much less than other coconut waters or sports drinks. I also really love that it's all natural- no fillers, concentrates, or any other unpronounceable additives. Just straight up coconut water = delicious. You won me over!"
1.0,Licorice allsorts no stars,They were hard and not editable so threw them out. Will not order again. No answers from candy depot to my complaint.I would give it no stars
5.0,Yummy Energy Candy That You Can Easily Carry With You,"Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramel ""drops"" are really more like candy. They are hard and rectangular. The outside candy has a nice caramel taste. The inside is a gooey, liquid and delicious honey. They are really tasty and I found that they did give me a decent amount of energy and did not make me jittery. I tested these drops out on a day when I only had two hours of sleep. I had one drop in the morning and one a few hours later. The only caffeine I had was in the form of some diet tea. They definitely helped me to stay awake.  One package contains 9 ""drops"". While the serving size is 1 piece, three drops equal 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and C. While this may be a great way to get your vitamins and energy, they do have a down side. Each piece contains 5gm of Carbs and 5gm of Sugar. I really hope that they make a sugar free version of these in the future because they are great other than this. The drops are also caffeine free.  Ingredients: Sugar, Corn Syrup, Milk, Honey, Butter, Natural Flavors, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, Vitamin C. **PLEASE NOTE THESE DROPS CONTAIN MILK. IF YOU ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE THEM**  I love that I can toss these into my purse and have something with me that will really give me energy. As long as the carbs and sugar are not an issue for you, I highly recommend them. One pack will last you 3-9 days depending on how often you take them, at the current Amazon price (10/25/11), they are a little over $1.15 for a pack of 9. So, they are also a cheap way to get energy.  PROS: *great price for an energy product *great tasting *they give you a decent amount of energy *you get 100% of your daily value of Vitamins B6, B12 and Vitamin C with 3 drops *highly portable/small *No caffeine or harmful additives *May take care of your sugar fix and give you motivation to get off your booty at the same time :  CONS: *5gm of sugar each drop *5gm of carbs each drop *Hard on your teeth since they are hard candy & sugary"
5.0,Delicious!,"If you like white chocolate you'll love this!  It's not as creamy as a Cafe Escape's hot chocolate k-cup, but add a dash of milk (it's always needed to cool down your beverage anyways) and it's like drinking melted white chocolate!  If you haven't had white chocolate, go buy some and taste it first, it's very different then chocolate.  Based on other reviews I read for this product it seems to me that people bought this without knowing what to expect.  But if you've always been a fan of white chocolate like I am, then this is amazing.  I recommend making a small white chocolate and then adding a k-cup of coffee to make a delicious white mocha like beverage.  Granted it not a white mocha, but it's close enough and probably lower in calories."
1.0,Sand Grinding Teeth,"I really don't like giving such a poor rating, but I feel people should know about this before wasting their good money as I did.  I had noticed sand being mentioned in a review but thought it was not likely to happen.  But, it did. It may be that swallowing small amounts of sand won't hurt you.  But the grinding noise between my teeth tells me there is wear and tear taking place.  And I'm one that does not want to have extra visits to my dentist."
5.0,Great strong coffee!,I really like this coffee. It has a nice flavor and is dark. I like that it comes in three smaller bags as opposed to one large bag because it stays fresher this way - and you could give one as a gift :). I recommend it.
1.0,Definitely NOT hazelnut flavor.,"I have to agree with everyone else. I once accidentally purchased the DaVinci Gourmet brand caramel and I remarked to my husband that it tasted like pancake syrup to me. When I bought this though, I was thrilled to be saving money. Imagine my disappointment then when I tried it the very first time. I believe this is the same syrup as the caramel, but with a different label slapped onto the bottle. No, really I do. I honestly cannot tell the difference between the two.  Well whatever it is, it is NOT hazelnut.  I would recommend the DaVinci Gourmet brand of sugar free Hazelnut OR hazelnut flavored Splenda packets instead. Amazon sells both DaVinci and Splenda, but neither have super saver shipping at the time of this writing. You have to balance for yourself whether or not the extra money is worth it to you."
5.0,Delicious!,"This is the best decaf coffee ever- flavorful, mild, just delicious!  It is hard to find good decaf brands for a pod coffee maker, but this one is a winner."
1.0,Temptations Vomiting,I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
5.0,Please bring back our favorite flavor!,"This is the only hot cereal that my grandson will eat, and it is next to impossible to find. It is also my favorite and I would like to order enough for him to take home, and for me."
1.0,Crumbled Cookies,"Cookies were all crumbled. After we payed a lot of money for them, I would suggest not to wast your money on these cookies."
5.0,Cat's tuna,"I bougth this tuna for my 9 indoor cats. I live in Venezuela and a similar product here costs me twice as much as Chicken of the Sea even after I factor in the Miami-Venezuela freight. But the best thing is that my finicky cats (they refuse tuna in any kind of oil!) loved the stuff! I may have to ""steal"" a can for myself one of these days."
5.0,AMAZING STUFF,Justin's almond butter is by far my favorite product on the market. I put it on almost everything and its vegan!
1.0,Awful,"Awful is the best think i can say about this.  I bought a six pack to try it, thinking it cant be to bad, but I was wrong.  This tasted like carbonated water, not even close to Mt Dew. One star is to high a rating."
1.0,Taste Awful and Waxy Texture,"Not a great chocolate. We have been eating a different brand of dark chocolate for a while, but since we could no longer buy it I thought we would try this dark chocolate. This does not even come close. It tasted awful and had waxy texture. Very disappointed that we cannot return this."
1.0,candy cornMEAL,"this is not candy corn, candycorn meal at best. It was difficult to find even one kernel with all three colors intact. I live in Texas and I have seen candy corn in better condition after being thrown around in a highschool student's trunk all summer. Amazon packed the bags perfectly well. The barcode on one of the bags shows this, as no amount of poor packaging could make the barcode sticker as worn as it was. Seller should describe these as grocery seconds or damaged."
1.0,Beware,"Tried this stuff - and it's truly awful! Far too coarse, too much salt... not to be recommended"
1.0,I really wanted to like this!,"I have never had nori before except in sushi, and I like to try new foods. But this type of food is just too different for my western palate. Neither my wife nor I could try it more than once. It made us sick."
5.0,Chai tea,I love this brand of Chai tea. It is delicious and the cost is completely reasonable.
5.0,Needed it for the Syrups,"Works well for the Torani syrups.. and I bet it'll work for other things as well. If you want to limit the amount of fluid you are using, this is the tool."
1.0,I want to barf.,"I wanted to try making red curry at home since it's delicious. I saw this at the grocery store and was so excited that I bought two bottles. I bought lots of vegetables and good jasmine rice to go with it. As soon as I opened the bottle I tasted a little with my finger. I wanted to be sick. It's sour like sour milk. I was cooking for two other people though so I tried to make the best of it. I added two whole cans of coconut milk, an entire handful of basil and another of cilantro, chicken flavoring, sambal oelek, sugar, salt, anything I thought would help. It ended up edible somehow, but I couldn't eat much because I still had the horrible taste in my mouth. Do not buy this product unless you need to punish yourself for something bad you've done in the past."
1.0,Awful!,This was by far the worst brown rice I have ever eaten. It was mushy and tasteless. I bought a dozen of them on automatic shipments. I am tossing 11 of them away and cancelling the auto delivery.
1.0,I had to spit it out!,"I was so excited to try a cheese-less mac and ""chreeze."" I'm vegan and like just about every kind of food you can think of, but this stuff was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. It didn't taste like cheese all. I added extra rice milk and earth balance to no avail. I took a bite and had to spit it out....and for someone who drinks green drinks and all sorts of concoctions on a daily basis, that says a lot. Steer clear of their mac and chreese and try their gravy instead (it's really good)!"
1.0,Does not dissolve in drinks,"I had great hopes for this product.  Unfortunately, the inulin soluble fiber that is used as ""filler"" does not dissolve in drinks, such as iced tea.  You can try shaking and shaking, but the stuff just won't dissolve.  It reminds me of those snow globes that used to be popular, with the little flecks of white floating down like snow on a pastoral scene.  Letting the drink sit for 2 hours still does not do the trick.  This stuff still can be found at the bottom of your drink.  What's worse is that the manufacturer did not care. I called them to complain, and they simply replied, ""OK, we'll report this to blah blah blah.""  They never bothered to send me a refund, or to offer me coupons for some other product, or ask that I send them samples of the product, like most companies do when you report a complaint with their products."
1.0,What they advertise and what you get,The 10 count they advertise is actually only 6 count. You get 6 boxes of 10 not 10 boxes. It costs less to find it at your local grocery store. I called and got no resolution. The product is great but costs too much to buy from Amazon.
1.0,"ick, ew, yuck, gross","wow-threw this away after one bite.  chemical, sticky sweet smell.  the cereal is translucent. WOW.....I will stick with G-Free Chex. light years better than this."
5.0,Makes most canned tuna taste pathetic in comparison,"This is excellent tuna. I like the 3-ounce cans for carrying in my snack bag or purse - makes a good meal in the car, just add some chips. (Be careful not to spill the oil on your clothes though.)  I like the fact that this tuna does not contain soy or other fillers."
5.0,Yummy!,"I love KIND bars; yummy, relatively few ingredients, gluten free, lower in sugar -- and definitely get a break on the price with the box deal!!"
1.0,confused about this product,"I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows."
5.0,its back,"it taste the same, its sweet,so everything is the same so everyboby get ready lets all ""SMACK IT TO CRACK IT' AND ENJOY."
1.0,not fit for human consumption,These were terrible and horrible --- I ended up giving them to a vegan friend of mine who is a health nut and she liked them.  If you are used to eating food others would consider inedible then these are for you --- if taste is important DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT.
5.0,Great Diabetic Friendly Drink Mix - Highly Recommended,"We like all of the Crystal Light mixes, but find the Raspberry Tea to be the best tasting of all of them. Being diabetic, I am always looking for sugar free products that taste good, but the true test of a product is if my kids will drink it... and they love it.  Highly Recommended!  CFH"
5.0,Addictive Bread,"I first bought this bread at Whole Foods and loved it.  Then, they had a problem with their supplier and week after week had no bread.  I checked on line and found that Amazon had it, at a price lower than Whole Foods.  So I bought a case (12 packages) and am now on my second case.  It is so delicious --I love the chewy whole rye berries and the thin dense slices.  Every morning I eat a slice with either peanut butter or a slice of good cheddar cheese.  One thing I love about it is that it has a shelf life of 6 months or more.  This is because it is pasteurized after being packaged.  Once opened, it is fine for a week.  If your like whole grain breads, try this--you'll love it!"
5.0,Rich & Soothing,"I must admit that this review is written on behalf of my wife. For she is the one who mainly uses it for her brewed ice tea. Because of it's richness and strength it can stand up to added ingredients like sweetner,lemon and yes ice. I like to use it for a soothing hot beverage. Very good product and also a very good price!"
5.0,MY FAVORITE BAI FLAVOR,While I love peach and pear Bai 5 too - blueberry has fast become my favorite!!!  Can't get enough of it!
1.0,Bad product,it is not purple color. The major problem is that it DOES NOT taste like taro at all. It tastes like a generic creamer.
5.0,My Favorite Chicken-flavored Soup,"Gotta disagree with another reviewer. I have tried dozens of chicken soups over the years and this is one of my faves. But it all comes down to personal taste, doesn't it?"
5.0,Good coffee,"I am really enjoying this coffee. Its as easy as doing an smell test with another premium bean. They look, smell and taste amazing. I plan to buy again in the future!"
1.0,Very Disappointed!,"I should have known that there was something fishy when the product details said that the product dimensions are 13 x 10.5 x 2.5 inches and 3.8 pounds when the shipping weight said 2.15 pounds.  In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale.  However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood.  In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.  There are no hinges on the back.  I am very disappointed with this tea ""chest"" AND it's price!"
1.0,Disappointed,"Lipton Black Tea, Black Pearl Pure Long Leaf, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6 I originally purchased this tea from the grocery store. When I saw them here I thought that it was a great price. This tea is not as strong as the original one that I purchased in the store.  It appears to be weaker in taste, I have to use 2 teabags from this box in order to get the same flavor as the ones that I originally purchased from the grocery store."
1.0,Can definitely tasted the hydrogenated soybean oil in the lemon meringue flavor - BLUCK!,The lemon meringe pudding is awful.  Tastes very plastic and like what it's made of - hydrogenated soybean oil.  Very big disappointment - BLUCK!!  Love the vanilla flavor - so don't know what happened with this flavor.
5.0,firm and tasty...YUM!!,"I bought mine at Whole Foods.  If you've tasted Reese's, then you won't be disappointed.  Usually when I buy organic, the taste isn't really that great, but Justin's was even better than Newman's (which is like almost liquidy dripping -not that tasty- peanut butter coming out of a melting chocolate shell.)  Justin's is a firmer tasty peanut butter filling in a firm tasty chocolate shell.  It's organic, vegan so a better alternative to Reese's but still tasty."
1.0,causes a burning sensation,"I am been using the ""standard"" Degree Deodorant for years and have been really happy with it. Recently I tried the Silver Ion version and found that it caused some burning on my skin. I needed to wash it off. I experienced this some years ago when the Old Spice deordorant that I was using changed to a ""new and improved"" version. Back then I needed to switch to another brand. I hope that Degree keeps their ""standard"" deodorant on the store shelves. For reference, there seems to be a product warning:  ""For external use only. Do not use on broken skin. Stop use if rash or irritation occurs.""  For Silver Ion this applies to me. Hopefully not to you"
5.0,PET FOOD RECALL WORRIES?  NO PROBLEM WITH NEWMAN'S!,"Upon the initial pet food recall news, I immediately began my investigation into the healthiest food choices for my pets.  Although I am already diligent as a pet parent of eight, and none of the foods we use were recalled, I still felt I wanted to go even MORE natural.  In doing this research, I found out that not only does Newman's company make salad dressing, as we all know, but ALSO a VAST variety of human and pet treats as well! :)  I got a great deal through Amazon on this pack of six bags, so I got two flavors and sizes for my dogs.  They are ALL natural, and when you touch them yourself and feel the texture, and see the actual oats and cheese or whatnot for yourself, you will be so happy you are feeding them to your pet instead of crap food.  People have no idea just how awful most name brand pet food is and that it is really like the equivalent of feeding junk food to their kids for every meal.  But it's not our faults when pet food companies are abusing our trust.  Get these treats.  You and your pets will be healthier for it . . . physically, mentally, spiritually."
5.0,Great product,Great product.  Great packaging.  I would definietly recommend this product for all casual home bakers.  Easy to use and store.
1.0,"NOT ""SWEET"" potato!!! NOT what is shown!","This item is NOT as shown! NO ""sweet potatoes"" were used in the making of this product!!  What is shown on the box is ""Sweet Potato Pancakes"". ""Sweet potato"" means sweet potatoes or yams. I believed I was ordering a pancake mix made with SWEET potatoes.  What I got is - the box is identical in appearance EXCEPT - it says ""SWEETENED Potato Pancakes""!  BIG DIFFERENCE! Absolutely NO ""sweet potatoes"" were used in the making of this product!  I am EXTREMELY disappointed. If I could give it ""0"" stars I would. Will not order it again!!"
1.0,buyer,i dont like this tea.i will not buy it agine because it dont test right.dont think i will use it so it is a wast of money
1.0,Tastes really bad,"I love miso soup and was shocked that this soup was so bad.  The smell alone was enough to make me want to dump it out.  I can't put my finger on what exactly was so bad about it, but after making one cup I threw the box away."
1.0,Good luck with this!,"Terrible product! After 3 days of messing with it, I can't even get the thing to stay cocked. Watched the videos, read the excellent reviews, etc. Still can't get the thing to stay cocked-just releases itself before you can even get to the safety latch. Never even got close to putting them in the ground-I bought 3 of them and now I get to pay the shipping back. By the time I box them up, take them to shipping just to get the remainder of my money back-might as well just throw them away and save the aggravation. Go for it if you feel lucky."
5.0,Very Authentic Taste,"I agree with the review above. It's really difficult to find this type of authentic flavor in the US. This box is ready to cook and is super easy to work with. I like to use two boxes, throw my own fresh meat/veggies in it. The results are restaurant quality. I will be trying the rest of the Prima Taste Curries now."
1.0,overpriced item,Price of saffron from Valencia Spain is $75.00 US/oz retail in Palm Beach Gourmet market for Dec. 2007.
1.0,Horrible flavor made my infant vomit causing setback in recovery,"Our 11 month old son had a bad, week-long stomach flu and had stopped taking the plain Pedialyte once he was able to start drinking formula again, but because he still had diarrhea he needed some Pedialyte. So I tried giving him this fruit flavor. He had a few sips via spoon and spewed projectile vomit twice. This is after having not vomited in over 24 hours. It put us back to square one. Smell and taste it yourself, it's awful. Maybe older kids prefer it, who knows, but I will never give this product to my child ever again."
5.0,Extremely Poor Amazon packaging/ great product,"Receive several dented cans - I have ordered this product several times.  It is wonderful to be used in animal diets.  I have been working with animals and it has been a life saver for many animals that I have helped I believe that it would be unfair to fault the product or the manufacturer.  From what I understand from the UPS driver, it Amazon who is at fault for extremely  poor packaging practices.  For some strange reason Amazon seems to be very cheap with its use of packing tape as well as internal packing."
1.0,half of them were spoiled,"The good ones were good, but when half of them are spoiled you loose you taste for bad pistachios.  Even the good ones had too strong of some kind of flavor.  I found a better place to buy them."
1.0,Way too sweet.  Health claims are as empty as its calories.,"This is just too sweet for me.  Cloying.  It's OK if you dilute it about half and half with plain seltzer.  And an 8.3 ounce can of this has as many calories as a twelve ounce Coke!  I don't buy the line that sweetness from juice is healthier than sweetness from high fructose corn syrup.  As far as my digestion is concerned, one sugar molecule is like another.  The can even boasts that the drink is gluten free!  Oh no - I guess that means it isn't whole grain. :-)  I won't be buying this stuff."
5.0,THE BOMB,We love these salsas. They are roasted salsas with bits of burnt pieces that set this flavor off! The medium red is perfect for dipping with the right amount of heat. We will definetely buy again.
5.0,Best salad dressing ever,"Heinz Salad Cream has the most divine slightly sweet, slightly mustardy flavor.  Tomatoes don't taste the same without it.  It's also great on green salad and green vegetables such as broccoli.  This is a childhood favorite of mine and very difficult to obtain in the US - but I'm hooked!"
1.0,Another evil junk food item,"I was so excited to try these out but the obscene amounts of sugar shocked me out of my delight. Does a nut bar really need 5 different sweeteners? There's the bane of my existence - corn syrup, followed by sugar, evaporated cane juice invert syrup, honey and brown sugar on top of that, excuse me Planters but why are you poisoning us with this? These bars are so sweet that my cavity was singing the day I tried them, I mean blaring pain and the bar itself isn't so spectacular, the nuts are mostly chopped up into random pieces with sweet syrup on top and some sort of bread crumb like stuffing in between.  I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy and I would advise to stay far away from these. Corn syrup is packed into 90% of processed foods; even jarred pickles have this stuff in the sauce they swim in, I feel like a science project when I get anything that isn't raw these days, and this is another bad, shameful product that people will eat for sure and pay for it with their poor health twenty years later. Cheap food is expensive, it makes us sick later, and this is yet another product to add to this problem.  - Kasia S."
5.0,Bali's Best Coffee Candy,I received a small jar of Bali's Best Coffee for Christmas.  Just had to have more and could not find it in stores.  Amazon offered the best online deal for this item.  I have now purchased a second case (4 to a case).  Just love it!
1.0,Coconut???,"Why did they have to add coconut to these snack bars?  They would have been great without the coconut.  And now I find out I can't return them, and I'm stuck with them.  If you want them, let me know - I'll trade you for some decent granola bars."
5.0,Great cup of coffee you carry in your pocket,We first tried this in Italy and loved it.  Great for those cold days on the mountain or anytime you need an energy boost.
1.0,Special K Protein Plus ruined with added sugar!,Idiots!  Why destroy the health benefits of one of the best breakfast cereals on the market by adding sugar to it??!!  They might as well have added more salt while they were at it! I'm sure that would have made the cereal taste better too. I don't know anyone who is happy with the new Special K Protein Plus recipe. They need to restore the original!  Until then they have lost my business.
5.0,I feel at peace with the world when I drink this Zen Tea......,"Tazo has done it again, folks.  When they concocted Zen, they definitely knew what they were doing.  For starters, this isn't your abuela's green tea.  Zen has notes of ingredients that include exotic green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint and natural flavor.  I especially took note of the spearmint, upon sipping it for the first time.  It's invigorating and dances on your tongue.  You can drink Zen with (or without) honey.  It's really your preference.  The tea tastes great on its own, but honey adds a great note of sweetness to this wonderful blend of herbal and green tea.  This is one habit you don't need to worry about breaking.  If you are ever feeling stressed out, make a date with yourself and set five minutes aside to sip this lovely beverage.  You won't be sorry."
5.0,Love these beans!,I use to buy these in the the store and then for some reason they stopped carrying them. I found them on Amazon and was like THANK YOU!!! They cook up great and not like the nasty taste of canned refried beans. i have tried sooo many brands and this hands-down has been the tops!
1.0,Worst taste ever!,"This detox tea tastes so bad that I had to force it down! I thought that it would be a good thing to do a natural detox, but I could hardly get through one box, and had to gulp it down quickly to try to not taste or smell it. It also stained my teeth! I would NEVER take this tea again!"
5.0,GOOD,ALWAYS... ORDER THIS....ORDERED 2 ONLY GOT ONE... PLEASE SEND BACK ORDER...MY DOGS LOVE THEM!
5.0,A Tasty Reminder of Childhood,"My mother was a good cook, but she hated to actually cook at all. If something was available as ""instant"" or as a mix, we were unlikely to ever see it again made from scratch. But for one recipe, we didn't mind at all and that was gingerbread. Mother always bought Dromedary Gingerbread Mix and it was delicous back then and it still tastes great today.  It had become impossible to find the Dromedary mixes here locally so I was delighted to find that it was still being made and even an Amazon Prime eligible product at a decent price. While six boxes sounds like a lot, I recently ordered another six and sent an order to my virtually noncooking sister. It is really addictive stuff and it is virtually foolproof to make. All you need to add is one cup of water and you can even mix it directly in the baking pan with no need to even dirty a bowl.  The recipe is said to be based on our very first First Lady Martha Washington's recipe for gingerbread, but whoever created it, it comes out dark, moist and perfectly spiced. We often took this mix on camping trips and baked it on the coals in a cast iron Dutch oven on top of canned applesauce. At home, I sometimes make lemon curd to serve over the slices while my sister loves to eat it hot with butter.  If you like gingerbread, you will love the convenience of this mix. If you are capable of setting an oven temperature, measuring one cup of water and stirring and can tell time, it will come out great, just as it did for my Mother decades ago. Why are you still reading this when you could be clicking on the ""Order Now"" button?"
5.0,Kato and Dexter approved,"I tried expensive wet cat foods to include EVO which is the dry cat food we use, but my cats gave me dirty looks and refused to eat it.  We tried at least 15 kids of wet cat food over the past couple of years and even tried feeding the cats straight fish, but when we'd set anything new down in front of them, they would look at it and band together in a hunger strike.  I would have fed them something more expensive if they would have eatten it, but this is what they want to eat.  I give up.  This is my cats' food forever."
5.0,make your own smartfood popcorn,"Love this flavoring--all of them are actually pretty good. I sprinkle it on regular foods as well--not just popcorn. It is just salty and cheesy enough for a delicious treat. Also, the bottles last forever because a little goes a long long way! Enjoy :)"
1.0,cider k-cups,"Wasn't pleased with it. It contains aspartime, which I can't use. It didn't say when ordering it. I plan on returning them.."
1.0,Like no peach I have ever tasted,Peaches are beyond crisp. Had to poach them for ten minutes in order to use them in peach melba. Taste more like an unripe pear.
5.0,Good Stuff,"It is quite a struggle to get my 2 year old daughter to eat healthy foods. This stuff really helps to fill the nutrition gap. She calls them her ""mango squeezies""."
1.0,Displeased with product,"As a Native American who is from Seattle, I was excited to try this well-reviewed product. It is a great disappointment. There were about 3 ounces of liquid as part of the weight for which we paid so dearly. The flavor was watery and fishy with a faintly salty hint of smokiness. Did I receive a bad batch? Whatever shall we do with the additional unopened package? It was intended as a gift... Maybe I will give it to the cats for Christmas."
5.0,A pleasant surprise!,"I developed a dairy sensitivity about 10 years ago and have been searching for a non-dairy alternative to milk for 10 years.  I first settled on soy milk, but recently developed a sensitivity to soy as well.  For the past year, I've been sampling the various dairy alternatives and haven't been overly impressed with any of them.  I recently heard about Good Karma's Rice Milk and decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised. The consistency is better than the other rice milks I've tried.  No, it doesn't have the same consistency as milk, but it's far less ""watery"" than other rice milks I've sampled.  The flavor is pleasant and mild (i.e., not overly sweet, like some other products on the market).  Pair good consistency and flavor with the fact that it's organic and whole grain, and you've got one happy customer!  Also, to note, I just noticed this company offers a flax milk.  I'm anxious to try that product as well!"
5.0,GREAT DOG FOOD,I have to buy this dog food for my Dashound because of allergies to food. This is the only dry dog food I have been able to find that will not cause him to break out with bumps. Beside he loves it. I will continue to buy this as long as I can find it.  He has had no adverse reactions since being on the this food. It is better than the stuff the vet was selling me for allergy's.
1.0,YUK!,I am obsessed with kale chip lately so I thought I would try these. They were inedible. I was so dissapointed. I could do wonderous things with Kale Chips but apparently Kaia missed the mark. What I didn't know when I ordered them is that they were topped with what tasted like bird seeds. I tried to give the bag away to several visitors but no one would take them!!! They left a terrible taste in my mouth. The only good thing is that they sent me a free apple fruit roll like they knew they had to make up for the chips.
1.0,Advice to more than 1 star reviewers,"I guess my mistake was trying Harney and Sons Cinnamon Spice Tea before I tried this.  Compared to Harney and Sons this has no aroma and is bland, bland, bland.  Try Harney's!"
1.0,Don't bother,Did not ship well. Returned and had 3 more reshipped. Two out of three were once again opened and contents spilled all over. My cats don't like it nearly as much as what I can pick up for less at WalMart. Was seriously disappointed.
5.0,Yum!,These were delivered quickly and are delicious.  Highly recommend this for anyone with a weakness for chocolate covered cherries.  Yum!
1.0,better off with a gatorade and a vitamin pill,"tastes awful only provides about 10% of some vitamins 63 calories deceptive nutrition label [bottle contains ""1.25 servings"" give me a break]  wle."
1.0,Tastes nothing like you would hope or expect.,"I rarely type reviews but simply have to after trying this product. I picked it up at Whole Foods and yes, the color is kinda strange, but I can get past that. And I realized it wouldn't taste truly like ice cream. But it has such a sickeningly sweet flavor that is nothing like cookies and cream. It reminded me of cheap ice milk with a bunch of Equal packets mixed in. And I did assume there would be 'cookies'. I know that there are whey crisps out on the market and assumed that something similar would be used.  Overall, I really hated this product and after trying to doctor it up, I just threw it away. It's not a remotely good ice cream substitute. If you're looking for a natural, low sugar option, try So Delicious No-Sugar Added Coconut Milk Ice Cream. I've tried the Mint Chip and Chocolate and both are pretty delicious."
1.0,Not worth the money,I had heard about this product on the local news and decided to try this product. It was the worse product I have ever eaten.  I could not finish it and I am stuck with another bag of this item.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. It also took a long time to arrive...........
1.0,thought it was a good deal but...,"...the order was not what was shown. I tried contacting the company to see what happened and got nothing. I only got 1/2 an order of half caff and then the rest of my Kcups were MISC decaf flavors...which is NOT what I paid for. Too much time, effort, and $ to send it back and deal with it so we kept them. Won't EVER buy from this company again. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because there was no option for zero. Buyer beware!"
1.0,Not Worth the Price I Paid,"These were definitely not worth the price, and I only paid a little over eight dollars. These bags are incredibly tiny, and there really are a few tiny bears in each bag. I wish the product description provided the number of ounces per package so I could better judge how much product I was getting. The total product received is comparable to approximately two regular sized bags of gummy bears that you would buy in the candy aisle at the grocery store. I was shocked at how little I received for the price."
5.0,Good staple mix,"I order these by the case every month.  I use my bread machine a few times a week, mostly from scratch but when time is tight we use this mix.  My kids love it!"
5.0,There are a great gluten free snack!,"My daughter does not always want to eat the ""same ol' same ol' "" in her lunch bag and was looking for a cracker of some sort to have at snack time. Being a Celiac patient at 7 years old cannot be easy--but we try to always find something to substitute so she will not feel different from her peers. These are a great snack for her to have! Since we are also a healthy eating family I try and keep away from most overly processed snacks and I feel these are a pretty good comprises to crackers or her cheese stick standby. I will be trying the other flavors now!"
1.0,Gross!,"This mix is just awful.  No matter what, it will not fully dissolve.  Even after the most vigorous shake, I'll still see clumps at the bottom and big particles floating throughout the bottle.  To make matters worse, it has a sickening taste - literally!  I started to feel sick almost immediately after drinking a bit - the artificial flavoring is truly overwhelming.  And this is coming from someone who relies heavily on artificial sweeteners, so it's not like I'm new to these things.  Definitely not worth buying; I much prefer Crystal Light."
5.0,Dove dark chocolates,My Dove dark chocolate promises arrived perfect.  No melting and they were yummy.  Now I am out and need more. They arrived exactly as promised and I would order them again.
1.0,Taste terrible,I tried these because of a low carb diet. They are really awful! Not only did they not taste right from the start but there is the worst after taste. Try making your own. Deli chaddar cheese cut up into little squares bake at 400 for 7 minutes. Line you pan with parchment. You can add as much or as little salt as you want. I also add crushed red pepper for some spice.
5.0,Good stuff,"Used to buy this locally, but now none of the stores carry it.  So, I started ordering it online.  It makes a great cup of cocoa if you like hazelnut flavor and it dissolved readily in hot milk.  A teaspoon added to a cup of coffee adds a nice accent, too."
1.0,It is misleading advertising .,"I was sure for the price I paid I will get 30 think thin bars. Instead I got 20 bars and 10 worthless think thin bites that I will not pay a penny for them. Very disappointed . Your advertising,  if your read it carefully it is at best misleading."
5.0,Greenies for cats,"never mind what I think. Ms. Ruby loves them. She's the expert. I just follow behind with the money, which is a great price, by the way..."
1.0,SCAM,The label on-line clearly shows the ingredients as being strictly dates.  But the syrup arrived and the label is completely different.  The item includes SUGAR!! Hello!?!  What is the point of that? Date syrup is supposed to be an alternative to sugar.  I think it is ridiculous Amazon lets this happen.  And because it is a grocery item I cannot return it.  What a waste.
5.0,Best K-Cup Coffee Yet,"I really like this flavor, it is really smooth and light, but not weak tasting... perfect morning coffee when you want to gulp down a cup of Joe..."
1.0,Yucky!!!,I suffered through an order of this stuff before I wised up and switched to another brand.  This coconut water has a really off taste - sour or spoiled.  It definitely did not taste like the coconut water I was accustomed to.  I switched to Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water.  What a difference!  Save your money and spare your taste buds and skip this product.
5.0,Delicious!,"These are excellent tortilla chips -- crispy, thin, very nicely flavored.  I especially love the lime and chili flavor, but they are all great.  Will definitely buy again!"
5.0,Good Soda Alternative,"In my effort to rid my all-American diet of high fructose corn syrup (found in almost all major sodas sold in the States, and everything else), I've been buying San Pellegrino sparkling drinks for about six months now. I'm very partial to this orange flavor as well as the  blood orange flavor  as they're not as bitter as the lemon flavor, and still satisfy the craving I occasionally get for something sweet. I might also add for the benefit of my Jewish friends: the drinks are kosher.  Admittedly, it's not the healthiest thing to drink - there's still a ton of sugar (though it also advertises that it's made up of 16% orange juice), but if you're going to choose a sugar-laden drink, better it be this than a can of high fructose corn syrup.  It's pretty tasty alone, but a bit of vodka or rum works well with it too."
5.0,Great for making your own sprouts,"This is an awesome kit for making your own sprouts.  I've made three batches, and they are all great - excited to try more than just alfalfa!"
5.0,"Very strong, pure cacao.","I use this cacao powder in my coffee in the mornings. I have to be careful not to use too much or it won't dissolve, but otherwise it works and tastes great. I have also used it in place of regular cocoa for baking brownies and they turned out very rich and chocolatey. This is definitely not the same as Hershey's cocoa powder- not for the faint of heart. Also very rich in nutrients like iron and magnesium, which is why I switched."
5.0,Superior chocolate,"Dagoba chocolates are all high quality, but this bar is one of my favorites (along with lavender and xocolatl). The rose flavor is distinctive, but not overwhelmingly floral; the raspberry component comes through more strongly. The cocoa content also makes this a good chocolate if you want to eat a little at a time. I'm less tempted to eat the whole bar at a sitting when each bite is so flavorful and satisfying.  Amazon's prices are better than you'll find most places, too -- the stores where I've been able to find this brand charge $3 or so per bar, and so does Dagoba's own website (and then there's shipping...)."
5.0,New way to get old product,"We used to purchase this companies Orange Cappacinno Coffee until they stopped making it.  We have now found that by mixing one can of the Orange coffee with one can of the traditional Cappaccino Coffee we get very close to the original product that we love.  Unfortunatley, our local stores do not carry this flavor - but Amazon.Com to the rescue."
5.0,Anna Long Fusilli,This is one of my families favorite macaroni and have found it diffcult to find in Oklahoma. I still follow the family tradition of  serving gravy (sauce) and macaroni (pasta) on Sunday.  This is even great as a leftover for a lunch pasta salad.
1.0,Ugh!,"Just tried this in my Keurig Mini and it is awful.  I wanted to use only 5-6 oz. of water, but the Mini insists that you use 8 oz., therefore the chocolate was watery with very little chocolate flavor.  I'll stick to milk mixed with Midnight Moo from Trader Joe's or a hot chocolate powder like Ghiradelli."
1.0,Horrible!,"This was really a disappointment. I tried to make a simple pie crust with it, and it smelled and tasted so chemical I had to throw it away. No idea why it tasted so bad, but I can not believe how bad it is. So I recommend you use Almond flour or something else."
5.0,Pflaumenmus!,"I'm crazy about Pflaumenmus, plum jam, the way they make it in different parts of Germany with slightly differing flavors. My favorite is M&uuml;hlh&auml;user from Thuringia. The Schwartau was the only one available through amazon.com the time my supply from a store in Phoenix (Old Heidelberg Bakery on Indian School Road)ran out. This product comes from a town near L&uuml;beck in northern Germany. I use it as a bread spread. I rate the product ""excellent"". Of all the plum jams I have tasted this one stands out with a very unique flavor; unfortunately I can't describe the spice(s) that gave it this flavor (I don't cook or bake). What comes to my mind is Christmas and a touch of campfire smoke. I'm glad I ordered it. It's heavy, and shipping for 4 jars was 35% of the total. But one expects to pay more for specialty items...."
5.0,Wow!,"Back when I was a destitute college student, I and a fellow student worked together would share canned soup and rice meals to save money. He was from India, and he had these fantastic spicy pickles that would jazz up our otherwise bland meals.  I've searched for those pickles for 20 years and I think I've finally found them--hot mango relish!  If you like a little spice, then you will love this relish for making your meals have more kick. It has a lot of chile powder, so it is very similar to a Chinese chile sauce, except that it has chunks of mango fruit as well. Yow! My mouth is still burning! I love it!"
1.0,didn't catch any roaches,"We used these traps in my house and didn't catch any roaches. In fact, we ended up catching a mouse instead.. it was pretty horrifying. The mouse was screeching really loudly and it just seemed pretty awful. Sadly, we didn't catch any roaches."
1.0,Expired,"The first time I got these, everything was great. The second time, however, the sticks tasted a bit off... then I notice the 3-months-expired date on them."
5.0,Another great Walden Farms dressing,"This is another great dressing from Walden Farms. It's calorie-free but has great taste. As a warning, I should note that it's vinegar-based (not cream-based), so if you don't like vinegar, you might not have the same liking for this dressing that I do, but I am definitely hooked on this and other Walden Farms dressings."
5.0,Best Chipotle Sauce Hands Down,"I use this on burgers, in chili, on chicken, it is Great! Not too hot, but yet hot enough with a great taste that you cannot get enough of."
1.0,Der off repellent,"Deer Off deer, rabbit and squirrel repellent may actually repel deer if you can get the repellent on the plants. I carefully followed the dilution instructions, poured the mixture into a sprayer, and started to use it. Within a few minutes the sprayer was clogged. I ended up putting the mixture into a sprinkling can and sprinkling it on the plants -- a very inefficient way to use it. I tried to clean the sprayer and finally had to throw it away. It was a sprayer I had used successfully with other sprays. I would not buy this product again."
5.0,Best White Tea I've had,"Triple leaf makes the best white tea hands down. I swear this stuff cures me of any cold or flu (just drink a few cups a day when you start to feel something coming on). Also, I read studies that show white tea fights cavities, well guess what... I went to Dentist and had my teeth cleaned and they kept commenting on my clean teeth and how there was hardly any work for them. I'm a clean person but I dont have a great history of strong teeth. So, I was happy about that. Also, even if you dont buy Triple Leaf, just drink White Tea, ANy white tea! It has so much more in antioxidants than green tea and I know my brain function as well as health is better when I drink it daily. It also has been shown to kill bacteria such as MRSA and strep upon contact. I'm not saying if you have MRSA bathe in it, although I probably would to test it, but this is an awesome little tea!  Oh yeah, Triple Leaf, I like triple leaf because of the taste, it has a sweeter taste than most white teas. You can find the tooth and bacteria info by looking up past research studies on Sciencedaily. Look at past 10years."
5.0,Gourmet Hot Cereal,"I grew up eating this delicious hot cereal for breakfast. It is made of whole wheat with a little malt added. It's much tastier than cream of wheat which is made with bleached white flour. For those trying to limit their intake of refined carbs, it's an excellent choice. It is especially good with a mix of nuts and yogurt on top."
1.0,oberto is bud sellar,"I cannot write my review about harina pan I oredered on this Aug from japan, the sellar Oberito is worst 1 sellar in my buying experiences, please take Oberito off from amazon, be carefle this sellar now maybe imitate their sellar name from Oberito. Amazon should trace or check their IP address, bank account, etc, or inform to Police."
1.0,NO SEEDS!!!,"Gave plant to my mother for X-mas and nothing grew, she took it apart and NO SEED, none at all! I cant sent it back because I dont have the original packing slip, my mother is very disapointed and I'd buy her another one but I dont want the same thing to happen! :("
5.0,Very Good!,"This is really good! I mixed mine with half regular coffee (I don't want to go into withdrawals)!! I discovered that I can drink this without creamer, which is nice because I am allergic to dairy and powdered creamers are just chemicals. Almond milk wasn't that great either. This is smooth, and the vanilla taste is like a gourmet coffee shop."
1.0,"Love the Coffee, Hate the Package","My mom and I have been drinking this coffee for years and absolutely love it.  It is well-priced, tastes great, and it's easy to keep in the office to make at work - not to mention way less money than heading to a coffee shop.  BUT, I really hate the new packet format.  First of all, one packet really isn't enough for me for a good cup.  Second, they are annoying to open.  And most importantly, these are the opposite of environmentally friendly.  Why do we need all the excess packaging?  Bring back the canisters!"
5.0,MY FAVORITE CHEWING GUM,"WRIGLEYS FREEDENT WINTERFRESH GUM, IS ABSOLUTELY THE VERY BEST CHEWING GUM. WRIGLEYS IS APPARENTLY PHASING OUT THIS PARTICULAR FLAVOR. I LOOK FOR THIS GUM IN EVERY STORE I GO INTO WITHOUT ANY LUCK. SOMEONE MENTIONED LOOKING FOR THE GUM AT AMAZON. LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THAT  AMAZON WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY ME WITH THE  GUM. I BOUGHT 2 BOXES. BUT THE SHIPPING WAS SO EXPENSIVE THAT I WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO CHANGE MY FLAVOR BECAUSE THE SHIPPING COST 1/3 OF THE COST OF THE GUM."
1.0,BEWARE OF CAFFEINE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO AVOID!,"This product tastes pretty good, although I would not call it thirst-quenching. But, if you think you're drinking a holistic refreshment in lieu of a caffeinated beverage, you are not. The caffeine content is about 25 mg/8 ounces (20 ounces per bottle), so you are getting as much caffeine as a cup of coffee! If you think the natural ingredients and B complex are giving you an energy boost, it's probably the caffeine. Me and my heart arrhythmia didn't appreciate being duped. Sobe should label this product to include the fact that it contains caffeine on the front of the label, not on the very, very bottom under the ingredients."
5.0,Twizzlers - Strawberry,"Product received is as advertised.   Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6) "
5.0,Michigan's Best,"Our favorite thing in Michigan is the cherries.  We purchased some dried cherries this summer, as gifts and they were delicious.  These Traverse Bay Dried Cherries taste just as great as the ones purchased this summer but we're keeping them all to ourselves!  They are great on hot cereal and in cookies or just for a snack."
1.0,Horrible Taste,"This product tasted horrible and I would not recommend to anyone ever. It says cherry-mint, it should say toothpaste.  If you want water that tastes good and better than this drink water."
1.0,Disappointing Flavor,"Having been a faithful drinker of Trader Joe's cranberry green tea, I was disappointed when they discontinued carrying it. I then decided to try Twinings' cranberry green tea. Big mistake. There is absolutely no comparison. While Twinings' green tea has a pleasant scent, the pleasure ends there. The taste leaves a whole lot to be desired. I would not recommend this tea to anyone. Drink at your own risk."
1.0,The worst crackers ever,"I tried to order Sesmark rice crackers, but they were out so Amazon suggested me this brand instead, they are tasteless and terrible.  I would not take them even if they are for free."
5.0,Kat,This tea is excellent. I expected a great tea and I got one with this product.  It is flavorful but no flaver overpowered another and I like the fact that it is organic. It is really good iced with a little sweetener or your choice and milk.
1.0,OVERPRICED!!!,"I LOVE Shirataki noodles...but Miracle Noodles are SO overpriced. $ [...] bags! Asianfoodgrocer.com sells 24 bags of the same noodles (White Shirataki) for $[...]. Don't buy these, its a rip off!"
1.0,Not enough to do the job,"It is OK, but is not really strong enough to do the job of flavoring your coffee. It takes a lot of this item to make any difference at all."
5.0,These worked out great,"I was really worried about buying flowers from Falcon Farms as most customer reviews were either 5 star or 1 star without almost any in the middle.  So I had assumed that customer reviews were terrible but that maybe the manufacturer posted great reviews to counteract the bad ones.  It's hard to tell.  Well, according to my sister-in-law the flowers look great and they arrived within two days of ordering them."
5.0,"Petguard is a high-quality, pure, nutrient-dense pet food","Petguard is one of the main brands of food I feed to my pets.  I love it because it is wheat-free, corn-free, and free of all fillers and junky ingredients.  It contains high-quality protein and other nutrients.  It is one of the few brands of pet food out there that I feel really good about feeding to my animals.  I highly recommend it."
1.0,Faulty packaging - unusable,Lift mechanism to deliver deodorant to top for application to the skin is broken on both containers. This renders it useless. I will not purchase this packaging again.
1.0,WRONG!!!! NOT what I expected and NOT what I wanted!!!!,"What the heck??? I'm so disappointed! I DID NOT receive what I expected! I expected GINGER PEOPLE ORIGINAL GINGER CHEWS, long rectangles w/ the fine powdered sugar INDIVIDUALLY wrapped in the green wrappers, (gee, just like the picture, imagine that!). Instead what I received was a clear bag w/ a generic homemade typed up label. Inside are square candies with coarse sugar crystals on them. What a mess! I live in TX, this is going to clump up into one giant piece of candied ginger. I wanted the INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED ones LIKE IN THE PICTURE to have in my purse. I'm looking into returning this mess!"
5.0,Best Price,"For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness."
1.0,"Flawless espresso, flawed delivery","The iperEspresso system is the best yet in terms of automating and simplifying espresso. No surprise, welcome to Illy. They created a perfect method of getting the exact amount of espresso coffee into a machine, with a minimum amount of mess, that consistently produces an excellent pull. The only control that the operator has is the one that they would want, that is the amount of espresso produced.  The problem stems from the way the capsules are packaged and delivered. For some reason, Illy chose a cheap-ass can that is pressurized with an inert gas. That causes the lid not to fit right until after the inner seal is pulled. Once you do that, the same lid loosely fits over the now air-exposed capsules. This makes absolutely no sense give that other capsule manufacturers go to great lengths to keep individual capsules sealed until ready for use. Why Illy did not consult with Lavazza on how to accomplish this relatively simple task is beyond me. Then you have the bulky can to dispose of when the capsules are gone.  Why the '1'? Just to draw attention to this review. Anyone who has had a cup of espresso made with an iperEspresso machine will be shocked because it is indeed the best espresso possible, a barista can do no better with a $10,000 Gaggia. Maybe Illy will listen and fix the problem."
5.0,Good stuff,This is a vital ingredient in my BBQ sauce. Great flavor and consistency at a good value. Thank you for a great deal on some wonderful product.
1.0,"cause allergy, bad for poodle","a mistake i won't repeat ever again.  after switching to this, my pooch began to lick his paws and i never realize he was allergic to it."
1.0,Shattered,"Broken into 50 pieces when it arrived.  Ruined.  Had to try to glue it together, and then ultimately get another one."
5.0,Great gift for the money,"My brother and sister in law said the contents were fun and delicious. Great gift for the money, and with people dropping by for New Years, I am thinking of ordering one for myself. Good job. I would recommend"
5.0,YUMMM,Great taste.  Fresh.  Would not suggest as a breakfast food.  Learned that the hard way.
1.0,What???!!! One Sprout in a Month???,"I started my first Aero Garden with great success; it gave me more herbs than I could keep up with. However, when I ordered this International Basil seed kit, despite following the re-plant instructions to the letter, after about a month, I have just one basil sprout, approximately 3 cm above the label. The package says they're ""guaranteed to grow"" but says nothing about how to redeem that guarantee if they don't grow. Now I've spent over $20 on something that didn't even work. What a waste!"
5.0,Douwe Egbert coffee,Excellent coffee.  My husband had it at a restaurant in Arkansas and we had to order it as soon as we got home.  Other people in the restaurant were talking about how good it was.
1.0,This was disappointing.,"I love tea...and I really hate writing bad reviews. Maybe I didn't make it right, but I've made other teas that came out just fine. I've bought a bottled version of it from another brand and expected a similar taste out of this tea I bought today. I tasted nothing. I let it steep and steep and steep, taking sips ever so often to see if the flavor ever came out.  I think the most disappointing thing about it is its box and smell. It's box describes it as ""pomegranate blueberry"" flavor. I tasted neither. It had such a seductive aroma, so much so, I could smell it while it was still packaged and I admit it was what persuaded me to buy it.  I let my mother try it, and she described it perfectly:  even though it had a lovely aroma, it wasn't flavoring the water. I noticed that there was an ""apple-y"" after taste at least. Lipton's just needs to step it up and make it a bit stronger so you can actually taste it. I don't know if it is because I have a natural affinity for stronger tea, or what, but I cannot begin with how disappointed I was, especially for the price I paid in store. If a tea has a fruit flavor added, I want to taste the fruit. I would rather it have a robust, full-bodied flavor. Or at least put on the label that it's a milder tea.  For the rest of the people who put excellent reviews, do tell what you did to make it taste so good. I find that it is sweet smelling water and nothing more."
5.0,Very good,"Has a pleasant, light, crisp, slightly sweet taste.  I used it in ice tea and it is quite refreshing."
5.0,Great product!,"I love this product and use it for everything not just pancakes! It does not have a nasty Gluten-free taste like other products i have tried. I received it before it said it would arrive, so the shipping was fast."
1.0,false advertising--bad brew,Starbucks has done away with its delicious mild Breakfast Blend and instead the newly packaged Medium Breakfast Blend is bitter with a terrible burnt aftertaste. Yuck!
5.0,Best Chew Toy I've found,"I don't write reviews very often -- only if I'm either very thrilled with a product or very disappointed.  In this case, I'm thrilled! :)  We just got two German Shepherd puppies -- and have tried numerous chewtoys, Kongs, etc -- but the Busy Buddy is the favorite!  I found that the pups like the rough rawhide rings better than the smooth ones... but they just chew the rough ones first & then go for the smooth.  This bone keeps them occupied for quite a while -- and they'll keep gnawing at it to get the last little bit of the ring off.  I found it lasts longer if you screw the toy together tightly -- that makes it more challenging for them to get the rawhide off.  Great toy!"
1.0,I have tasted date sugar that is much better than Bob's,Very disappointed in the date sugar from Bob's Red Mill. Not very tasty or sweet in comparison to other date sugars. Could be the oat flower in it. I was very dissatisfied with it.
1.0,Inedible -- So bad I threw out a nearly-full box.,"This stuff was so disgusting I ate half a bowl and threw out the rest of the box.  I'm a poor starving student and single mom, and for me to waste money like that, you know it's got to be bad.  The crispy outside is good, actually -- light, stays crispy in milk, nice texture and fresh taste.  But the ""chocolate"" on the inside is GROSS.  Tastes chemical-y, acrid, artificial -- truly inedible."
1.0,I'm ticked off,"My husband loves this gum and I'd like to order it but for some unknown reason, Amazon thinks it is a grocery item that cannot be shipped to Alaska, the 49th state of the US.  What could possibly be considered too fragile about gum to send?  I don't think it can get bruised or frozen.  Matter of fact it is warmer here than 40% of the US right now.  I'm not happy."
5.0,a magical little dollop of pure flavor,"I've been buying this in little 1.6 oz packages for a long time now, so I was delighted to find this larger size available here.  It adds just the right body and gloss to any chicken sauce or glaze.  It will make a fabulous sauce for a sauteed chicken breast in minutes.  Deglaze the pan with a bit of wine, toss in a dollop of the demi-glace, and simmer until it melts.  Adjust your seasonings, and you have an instant, silky sauce. It can make a quick weeknight meal look like a gourmet endeavor.  I agree with the others here that it will keep in the fridge for a long time, but it does dry out.  when I get this large size, I will portion it out in tablespoon dollops, freeze them on a cookie sheet, then bag them in the freezer.  This stuff lasts forever in the freezer."
1.0,Not Real Extra Virgin Olive Oil,I bought this at my local Middle East supermarket.It was priced very low and it makes sense that it isn't genuine olive oil.Probably a blend of various oils.Avoid and stick to more reputable brands.
5.0,Cofee with a kick,Excellent flavor with that extra kick I like. Great brand. I enjoyed this blend and shared it with friends who also loved it
1.0,NOT GOOD AT ALL,"So I bought this product to test it out because I read up on it and it sounded like a good new shampoo and conditioner and thinking the Clear Ultra Shea Shampoo and Conditioner would nourish my scalp, lock moisture in my hair, smooth, and seal as it says on the container it would do, turns out it does the complete opposite the shampoo stripped my hair. After shampooing my hair was hard, tangled, and dry feelong. Then I thought maybe the conditioner will help my hair so I put the conditioner in and it did NOTHING, my hair was so tangled, no kind of moisture what so ever to it, my hair was extremely dry and tangled and was very hard to detangle even after applying the conditioner. So I ended up rewashing my hair that same day with Garnier Triple Nutrition which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and would recommend to anyone! I will never ever ever buy this Clear Ultra Shea or recommend to anybody you would be better off buying some Suave shampoo and conditioner than this mess. I am very upset that I have two almost full bottles of this shampoo and conditioner that's going in the trash unless I find somebody that likes it that I know."
5.0,Great USA made Treats!,"Am so glad to have found these treats for my sensitive skin dog!  She loves this particular (Veggie) flavor.  From the easily recycled box to the natural ingredients and importantly to me, a USA made product, its a win/win situation."
5.0,pfchangs ice tea,"I was turned onto this ice tea by the very popular PF CHANGS.I have replaced soda with this very refreshing drink. I have also stopped my habbit of starbucks tea ,instead i will go home and brew my own tea.MY 14 year old neice and I will fight over the last glass."
1.0,Terrible after-taste,"I was excited to try this, particularly now that summer is here. I am not a big fan of plain water, and it's portability would make it nice for taking to playdates, picnics, etc. So as soon as I got the bottle, I tried it out. I was terribly disappointed.  There are a couple of issues I have with this. The first is that the bottle just instructs you to squeeze - no amount is listed, and you can squeeze a crazy amount at one time. I realize this is so people can make it to their own taste, but a baseline would be nice.  By far the worst part of this energy drink is the after-taste. I couldn't even finish my glass the two times I tried it. I figured maybe I just needed to adjust the flavor after the first time, so I waited a few days and then used less in the cup. The initial flavor wasn't bad (watered-down fruit punch, basically), but the after-taste was nasty. I can't even bring myself to drink any more.  I think I will be sticking with other tried-and-true water additives."
1.0,The Top Comes Off!,"I love the flavor of the tea, but I have to give it one star because the top of the K-cup comes unglued.  When you are making your drink suddenly water is coming out from all spots on the top.  Makes a mess.  Hope they fix it!!"
1.0,so disappointed in the storage of this product,"i want to first of all start off with the fact that i LOVE bobo's bars.  they are amazing and this is not a review of them, by any means.  this is a review on the actually seller of the bars here on amazon.  the bars, which are pretty much the same price to get at the store and from bobo's directly, arrived hard and overly sticky and not crumbly, as they should be.  when you buy them as they are meant to be, they are soft and crumbly and moist and amazing.  when i purchased them here, they were hard as a rock, sticky, and not crumbling in the least.  so disappointed since they are not cheap.  i recommend the bars themselves, just not through this seller."
1.0,no taste,I bought this product because I knew I liked sumatran coffee . Im new to roasting coffee but I roasted these beans many different degrees and cant get much flavor out of them. I sorry I bought 5# and will probably throw 4# away.
1.0,Fattening waste,"Do not bother buying this product. It is processed food. The definition of unhealthiness, it does not fill you up at all. It makes you feel sick after wards. America does not need to be any fatter than it already is, so please go to the grocery store and buy something healthy for your kids."
1.0,Artificial Ingredients,"Allergic to soy flour, & MSG, or SULFITE ?  Avoid THIS. It is loaded with MSG...listed in a way which disguises it.  MSG is an appetite STIMULENT. MSG  is listed  on small print label ...as ""vegetable protein (soy)"",  ""SOY protein,""  ""texturized vegetable protein"",  ""Monosodium Glutamate,"" and ""Monosodium Glutamate;hydrolyzed corn protein, and yeast extract.""  This is not a misprint. Each time it is listed on label, at least EIGHT times--indicates another DOSE of MSG. It is in the sauce, in the manicotti, in the filling of the manicotti, and in the ""meat"" which also contains ""PORK crumbles,"" which probably accounts for some of the sodium metabiSULFITE.  Sulfite is a preservative, and chemically a ""salt,"" so it is bad for people w/ heart trouble; hypertension; OR SULFITE ALLERGY ( triggers severe dangerous  asthma attacks in allergic persons, including children). It triggers migraine headaches in a large percentage of people also (Chinese Restaurant Syndrome). The product also contains two other preservatives (also ""salts"") , and table salt. Wow, ladies....wonder why you ""retain fluid?""  ASK an M.D.-- all the above is pretty accurate.  This is a fairly large group of folks who shouldn't eat this product...and I bought a couple cases- and gave them away because I have SULFITE allergy, and MSG allergy. I wish I had been able to read the ingredinets online-- I wouldn't have bought any.   Monosodium glutamate (so-called flavor enhancer is a chemical/DRUG  which crosses blood/brain barrier and stimulates appetite! ( Just what we need to sabotage weight control in a fat nation).  Even with loads of MSG --the sauce is very acidic. I think the manufacturers know it is inferior, or else WHY all the MSG? Their Dinty Moore stew tastes better, and isn't a chemical cocktail.  I wish I could have said this was a great product. Over a period of years, what happens to all the chemicals we have consumed? Please, Amazon, copy the ingredients and post it somewhere-- so we know what we are buying. I am usually happy w/ items purchased... not this stuff."
1.0,Moldy,"There was white, hairy mold on the treats in the middle of the bag.  Unfortunately, I'd already given my pups a couple of them before I found the mold, just an hour or so later. :("
1.0,Price bait & switch?,Comes up as 108 count @ $72.39 in the search.  When you click on it it's 108 @ $86+
1.0,Don't get why this has sucralose in it.,"I had read reviews for this before and somehow missed the fact that it had sucralose in it. Ugh. I made it and it smells great, tastes great, and all things considered it probably is very good if you can tolerate sucralose, but unfortunately I can't, even if it's the last ingredient listed (which it is on this). Why they added it is beyond me, but I'd wish they'd make a version without it."
5.0,You don't have to look any further,"I love using K Cups!  Although I have tried so many ""bad"" coffees.  I have finally hit on one dark roast coffee that isn't bitter and has a wonderful flavor.  You don't have to try them all, this is a perfect blend coffee."
5.0,Great Bargain,I am really pleased with the quality and quantity.  It's by far the best price that I've been able to find.
5.0,Pretty Amazing,I saw a TV show about how they make this wine and it was very amazing!! I soon hope to use it in my cooking and see how well it works in food.
5.0,"Yum, bridge mix","If you like Bridge mix, then Brach's is the best. The chocolate they use is first rate.  I used to be able to buy it at the local store in smaller bags - who thought we could eat seven pounds, or want to?  Well, this is our second delivery, so I guess we're up to 14 pounds!!  The company packs it nicely, in a well insulated box, so the mix is not abused in transit.  I will be buying from this source repeatedly."
5.0,The first day and I'm satisfied so far,I rented a place at the beach for a week and the mosquitoes swarmed us when we arrived. Big ones with no fear. Several at one time would lite on my legs and arms allowing me to smash them instead of flying. They must have been real hungry. I talked to a guy at Ace Hardware about the problem. He recommended the Cutter Backyard Bug Control. Said he had a friend who practically had stock in the stuff. I went back and sprayed as far as the hose would reach around the house. This was right about dark. The next morning at 6 am I walked the dog and there wasn't even one mosquito.  Let me compare my experience to others. The sprayer worked fine for me down to about two ounces. I held the sprayer at different angles trying to get the suction tube to pick up the liquid but it didn't work. In he end I had to just pour the last two ounces out onto the ground. Since this is my first day after applying the stuff I'll see if it lasts for the week.  From the other reviews I may have been lucky my sprayer worked as well as it did and ended up with only two ounces that wouldn't spray.  I'll update this if the mosquitoes return before the week is over.
5.0,If there is a blossoming tea heaven...,Then this tea should belong there.  Seriously. That. Good.  Tea blossoms are gorgeous.  Luxurious aroma.  I give it 10 stars!!!!!
5.0,LOVE THESE COOKIES,"I love crisp sugar cookies, these were perfect, tasted like regular gluten cookies.  Will buy over and over."
5.0,Addicted,"I am addicted to this little things. They are so good, and for this price, you can't go wrong. These sell for a lot more in stores."
1.0,just don't like these,"I plain just don't like these fruit snacks. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these are more hard than gummy. The orange ones taste pretty good, and none of them taste bad, but they just aren't awesome. I recommend Annie's brand (particularly the Berry Batch) or Ocean Spray (the Berries and Cherries is really good). Both of those brands have an amazing soft texture and don't have to sit there chewing forever as you do with the Welch's.  PS- if you are going to purchase these, they are WAY cheaper at Costo"
5.0,Delicious vanilla ice cream!,Great product from a great company!  I used this to make ice cream and it has a rich vanilla flavor and fragrance.  The product was delivered in 3 day of my ordering it.  Excellent value too.
5.0,Gluten Free Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix,"The best gluten free brownie mix I have found.  Makes soft, chewy brownies.  The entire family loves them, even my teenager.  I made them and sent them to my celiac and non-celiac kids in the service.  Noone could tell the difference from the regular ones I use to make."
1.0,Awful!,I'm not a vegan but eat mostly fish and veggies.  I've eaten many other similar kinds of products and it's a shame this so bad because it would make people just venturing into non-dairy or gluten free eating feel very apprehensive if not downright scared.  I actually had to throw the entire pot out after one taste.  I even put a bit of special salt and butter type product in to make it better.  As  my granddaughter would say.... Icky!  Maybe I will try some other items of theirs to see if I can find something nice to say :-)
5.0,Throw away your Salt & Pepper,"Ever wish you knew the secrets of a great steakhouse restaurant? This is it. It's good as we've all said here.  This is our favorite way to use it: Place 4 thin boneless chicken cutlets in a flat bowl. Add the zest of half a lemon to 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil. Pour over chicken, turning to coat both sides with lemon oil mixture. Sprinkle both sides with Cavender's Greek Seasoning - (we like a generous amount, but you should experiment with the amount until you find what you like). Heat an outdoor grill or an indoor grill pan with ridges on med-high heat. When hot & almost smoking, add chicken to pan. Don't move the chicken for 3-4 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for 3-4 minutes more, or until juices run clear. Remove to a clean platter and cover loosely with aluminum foil. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes. Chicken will continue to cook while resting. Slice and serve over salad or on a roll with lettuce & tomato. Opa! PS: You can also mix Cavender's with garlic powder to make an incredible garlic bread!"
1.0,Worst gum ever,"This is probley one of the worst pieces of bubble gum ive EVER chewed. It's extremly hard to chew and makes terribale bubbles. My daughter was conducting an experiment with bubble gum to see which gum could produce the biggest bubbles and Bazooka was the worst out of Dubble Bubble and Hubba Bubba. To be honest, id rather chew rubber."
5.0,Creamy goodness!,"I love this stuff. It makes the world's best Coconut Beef Curry.  The recipe can found in Jan Jackson's book entitled, ""100 Day Pantry"" (also sold on Amazon).  After trying this recipe, you'll be buying Thai Kitchen coconut milk on a regular basis!"
5.0,Perfect for a picky German Shepherd,"I have a German Shepherd who will not eat anything, but I just watched her eat two bowls of food after mixing in the 5 1/2 ounce can of Canidae. I'm so happy I bought this! I've been purchasing the extremely expensive Newman's organic/ Wellness formula wet foods, and even those she hasn't liked. Hopefully she'll continue to like the Canidae and put some meat on her skinny self. Plus, this brand is cheaper while still containing quality ingredients!"
1.0,Filter Does Not Fit,This filter does not fit properly in the Tassimo made by Braun.  I had to return it.
1.0,appear to be stale and moldy,i bought these for the fist  time at Petco and they were brown and clean looking. I ordered the 125 count pantry pack nylabone filet mignon flavored minis and they had green and black spots and were very hard. Trying to return them = they look disgusting compared to the pack that I bought at Costco.
5.0,Delicious,I was giving one bag of swiss creme sandwich cookies at work!!! OMG they are the best I love them I came home and order me a whole box now my family and friends are very satisfy with the Swiss Creme SAndwich Cookies.
1.0,now come on now,"This is good cocoa...But cocoa ""powder""....It's cocoa ! the extra 5-6 bucks go to the concocted name and the rabbi...I therefore give this 1 star ... not because it ain't good, but it's overpriced good...several out there are as good if not better! for about 10 bucks"
1.0,Taste horrible,Does not taste good.  Only meant for smoothies or cooking.  I have experienced matcha green tea that tastes good. I wish I remember the brand.
1.0,alternative sweetner,"I was disappointed in this product, as I had read and heard that this was an excellent sweetner, and it only took a small amount.  NOT TRUE!  I had a 8 ounce glass of tea, and added two ""straws"" of Nectar, and you couldn't even tell anything had been added.  Expensive if  you had to use a whole pack to slightly sweeten anything."
1.0,Ortho Grass B Gone for Landscapes,"I ordered this product and as far as I have been able to learn, it does not exist.  The Ortho Grass B Gone for Landscapes is supposed to kill bluegrass that grows amongst your flowers in the landscape.  The product I received, did not say that.  The one I received is Garden Grass Killer that kills weedy grasses.  Bluegrass is not even mentioned in the directions.  Instead of the blue banner on front saying Landscape this one says Kills weedy Grasses without injuring Ornamental Plants.  It isn't the product that is pictured.  Very unhappy."
5.0,Unbelievably delicious!!,"I bought two jars; one for me and one for my daughter (the foodie). She texted me a few days ago that I have ruined her for ""regular honey"" as she had just made a simple salad (greens, green onions, walnuts and crumbled good quality bleu cheese)  dressed with this honey and fresh squeezed meyer lemon juice. I have since tried it and it is everything she said and more (I threw in a diced organic pear for an over the top add on). It pays to use top products--the ingredients speak for themselves! We love Monastiri honey here in Sacramento. I can't wait to try it this summer with our luscious tomatoes----give it a try."
1.0,Utz Cheese Balls Barrels - 2 / 35 oz. is misleading,"I just want to warn the buyers that the title ""Utz Cheese Balls Barrels - 2 / 35 oz."" does not mean that you will get 2 packs.  It's only one pack and -2 is misleading.  I would recommend seller to change the title of this product as ""Utz Cheese Balls Barrels - 35 oz."".  You can get the single container for $11 as well.  I really thought I was getting 2 containers.  Though we love cheeseballs."
5.0,excellent product,"Excellent product,  tastes great, easy to make, no negatives as far as I can see......"
5.0,Authentic,"GREAT!!  There IS a difference in different country's paprika.  This is a nice, bold flavor.  I would highly recommend."
5.0,Loving green tea,Carrinton green tea is the best I have found. I really enjoy 3 or 4 cups a day. I wish could have it sent every 3 months. Love this tea.
1.0,Everlasting Treats - Wrong size,"I ordered the product and thought I was getting the large size.  I called the shipper, no returned calls and I can't really use the item shipped as I needed the large item.  How do I return, the shipper doesn't return the calls.  Not a happy customer of this product."
5.0,wonderful!!,"Coconut oil is a wonderful product for African American hair and I absolutely love it. You can even use this, solely, as a deep conditioner, or melt it and mix it with your current deep conditioner to give it an extra boost.  This seller is wonderful.  I ordered this yesterday and received it today.  Amazing."
5.0,Seriously Delicious,This stuff is not only tasty but also a healthy alternative to Nutella. It is a great product and I hope they continue to make it until the day I die!
5.0,Delicious!,"I love this rusk bread - its quality (crunchy, fresh taste, slightly sweet and filling) has not changed since I was kid growing up in Europe. You can even turn it into a porridge, by crushing several slices and adding hot milk and sugar (optional) to it. Let it simmer for a few minutes and enjoy."
5.0,All Fiber Gormet Products I HaveTried Are Wonderful,"I love Mac and Cheese and the only problem I have with FG Mac and Cheese is trying not to eat the whole box, overdosing on fiber.  It's good, and unlike the blue box mac, you can keep it in the fridge and eat the rest tomorrow or take it to work for lunch.  It keeps well in the fridge.  And I love that it is less expensive at Amazon than at FGs website.  I can't wait intill FG gets their products in my local stores.  I love all their pasta and the cheese cracker snacks are wonderful"
1.0,Too much work,"I was so excited to find these, as our local Whole Foods stopped carrying the frozen ones.  At the time, individual cans weren't available, so I ordered the ""case.""  I was really disappointed to discover on opening the first can that these beans are not peeled.  The remaining cans have been sitting in my pantry.  Last night I decided to bite the bullet and spent 30 minutes peeling to make fava hummus, which ended up tasting terrific.  But who does Progresso think they are kidding, the skins are inedible.  Will definitely try a different brand next time!"
1.0,made in China,"I am looking for rawhide bones such as these made in the USA.  The Dingo bones appeared on the screen.  These are not made in the USA, but China.  There are recent problems with dog treats made in China causing kidney failure.  Amazon, you get an ""F"" on this!"
1.0,"From China, won't be buying again.","From China, won't be buying again.From China, won't be buying again.From China, won't be buying again.From China, won't be buying again."
5.0,Life is just a bit sweeter,"I was channel surfing and purely by chance I landed on the Dr. OZ show.  As his guest tried different holistic weight loss products, I was particularly intrigued by this product.  I quickly ordered a couple of bags so I wouldn't forget to do it and I've been hooked since then.  Its great in just about anything that you would normally use sugar.  I'm an avid coffee drinker, so I particularly enjoy it's aroma and the hint of nutty flavor it adds to my sacred beverage.  Bye Bye regular sugar!"
1.0,Bad Smell + Bad Taste = AWFUL,"I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the positive reviews on this product made me hopeful. While mixing the ingredients, a foul smell filled the kitchen. When I poured the batter into the waffle iron, the smell improved slightly. Again... hopeful. Yet while the texture resembled a waffle, the taste was so bad I spit it out immediately. No syrup/whipped creme/fruit can cover up the taste. Skip the batter and try the Atkins Caramel Chocolate Nut Roll instead. Tastes just like a Baby Ruth :)"
5.0,Wonderful tea!,"This is the best tea I've ever had.  It is mild with no bitter after taste.  Easy to brew and each ""helping"" of tea pearls can be used at least three times (four makes it a little weak for my taste).  Even my husband had started drinking Jasmine Pearl tea, in the morning.  Stir in a teaspoon of honey and you have absolute heaven!"
5.0,"I've ""Switched""",I was so surprised at how good this tastes and how refreshing it is. When you drink it you know your drinking juice and not a bunch of additives. It's nice that I can enjoy and bring these with me places that might not have things that I can drink due to my diet restrictions. Finally a carbonated HEALTHY alternative!
5.0,Love it!!,"I brought 2 bottles.  One I carry in my pocket and the other for home.  I fell in love with this while on vacation in Belize.  Just a couple drops does the trick.  Packs a ton of flavor, but not too hot that it overpowers your food."
1.0,not good at all,"I tried the shirataki noodles and the rice is no different.  However, since they are small little ""dots"" similar to pastina or orzo they are easier to eat but they don't hold any sauce or gravy.  Its a shame because they are so healthy.  The texture is not good.  They are slippery.  Once you rinse both the noodles and rice at least 5 times in cold water, there is no smell but I just can't get past the texture.  Unfortunately for me, I bought 6 packages.  Can't waste my money so they will be a good filler to add to my dog's food."
5.0,Hooked!,"I came across ZICO at the supermarket and really liked the coconut water. I wanted to check Amazon because I figure that anything that goes to the retailers must already be mass produced, processed, giant corporate, ect. Since I try to avoid these things as much as possible and I know that the supermarkets are really just a few giant suppliers on the shelves, I use Amazon quite a bit and I look for the most natural stuff I can get. Taste Nirvana is one of those items that does what it says: Nirvana in a drink. Aside from sticking a straw in a coconut in Thailand, this stuff is the real deal. No aftertaste like ZICO (and ZICO's not bad mind you), just smooth as silk and satisfying. I'm completely hooked on this stuff and I plan to be, that is of course if the ever sell out to a company like Nestle and go and ruin the stuff."
1.0,"It's like the old joke: these cheese straws are terrible, and the portions are so small!","I was initially disappointed on opening the package because the packages are so tiny.  Then I was more disappointed because they are less than half full.  There were maybe 20 small cheese straws in each package.  A four pack of Paula Deen has about the same amount of cheese straws as a single package of Geraldine's (the best packaged cheese straws, in my opinion, which sell for less than $5 a package). But I suppose it's not a terrible thing that there are so few cheese straws because these taste terrible.  They use oil instead of butter, and I think that's the primary problem.  They're greasy instead of rich. They are also not nearly cheesy enough somehow.  Very disappointing on the whole."
5.0,Wow!,"What an exotic coffee! I had never tried this coffee from Community coffee before but got it on special. What a wonderful surprise it was. I started drinking it with cream and sugar but have found that it actually tastes better black. If you like an ""exotic"" coffee I think that you will like this one."
5.0,"Top-quality dog food, good for all life stages. A++++","This is great dog food. I have a puppy and three adult dogs, and this is good for all life stages (unlike some canned foods). They all love it. I usually add a quarter of a can of wet food to the dry food, and the dogs eat it all right up. I love to feed my dogs a variety of high quality food. This is a product I love to serve them. A++++"
1.0,Rip-off,This is for ONE single pouch.  I mistakenly thought it was for several pouches considering the price. Don't buy this...go to Wal-Mart and buy them for 99 cents each!
5.0,Mmmmm,I used these for my wedding. Received them on time and in great shape. We ate about half of them and had to order another bag. I would recommend these to friends and family if they need a large bag of kisses.
1.0,"Shipped wrong item, can't return!!!",I ordered this three-pack of Almond Butter but when the shipment came it was PEANUT Butter instead. Not what I ordered and it cannot be returned. Terrible customer service. Won't be ordering from Amazon/third-party sellers again for a very long time. Anyone want some PB because I sure don't!!!
5.0,"Good, but Amazon has the flavor names wrong","Flavor names vs flavor photos are pretty confusing. I ordered ""Rich Chocolate"" and received ""Rich Milk Chocolate"". Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting."
1.0,I guess I don't like stevia,"I've been trying to give up both Aspartame and High-Fructose Corn Syrup, so I was excited to find Zevia at my local grocery store. I've had stevia one other time, in coffee, and it seemed a little over-sweet, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by using a little less of it. I couldn't even finish a can of this soda though. Not only did it have the worst stevia flavor (grossly sweet and somewhat bitter), but the flavor also tasted really watered down to me. I think the Ginger Root Beer flavor could be really good if it was sweetened with something else and the non-stevia flavors came through a bit stronger. I'm glad I only got a six-pack of this rather than buying the 24 through Amazon as I've considered doing before."
5.0,Yum... I could get into these...,"I'm not a very good breakfast guy, or oats guy... but I've been trying to work out and my trainer loves him some oats.  I always love Bob's Red Mill for my flax and flour, and this got good reviews, has a good price, so it's what I went with.  I ended up just following the instructions on the package although there are lots of good prep techniques in the various steel-cut-oat reviews here and elsewhere. They came out just fine.... and the reviewer who suggested refrigerating the leftovers for an even better oat experience is correct I think... these things are yummy with each subsequent round.... this makes a batch-prepping your breakfast for a week really easy.  So far I've enjoyed this with greek yoghurt, flax-meal, chunky peanut butter, organic honey.... but I'm sure you could do any combination that works for you obviously... I'm trying to get the flavor ratio down for ultimate addiction but haven't gotten there yet.... there's just so much food to eat (yum!), not enough meals (*tear*). It's a good lucky problem to have I guess ;)  I've got freezer space for the uncooked oats so that's where I keep them.  Very pleased with this round and hope to be better about breakfast going forward!"
5.0,Heavenly New Orleans coffee,I have been buying and drinking this coffee since the first time I drank it in New Orleans. It's delicious and you get a full pound per can. I highly recommend French Market Coffee with Chicory.
1.0,AWFUL!!,"I normally order 2 pounds a month from this company, so that should apeak for itself.  For reasons unknown, I only ordered 1 pound this last time (12/7/11. This was my only stroke of good luck, for I received a bag of rancid nuts! They had a chemical taste, and I think it would have been nice if someone tasted one before shipping it out.I had to dispose of them in the trash, fearing my squirrel friend would suffer dire consequences, were he to eat one! Nuff said!Note: I just made a mistake on this order! Same company, but a later order that was for only one pound, not the 2 pound order of 12/7! That 2 pound order was fine. The next order was the bad one!"
5.0,Great addition to many soups and potato dishes,"I just tried this with a batch of my chicken noodle soup I make from scratch, gave it some extra body and from such a small amount.  Just add a heaping tsp or two, adds some smokey spice and umami as well."
5.0,this stuff makes an awesome turkey,"stab a hole, twist the knife some to pour a bit of the dry powder into each as you go along, do a hole about every 3/4"" everywhere possible. use the rest and maybe another pack as a dry rub and bake, covered or bagged.  yeah it'll be red-pink ""odd looking"".. oh well! its also great for marinating slabs of turkey with, and ham, baking and flipping as normal.  dont take my word for it, try it!"
5.0,Wonderful Russian Tea,"My husband and I recently bought a six-box lot of Impra Tea's Special Tea. It is delightful, full bodied and with a hint of citrus in it. We drink it daily. It's won my hubby away from coffee."
5.0,"Wheat free, gluten free, and low carb","These crisps are delicious and unique. They have an amazing crunch and flavor. A great treat for those on gluten free or low carb diets. I know the price seems high, but these are made from pure parmesan cheese and contain a nice amount of protein and calcium. Amazon beats the prices I have seen in stores for these yummy crisps by a mile!"
5.0,Love this shampoo,I really like this shampoo.  It does a wonderful job on my goldendoodle and German shepherd mix.
5.0,Sofa King Delicious!,This sauce is fantastic. They use it at Hannaford's supermarket for their General Tso's Revenge wings at the Wing Bar. It's the perfect blend of sweet and tangy with a hot kick to boot. It's also thick and sticky so it coats wings thoroughly. They're messy to eat but it's totally worth it!
1.0,NOT a premium dog food!,"Got this to try not realizing that the misleading photo on the package (vegetables, meats, grains) would NOT be used to make a premium dog food.  Reading the label, the first five ingredients disqualify it as any kind of premium anything!  They are: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E).  Um, where is the meat?  And ground yellow corn should NOT be the most plentiful ingredient.  Giving this to a dog insures that not only will you be feeding the dog twice as much, but that he will poop an incredible amount.  The premium dog food that my dog now enjoys (Orijen Six Fish and Seafood) costs more, but I use half as much and he poops 1-2 times a day instead of every walk.  Buy the better brands and be sure to check out the first five ingredients on any dog food before purchase."
1.0,Stale and old,These were horrible! The were stale and tasted very old. Amazon was great and refunded my money.
5.0,Where is the Hazelnut Latte?,"Love the Hazelnut Latte but-----------  Try and get it. I live in FL and CT and visit MA frequently & nowhere can you get it in CT & one place in MA. I have searched every grocery store in CT & MA. Luckily in FL Walmart & Publix carries it but if you don't get there and buy it all when it is stocked, there is a big wait until the next shipment comes in.  I like it becasue it is fairly low in sugar and so much better then any type of soft drink. I mix it with low fat milk and it serves as a lunch for me.  What I do not understand is that there is the  International coffee in the cans that flood the shelves but must be made w/hot water and some of us prefer a cold drink instead.  Everyone I have spoken to also loves this latte after they have tried it but they also have the same problem of trying to obtain the packages.  Love your product but a lot needs to be done in the marketing area."
5.0,Love it,"Love this dipping mustard.  Bought a jar from a vendor at December Nights in San Diego about 3 years ago.  Looked for them each year since but they never returned.  Finally looked on line for this mustard because we loved it.  Bought 4 jars.  It's a bit sweet, a bit tangy, a bit mustardy!!  Great with pretzels.  We also put the mustard on ham when we cooked it and it was yummy."
1.0,Gross. Just gross.,"Ok, I've had this a few times on burgers, wraps, etc., and come to a final conclusion that it's barf. It has no spicy flavor at all, just a weird, off-putting flavor type. I thought this would be like the most excellent gordita sauce that comes in the Old El Paso gordita kit - but it's not.  It's weakly flavored, and basically a way to translate fat onto your food. It's not bold or spicy whatsoever. I will give it the ""creamy"" moniker, however."
5.0,Great Running-Out-the-Door Breakfast,"After I'd purchased them once at the grocery store, our 12-year-old son kept asking me to get them again. Unfortunately, I could no longer find them anywhere in town. Thank goodness for Amazon! When the shipment came, my husband and 14-year-old son wanted to try them, too, and they both raved about them. They're not quite my cup of tea (I actually haven't tried them, because I'm afraid I'd be wishing I were eating homemade banana bread instead) - but everyone else loves them. And I hear they're particularly good after 15 seconds in the microwave!"
5.0,this will convert non tea drinkers!,"i love iced tea but i was never into hot tea. upon getting a sample tea bag of this particular flavor from a friend - i fell in love. shortly after i bought my own box. this stuff is DIVINE. its great on its own but if you add a little sweetner (i used Splenda) and some milk, the vanilla and caramel flavors are intensified which makes it all the more YUMMY. i am seriously addicted to this stuff."
1.0,Daybreak Morning Blend,"In my opinion, this is not good coffee- I've tried it plain and tried ""doctoring"" it, but cannot bring myself to drink a cup of it."
1.0,rice crumbs,"This product was a true disappointment.  When I opened the box, there was a slight odor to it.  Amazon would not let me get a refund back, and instead sent a new box of rice crumbs.  The new box of 8 packages expires in April 2011!.  Not sure I will buy food again through Amazon unless it is returnable.  Very, very dissatisfied."
1.0,Horrible...don't waste your money,I was expecting a good product but this product let me down big time. It is some of the worst macaroni and cheese I have ever eaten.
5.0,rich flavor,"rich flavor, hard to go back to drinking anything else. This is for all those real tea lovers out there"
1.0,Yucky Pancakes,"I wish I had read the reviews before attempting to make this product. The consistency was all wrong.  Only half the can left after throwing out the first two batches, what a waste of money... I felt as though it didn't have very much flavor.  I will be making Red Velvet Pancakes from scratch next time, not worth the money.  I actually ordered this for Valentines Day, but didn't receive it until the day after.  I must say that I'm very thankful it did not show up the day I was expecting it to."
1.0,Astro Pops?,I lived for my weekly (sometimes daily) astro pop in the nineties. WHERE IS IT? I couldn't be more disappointed.
5.0,Royal Canin Kitten Food,"My kittens just eat this up!  Hopefully it will help them grow to be big and healthy cats.  The morsels are just the right size, and it also helps to mix it with other more ""solid"" canned kitten foods."
1.0,Really bad metallic taste- didn't feel refreshes,"Had high expectation, but was pretty disappointed.  This had a metallic after taste and I didn't physically feel as good as I do after something like gatorade.  If you work out, stick with what you know works."
1.0,Paper or Plastic?,"I purchased this based on the good reviews.  But I have to agree with the last post.  I am pretty disappointed with this coffee.  When I opened the can, I can smell something that was a bit off; it was not particularly unpleasant but it was distinct enough to be detected.  And when I brewed the coffee, I could taste whatever it was that was causing the off smell.  It's hard to describe this taste and smell; the best I can come up with to describe the smell is that it reminds me of either paper or plastic; maybe both.  And the coffee flavor/taste is muted.  I will not purchase this product again.  I was very optimistic about this product when I ordered it as I had recently purchased and enjoyed another coffee product (regular, not decaffeinated) by Melitta.  Since this item may not be returned, I guess I'm out of luck.  I'll think twice about ordering groceries from Amazon again; especially if untried and when it comes in bulk like this one did."
5.0,Ripoff!,You can buy these at Big Lots for 50cents each!!  This Item is too expensive online.  Great product but can find it cheaper elsewhere. Big Lots
5.0,Bigelow Teas are Great,Superior blends wrapped in superior packaging....  I could say this about all 7 Bigelow teas I've bought from Amazon....  the best!!
5.0,GREAT,WONDERFUL PRODUCT.  ALL THE BREAD MIXES I HAVE TRIED ON AMAZON ARE NOT DISAPPOINTING!!!  WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.  THEY WILL MAKE GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENTS.
5.0,Great taste,This product has great taste and flavor!  It brings home the flavor Christmas morning!
1.0,tastes terrible.,This tastes incredibly bad.  No matter what you mix it with.  Wish I could get my money back.  Terrible.  I know it is a health food and really good for you but it smells like grass and tastes like what I would assume grass tastes like.
5.0,Very Good Product,"I liked this product very much..I love spam and who doesn't love bacon, but the bacon flavor is very mild, and it did not affect the consistancy of the product, it is easy to slice for sandwiches, or to cut up or cube with scrambled eggs, will keep this product in my pantry for a quick sandwich or meal.kids like it also."
5.0,Delicious!,"This candy is amazing! I'm a BIG tea fan. Iced, hot, green, black, whatever kinda tea it is, i like it. The classic iced tea tastes just like what it says... classic iced tea. The citrus is like if you were to squeeze a lemon into a glass of tea. The green tea latte is a bit strange. It tastes a lot like caramel, but also has a tea flavor to it. Its good as well. Also the shipping was great. I ordered it on a Friday and got it the next Monday. Overall, some of the greatest hard candy i've ever tried, and by far, the best tea candy."
1.0,I was disappointed....VERY much so!,"I have been buying natural nut butters for YEARS, and I have never, EVER seen on that has so much oil in it. Even when fully mixed, this was too runny to really use on bread, which in itself is ok since I don't EAT bread, but not at all what I expect from anything other than Tahini!  Is this NORMAL for this stuff, or did I get a bad batch. Just asking because I won't buy again if this is normal....."
5.0,Excellent,"I bought two jars and they were so good, that I am going to order at least two more especially now that football season has started."
5.0,The perfect blend,"I had read lots of reviews on the BEST coffee for my superautomatic espresso machine and this blend kept popping everywhere.  I have tried many other espresso beans, and this was the best.  Great smooth flavor and the best crema. And the beans aren't too oily, so they don't clog the grinder.  I go through the beans so quickly that I'm glad it's available in this larger bag.  Thanks Lavazza, I'll be buying this blend for life."
5.0,Best dehydration remedy,I drink one of these after each hot yoga class or any other workout and have even used it as a hangover cure! It tastes great too!
5.0,Love Love Love,I'm in love with this drink.  I've turned all my friends onto this and they are not hot chocolate drinkers.  Everyone who comes over goes straight for the white hot chocolate versus coffee.  It is very light and refreshing.  Enjoy!
1.0,Not for cookies,"This is very misleading. If you read up on it the Wilton website admits this is will not harden and is not recommended for cookies that you will stack. Why call it cookie icing? It is runny and very difficult to work with. I have heard that Royal Icing is the best because it hardens and is easy for piping, decorating, and using as a 'glue' for candies."
5.0,yummy,"We love these snacks in our household.  They are great tasting. What I love is the size of the package and the pieces.  They are small packages so the kids feel like they are getting a yummy, sweet treat but I am happy because it is not so big they are filling up on gummies.  The bits are small enough that my toddler can enjoy them and have not problem chewing or swallowing them.  They are impossible to find in our area so I love that they just appear at our doorstep."
1.0,NOT FRESH!,"Just received these chocolates, and they are not fresh! They are greyish looking, not chocolate brown... Not appetizing at all... I ordered 4 packages of eight, and everyone of them seems old. What a disappointment... Do not order these."
5.0,Allergic to Peanuts?  This is the trick.,"My daughter and my nephew are both terribly allergic to peanuts, but they can eat almonds.  Kids have loved PB&J sandwiches as long as I can remember - heck, I still love them!  This is a great alternative for those who cannot eat peanut butter.  It's not as sweet as the conventional peanut butters, which is probably a good thing considering all the corn syrup in them, but it tastes great!  We keep a couple of jars in the house, and I just sent a few to my nephew, who loves it too.  You do have to stir it a bit, but that's an okay trade off in my opinion.  Great job Barney Butter!"
5.0,"Delicious, convenient and gives you a great caffeine kick.",This espresso tastes very good - intense coffee with chocolate tones (even though there is no chocolate in it). It is very convenient because you can store it and you always have something when you don't have time to deals with the espresso machine. This has a great caffeine content.
5.0,SLAMM'IN SMOOTH & SEXY SUCCULENT!!!,"Don't know about you, but I don't always get things right. However, sometimes I get things smashingly right, so when I ordered this HAWAII ROASTERS 100% Dark Roasted Whole Bean 16 Oz Bag, and a ""Toastmaster"" Coffee Grinder---another Review on Amazon.com---the results were slamm'in, producing a cup of Dark Kona that was so smooth. When I topped off for a refill, adding a couple Tablespoons of ""Patron Citronge"", two Teaspoons of Organic Raw Turbinado, and Organic Half & Half, I got treated to a cup of Dark Roasted Kona that was sexy succulent!  The classy attractive colored semi-aluminum type bag contained rich aromatic, lusciously fresh oily Beans that entice you into wanting to transform them into the delicious beverage they yield. I can hardly wait for Breakfast tomorrow...  --GBJ"
1.0,"for cat pee only!!!  can't scoop poop out, stinks!!!","This is a cruel joke for cats owners. 1. the pellets are too big for poop scoops, so you can't get the poop out without ""playing"" in the crap!  2. pellets are too big to smother the stink from poop, when your cat goes #2, YOU'LL KNOW! 3. older cat wouldn't use it. I bought this stuff at walmart last night, I come home to a house that smells like it's been painted with manure! I tryed to get the ONE pile of poop out and just smeared it all over the end of the scooper. on my way to the store for my ARM AND HAMMER SCOOPABLE right now."
1.0,Vinegar Packed!,"This item was delivered on 9/20/12 and the bottle label was different.  It had a yellow and green background color and more importantly, stated ""Green Peppercorns in Vinegar.""  Of course the web site has a different label and advertises green peppercorns in brine which is what I was seeking.  Don't know if this is a onetime event due to an inventory mistake or what but just keep in mind that Amazon's policy is NO RETURNS ON FOOD ITEMS (including wrongly shipped food items).  I had to do a work around with the Amazon Returns online process (used a different refundable item to get a chat line open) and did manage a refund.  That's the good news.  The bad news is it took a lot more time than it should have to resolve an Amazon error.  If Amazon doesn't fix this issue (i.e., refunding ALL incorrectly shipped items that cannot be returned), I suggest not fooling around and just disputing charges directly with your credit card company and let Amazon sort it out on their time."
5.0,Great herb mix,"This is a great all natural herb mix that makes great dressing. We just made the basic vinegrette, but used red wine vinegar, as that's what we had on hand, and olive oil."
1.0,Pathetic attempt at Thai food,"I am going to agree with the dirty socks smell.  I actually bought two of these at the store and the first one I threw away because I was sure it had gone bad.  When the second one smelled exactly the same I figured that was actually how they really smelled.  Yuck!  The taste is, um, well I was really hungry so I just ate it.  But it does not taste like Pad Thai whatsoever.  I live in Thailand 6 months out of the year, so trust me I know what real Thai food smells and tastes like - and this isn't even close.  Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one."
1.0,Not Gift Quality,"I'd rather send flowers to a friend who is following a gluten-free diet than send this overpriced snack basket.  The price is not my only qualm, however.  The basket's presentation is lacking as well as most of the food itself.  The basket is neither sturdy nor attractive and was full of wadded and shredded paper with the snacks resting on top.  The measly portions only offer 1300 calories or so of food.  One of the snack bags is only 70 calories!  $34.99 is an awful lot to spend on around 1300 calories of gluten-free food.  The snacking nuts were tasty, in my opinion, but it went downhill from there with the poor cookies resting at the bottom.  Their flavor was ok, but the texture was so sandy and gritty that they really weren't enjoyable fare. Save your money and shop elsewhere for your gluten-free friends."
5.0,Great stuff,This product exceeds my expectations. I love the feeling of being in touch with my inner self. Herbal teas and medicines make me feel this way. This is a great weight loss start.
1.0,Lollipops were from 2011 and melted,I ordered these from the warehouse. I understand that most items are approaching their sell date. However these are from 2011. They were also very melted so you could not identify which sports ball they were. This was not a good purchase. I do not recommend these to anyone.
5.0,Tasty noodles once you get the hang of cooking them,"The first recipe I tried with these noodles was a complete disaster.  I tried just throwing them into a soup I was making and they completely dissolved.  They don't cook like wheat pasta.  I've used them several times since then and we love them.  I cook them now and rinse in cold water for recipes.  I've used them for sesame noodles and tofu spinach soup, with wonderful results.  I can't find soba noodles anywhere at local stores, so these were nice to find on Amazon."
5.0,Leonidas Belgian Chocolates,"Fresh, rich and delicious Belgian chocolates.  Definitely a winner and we will order more."
5.0,"Gourmet Baby Food, for sure!","I'm not looking a Gift Horse in the Mouth but it would have been nice to try the other flavours on my grand-daughter. However, the 2 boxes we received were both Juicy Pear and Garden Greens so I thank my blessings (and amazon Vine) and am reviewing that flavour.  I made 100% of my daughter's and son's baby food and know how long that took. In today's much busier world with two working parents, providing very healthy food for babies is tough. I also never gave my children anything that I wouldn't find tasty, so I knew that I needed to try this product before I experimented on my grand-daughter.  I squeezed the contents from the intriguing packaging into a small bowl. First I tried it at room temperature and then heated it as recommended (bowl set into warm water, NOT microwave!) and tried the remainder of it that way. BOTH versions were good but I enjoyed it cool, much moreso. When cool, the pears dominated; when warm, the greens dominated. I was amused that the flavour was very similar to a gourmet chilled soup that I make in the summertime. :)  My grand-daughter just finished an entire package of this in a wee bowl (with my help) and she LOVED it! I like the fact that it's not just fruit or just vegetables but BOTH. As it stands, we'll power through what we received and then go on the lookout for the other flavours available.  Both my daughter and I really appreciated the convenient pouch, which makes feeding the baby very simple when you are out and about. No glass to break and you can squeeze the puree onto a baby spoon, making feeding a snap. Baby, mom and me all heartedly recommend both the product and packaging."
5.0,Very nice Chocolate coffee,My wife and I really like this coffee. Not too strong but still reasonable with good flavor.  It's become our default chocolate coffee.
1.0,"Used it once, but never again","Bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had, plus I didn't know any better.  Was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time.  The bisque was good, but little did I know, it could have been much better.  Because this product was so expensive -- it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor -- I looked to Amazon for an alternative.  Found  Mae Ploy Thai Red Curry Paste - 14 ounce per jar  and gave it a try.  Prepared the same butternut squash bisque and Oh. My. Goodness!  What a difference!!  Try the Mae Ploy ... you will get a HUGE container for a fraction of the cost, and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible.  Kept in the fridge, it keeps for a good long while.  But, when you taste the wonderful flavor, you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste.  Try the yellow and the green curry too.  Totally different tastes."
5.0,Good candy!,My young son is taking chinese in school and wanted to buy chinese candy for his class to try.  We got several different kinds and Good Luck Candy was one of his choices.  It was a hit with his class.  Everyone liked it and every last piece was eaten at school.
5.0,Best cat food ever,My cat is diabetic and was on insulin twice a day. I started researching and found that this was the highest protien lowest carb wet cat food I could get. My 15 year old cat now eats Petite Cuisine morning and night and has Purina DM Diebetic management dry food available 24 hours a day and he is no longer on any insulin. He loves the Petite Cuisine it is ALL Natural and looks and smells like people food. I'm afraid to taste it but the ingredients are all good enough for humans so they are great for my cat!! I strongly recomend this food.
5.0,Kid loves these and so do I,My 1yo loves these and I like them two.  They are tasty.  The peach and the sweet potato ones are great
1.0,Bloomed Chocolate,"I've often enjoyed these chocolate squares, however, my last purchase of them was completely inedible.  The chocolate had bloomed terribly and had a chalky taste and texture."
5.0,Dog Biscuits-- Healthy and Good,"These are made with just a few all natural, healthy ingredients, nothing else!  I feel good giving them to my dogs and my dogs LOVE them!  Thanks Amazon for a great price on a great product."
1.0,"All Ginger, No Lemon = Nasty Taste","I was really looking forward to trying this, but it tasted like a bunch of raw ginger put through a juicer & heated up (and I followed the preparation instructions). I coudn't taste any lemon at all. I do use ginger from time to time, so I am not anti-ginger, but this tasted terrible & upset my stomach.  If you decide to try this, I hope you REALLY like ginger."
1.0,Tastes funky,"We bought this as a fake non dairy, ""natural"" creamer for coffee, just tastes wierd, I'll leave it at that.."
1.0,horrible,"By initial appearances, this looks like it could be very good.  Sweetened by honey - good, natural - good, but then take a look at the actual ingredients.  Not much natural about this.  Sure honey is one of the ingredients, but so is sucralose.  I know plenty of people are fine with this or use it as a substitute for sugar for dietary reasons, but I can't stand the stuff.  The mix of different tastes (tea, pomegranate, sucralose) is very unpleasant to me.  Of course tastes vary between any two people and you may enjoy this, but be aware that it does contain artificial sweeteners if that is not what you are looking for.  I have also tried the Mango version and although it also contains sucralose, it is a bit more tolerable."
5.0,Deliciously Healthy,"This thick, rich chocolate syrup is so delicious and satisfying.  I have been dieting for a month and have lost 21 pounds.  I am basically following a low glycemic diet and having this chocolate treat has been wonderful!  Just a spoonfull right out of the jar is such a treat.  It is also very good drizzled over strawberries or other fruit and I also mix it into my 8 year old son's milk for a wonderfully healthy chocolate milk.  It takes longer to stir into cold milk than the other syrups made for cold milk, but it does slowly dissolve and my son loves that some sticks to the spoon and he gets to lick the spoon after he drinks his milk!  Haven't tried it in warm milk yet, but I know it will make amazing hot chocolate as well.  Can't say enough good about this Chocagave!"
1.0,Dishonest packaging,"Made the mistake of taking the picture at face value.  As other reviewers have stated, there are actually only 10 bars broken into two pieces.  The price is not $0.74/package, but actually $0.74/bite."
5.0,Yummy Earth - Very Yummy,"So yummy, good for the earth, sweet yet not too sweet, and very flavorfull lolipops. I am willing to let my kids have these once in a while as a treat and like to have one occassionally myself."
1.0,Stale cookies,I rememberd the Sunshine rasin cookies of my my youth. These looked like them so I purchased the tin.  Not very good. Dry as the desert.  Perhaps they were just stale.
5.0,wonderful,i can't get kosher products where i live. and this is a staple in my home. the only problem i had with it was the amount of water they want you to use per box-10 cups. i found it very bland/watery. i cut the water back to 7-7 1/2 cups with great success
1.0,Formula changed; mostly corn now; yuck,"My son used to love the Chick Chick, Gobble Gobble, and Super Salmon. But they changed the recipe, and now it's more corn than anything else. Taste is bad too. Nutrition value is lower. He doesn't like it, and neither do I. I am totally pissed."
5.0,Refreshing blend of mint,"We drink a lot of tea at our house and I've had about every brand of mint there is.  Some are quite strong but this blend is a more subtle blend of mints that would be impossible not to like.  My daughter adds a bag to a tall glass of water, waits a short time and enjoys it as a cold mint drink.  I prefer hot tea, so pour boiling water over the bag, steep for a few minutes and then sip.  Each of us leaves the bag in while drinking, and my daughter really likes the string and tag because they aid her in keeping control of the bag while drinking.  I also like the foil pouch it comes in, as I can keep a teabag or two in my purse so that when I'm visiting a friend I can enjoy a cup of my own tea, even if they don't have any flavors I like.  The foil bag is very strong so does not come apart in my purse, and keeps the tea fresh.  Update: I've been drinking this for a couple of weeks now on a daily basis.  It took me until early this morning to make the connection that during the same period of time, I have been having difficulty getting to sleep.  I finally checked the ingredients list more carefully and noticed two ingredients designed to keep you awake.  First is black tea, which contains caffeine.  Second is guarana.  I have some experience with guarana and am perhaps more sensitive to it than most, but I cannot sleep when taking it.  Yesterday I drank a cup of tea at 3pm and went to bed exhausted at midnight.  By 4am - 13 hours after drinking the tea! - I was still wide awake.  So it is not that I'm drinking it right before going to bed - I'm drinking the tea during the late morning to mid-afternoon time period and it is still wreaking havoc with my sleep patterns.  I'm so glad to have figured this out and wish I'd known it earlier as quite honestly, it would have factored into my rating of the product, which I am now unable to change.  So - buyer beware.  By all means try it but be aware that it might keep you up more than you want it to."
5.0,Organic Puff Lover!,"My baby is in love with these puffs. When we bring out the container, he gets so excited! They melt nicely in his mouth, which is good because he sometimes likes to stuff his mouth with a few at a time. Not only are they (to my knowledge the only) organic puffs, but they also have a fraction of the sugar compared to other brands.  My baby loves the green, banana, and apple flavors. I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.  As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack. However, my baby loves these so much, that we'll definitely use them before he outgrows them or they expire."
5.0,a great tasting snack (small meal) substitute,"If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom.  They really are that delicious.  And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc).  These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds.  Edit on 9/27/07:  This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor.  I just noticed that Amazon is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed."
1.0,Doesn't like,My dog refuses to eat it and it smells pretty bad. I can't recommend it as treat when my dog refuses to touch it.
1.0,"Mmm, unsalted cardboard!","Possibly the worst product masquerading as a cracker that I've ever put in my mouth. They may be allergen free, but it's more pleasant to go without."
1.0,Expired Chips,Purchased an assortment of chips as a gift and they were expired when received. Had to throw in the garbage.
1.0,Ginger & Mustard??,"These were very disappointing.  I ate a small handful and physically went, ""blehhh"".  I'll eat them because they weren't cheap and I really like nuts but I definately wouldn't buy them again. The name ""Steakhouse Seasoning"" is, imo, misleading in that the ingredients list (which wasn't available when I purchased them through my daughter's school *fundraiser* program or I wouldn't have bought them) includes ginger & Mustard (seriously?).  Now, I don't know what steakhouse Paula Deen goes to where they use ginger or mustard to season their steaks, but I wouldn't want either one on mine, I can tell you that; and it doesn't work on a nut, either. It is an odd combination of spices altogether, really...and they just don't work. Check it out: INGREDIENTS:  Paprika, Onion Powder, Mustard (?! on steak??), Ground Ginger (??), Black Pepper, Ground Cumin (WHY?), Whole Thyme, Ground Red Chili, White Pepper. Save your $$ and choose something else.  PS:  Her ""House Seasoning"" peanuts are better but kinda salty, which I don't mind.  Those have S&P, Onion and Garlic Powders...but I wouldn't buy those again, either. Hope this helps!"
1.0,gross texture,"It did not really taste like much, so I was able to add sauce without interrupting the flavor, however I could not get past the texture. I'd rather chew on rubber bands."
5.0,Finally found the watermelon jello!!!!,I have not been able to find this in sooooooooooooooooooooo long and am thrilled to have it once again!  I love making cool whip pies with it!
1.0,Premium Saltines are no longer premium in taste.,"I agree with most of the reviewers in this review.  I too have bought Premium Saltines all my life (I'm now 63) and they are now:  1. flimsy - will break in half or in pieces when spreading with peanut butter, 2.  poorly packaged - have many broken crackers in each tube which as another reviewer pointed out is due to flimsier cardboard packaging, and most importantly 3. have virtually no taste any more.  It is indeed a sad day that one of our old standbys has fallen victim to cost-cutting to enhance company profits.  Thanks to the reviewer about Keebler crackers....I'm switching."
1.0,Not worth the risk,Expiration on packaging says 10/02/12 and today is 08/09/12 so I called Amazon and they refund the purchase because they can't reship because this is a common problem with this product. I have to say I don't think the exp. date was anything but deliberate on the companies part.
1.0,Good Product...but buy the 700-ct,Amazon sells a 700-ct for $15..why would i ever pay $35 for 1000-ct(plus shipping on 1000-ct)....seems crazy.  Look up the 700-ct and you'll be siked.
1.0,You'll lose weight,"I like white cheddar.  I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting.  I like soy.  I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.  But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack?  It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.  As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours."
5.0,Madagascar Vanilla Beans,"After research online and speaking to friends, I decided to order vanilla beans on Amazon from Vanilla Products USA.  The beans arrived shortly therafter and I immediately began preparing the beans for my extract.  Although it will be a few more months before I can bottle up my special brew, I look forward to using it in my own kitchen and giving samples to our family this Christmas.  These beans were just perfect for my extract.  I'm using the bonus 1/8 pound gourmet planifolia vanilla beans in my desserts.  I will be reordering.  Karen F"
1.0,crap,"This stuff is crap.  It kills flowers, there leaves & curdles after a week.  Waste of time & money"
5.0,Great bars,"Love these bars!  For 120-130 calories, you think you're eating a candy bar!  Way to go Kashi!"
1.0,what a crock!,My 2 cats had no reaction from this. Wanted to use it to help with a possible long distance move. Instead I've just wasted money on this crock!
1.0,Did not like,YUCK! This is the worst tasting soup I have ever had the misfortune to try. Took one bite and couldn't believe how bland and off tasting this was...took one more just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The rest of the can went down the disposal.
1.0,"wow, overrpriced!","Boy, do I feel dumb. I heard how peanut butter prices were going to shoot up because of a bad crop this year, and decided to stock up before they did. If I'd done some research before I clicked Buy it now, I would have realized these are WAY overpriced - $5/jar, when I saw them at Target yesterday for about $3/jar. I blame no one but myself - I've gotten so used to prices on Amazon being better than local retailers, I just bought without thinking. My rating is not for the Jif, which I love, but for the 66% overcharge.  Perhaps, if prices do skyrocket, this price will actually be good, but for the time being, save yourself about $12 and make a trip to the store."
1.0,No more non-GMO on label,"Bought the nacho chips regularly for my kids but the last delivery came and there was not a non-GMO label on the package anymore, they still use organic corn but use non organic canola oil and any non organic canola is most likely Genetically Modified, which is something I do not want in my body.  Will not buy this product again."
5.0,My cat is addicted!,"My cat has two issues, early CRF and IBD.  The IBD caused her to stop eating completely.  Prior to that, she was very picky and wouldn't eat any renal diet(and I tried them all).  I originally passed on Hi Tor because of the by products, but I was bent on getting her to eat a renal diet.  Fortunately, she loved Hi Tor.  She is always crying to be fed now, and eats 2 cans a day, and would eat more if I let her.  Cats are picky, so not every cat will like it, but if you have a CRF cat that isn't eating, it's worth a try.  If your cat won't eat it, donate it to a shelter or a rescue group.  I'm sure they have CRF cats that could use it.  Update 2/20/10:  They have changed the formula for the food.  It's more dense, and the cans are 5.5oz rather than 6oz. It looks more like regular cat food and less like chopped bits o' parts. My cat doesn't like this as much, but that may be the fact that she can't lick it up like the previous version.  I have to try adding water to it to see if it helps."
5.0,Death by Chocolate !!!!!,"This is by far the BEST of all the Chex Mix flavors!  The chex cereal pieces are covered in rich, dark chocolate, with a few vanilla-flavored pieces mixed in for variety. Then there are the Dark Chocolate covered pretzels, dark chocolate cookies, and topped off with dark chocolate mini m&m-type candies. What more do you need?  I just wish it was still available at WalMart so I wouldn't have to wait on the shipping.  One word describes it all:  AWESOME !!!!"
5.0,Caught a mole in 5 minutes,"Wow, I am impressed.  Read all the reviews and thought this trap sounded like a good bet for my mole woes.  Put 3 into the ground following other's tips and caught a mole in 5 MINUTES!!!  I kid you not.  By the time I put the shovel away, took off my shoes, and looked out my window one of the traps had sprung.  I thought it was because I put it in wrong!  Nope, dead mole - right there in the trap.  These things rule!"
5.0,Quick delivery and good selection,First time buying the nespresso capsules on amazon and amazed how FAST they shipped and how easy the transaction was. The variety pack was a good way to try multiple coffee roasts if you are new to Nespresso.  Will definitely order more!
5.0,Great price - great product,Nostalgia has me reaching for the Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix - my grandmother used it in a ton of recipes growing up. I was happy to find the warehouse deals of this mix when re-creating a recipe a month or so ago. Now I'm glad I have the extra boxes to make more!
5.0,Flavorful organic vanilla,"I use this exclusively in homemade ice creams, frosting, eggnog,and other uncooked items. If you want a vivid vanilla flavor, I highly recommend this product. So glad I found it here ,as the price is less than other sellers that I've purchased from."
1.0,Very disappointed...,"I wanted to have the best movie theater tasting popcorn for my son's upcoming carnival birthday and was very disappointed in this popcorn.  I love salty foods, but this was way too salty even for me.  And the tast was just off.  It tasted chemically or artificial.  Based off of the positive reviews, I bought to boxes - 48 packs - and it's just a waste because they will go in the garbage."
1.0,CANCELLED,REMOVE THIS ITEM AND STOP TAKING ORDERS FOR SOMETHING YOU DO NOT HAVE IN STOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This really needs to be changed to say OUT OF STOCK!!!!
1.0,Watch expiration dates!1,"1st: my cats really don't eat this brand with much relish like they did when Wellness had the mylar bags. We really miss those bags, the food just seemed to taste better to my cats. Canned, they won't touch any flavor but turkey.  2nd: I've had 3 out of 12 in a case smell off and even the dogs won't touch it. So just check yours JIK.  What has happened to this brand? They were the BEST 2 years ago!"
1.0,Horrible bitter and lemon taste. I recommend Diet Gold Peak Tea instead,"This tea is not pleasant to drink. It has a bitter lemon taste that lingers in your mouth. Very dissapointed. Amazon WILL NOT take returns on Grocery items so please DO NOT BUY this item. EWWWW, YUCK."
5.0,great!,"Fantastic cupcakes! We did these, along with chocolate, for my sister's bridal shower. Much more of a hit than your usual cake.  The tops seem a little flat, but they are easier to frost. They taste great!"
1.0,Will make your stomach hurt,"Nasty. The leaves are so mushy, the stuffing (rice) is tastes awful and bitter. Your stomach will hurt. Don't bother buying."
1.0,Just plain awful,"I can at least tolerate most foods, but these bars were so bad that I threw them away.  Very disappointing."
1.0,"Pretty Shady, Amazon","No, I love these crackers.  I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.  This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet.  Just not too bad at all  EXCEPT  The order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.  I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.  The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special.  In the end, the loser is me.  When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.  Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others:  Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.  Shame on you, Amazon."
1.0,2 lbs. of $20+ compost,"Yes, I am a coffee snob. But this is only because I have discovered that I very much enjoy the differences gained from the effort and the investments of time and money...it works so much better if one uses the consistent grind of coffee that can be achieved with a conical burr grinder (my purchase of the  Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Slim Coffee Grinder  was a crucial step towards coffee nirvana) versus the mixture of chunks and powder that comes out of a cheap electric blade grinder; the kind of smooth, rich, full-bodied nonacidic brew that comes from steeping evenly and quickly, like a real espresso machine can achieve or that I've been experiencing with the far less fussy and amazingly engineered  Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker , completely surpasses drip or French press; and the beans matter. In fact, it is really all about the beans. And they have to be fresh, for starters.  This crap -- and I do mean crap! -- is anything but fresh.  It tastes to me like the batch I received recently was roasted two years ago and sat on some shelf in a warehouse the whole time. No thanks!  How do I know this? By taste, of course. And there is no ""best by"" date on this package to refute my claim.  Since purchasing the Hario grinder and the Aerobie press, in July of this year, I enjoyed two other very good French roasts from ""Just Coffee,"" purchased at my local cooperative grocery (yes, organic), and one purchased here,  Volcano Dark Roast, Organic Kona Hawaiian Coffee, 8 Oz, Whole Bean . Every last cup brewed from these was heaven. During that time, I periodically washed the Hario grinder to remove the coffee oil buildup whenever I would begin to detect the effects of rancidity, and before trying this batch from Altura, I washed it again. So I know that everything necessary for a great cup of coffee was in place and ready to go.  Except the beans this time were the deal breaker. A brew using freshly ground coffee beans stored in vacuum canisters should not taste bitter. The first cup was reminiscent of gutter water. I will not be falling for this again.  To Amazon's credit and with my deepest gratitude, customer service responded to my feedback. But in all honesty, I believe this product should be removed from sale here."
1.0,"What, what?","Probably geared for the revolution, cutting edge ""let's ban mayo-type advertisement"". Picked up by mistake and found it sweet and far too intruding to compliment any dish, specially sandwiches or salads. Obviously I am not cool but I can assure you my taste buds know by instinct what is repulsive at first taste and this one, miracle whip, can not compete in my kitchen. Got so aggravated that I returned the product to my local market claiming about a ""funny taste"" which saved me, cheap cheap me, the money spent."
5.0,YUMMY! MORE THAN PERFECT......,ALL I CAN SAY IS YUMMY. YUMMY.........THESE ARE GREAT! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR. COME AND GET IT.  thanks alot
1.0,Lousiest chips you can ever have,"My favorite flavor of chips happens to be Jalapeno. I have sampled dozens of different brands of Jalapeno flavored chips. This was my first time trying out this brand, and I can tell you that these were the worst jalapeno flavored chips I have ever tasted in my life. They smelled and tasted of stale oil and there was not even the slightest taste of jalapeno in the chips, whatsoever. They were excessively salty and greasy. Needless to say that I dumped the entire bag in the garbage bin after the first handful. Oh, by the way the one-star rating is only because it is not possible to write a review without selecting at least one star. They don't deserve any."
1.0,"It's only one month away from ""Better if used by"" date","This seller is very tricky, I got 6 boxes of 24 bars (total 144 bars) and I have to finish them before 2/3/2011.  I need to eat around 4 bars everyday (weekends too) in order to meet the dead line.  Very bad situation."
1.0,Great product usually- shipment stale,"I love these protein bars!  I eat them every weekday for breakfast as it is fast, easy, filling, and great tasting.  I also love the value that you get from buying a 3-pack through Amazon.  I have ordered these 5-10 times prior, and they were usually so incredibly fresh.  However, when I ordered them most recently in early 2012 they were stale to the point that they were inedible.  As this appears to be an issue with more than my order I am quite hesitant to order again.  Maybe there could be some sort of quality control in your warehouse?"
5.0,DELICIOUS!!!,"oh man, i love this candy! it's super delicious, but its really not that sour. I'd always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each! =)"
1.0,cottonseed oil,"If you are interested in healthy snacks, beware that this product lists cottonseed oil as a ""possible"" oil used in its prepartion on the back of the package, and once you receive your package you cannot return grocery items."
5.0,Wonderful product,Could no longer find this brand of Buttery seasoning for popcorn in our grocery stores. It is my husband's favorite (Jolly Time). He was quite surprised and pleased when he received it in the mail.
5.0,Nothing aMatcha about this product,I'm a green tea lover...having been to Japan 4 times and growing up with many Japanese. I've been ordering this brand now for 3 yrs..it is excellent.
1.0,Very sweet cookie,"In the mood for something extra, extra, extra sweet? You will enjoy this cookie then. Otherwise just buy when you have a big crowd. The first cookie isn't bad but all others after that just add up to an unpleasant eating experience.  As far as taste is concerned, past the super sweetness, it does taste pretty good with plenty of chocolaty peanut butter flavor.  But, wow, are they sweet! How did Nabisco pack so much sweet into such a small cookie?  The cookie is about as thin as one side of the Oreo creme filled cookie. Kudos to Nabisco for actually covering the whole cookie with fudge and not just the front side. There is a thin layer of some sort of peanut butter creme on the top side of the cookie under the fudge coating. The PB seems to be where most of the awful sweetness is coming from.  I'm not someone that reads every nutrition label for everything I buy and usually I just take it as a given that a treat like a cookie is not super healthy. But these little jewels are so sweet it will make you wonder exactly what you are eating.  Dang. 3 cookies is 9g of fat and 170 calories (80 fat). Contrast that with the traditional Oreo: 15 cookies for 160 (60 fat) and 7g fat.  I think it is worth mentioning since I couldn't find any nutritional information on the product page.  I'm not a fan of the eat healthy band wagon but good Lord. Surely a warning label should be required on something that looks so innocuous. Maybe the outline of a hugely obese person and a fat playful exclamation mark.  Let me also point out that if you buy this from Amazon you need to have someone available to get the package as soon as it arrives if it is moderately warm in your area when you purchase them. My shipping package was left out in the sun a while and some of the cookies that had come out of their slots were somewhat melted and stuck together. Nabisco did a great job with the tray they ride in but shipping may unseat them and then the heat will glue them together. I threw mine in the freezer for a bit to solidify the fudge before I opened them.  Oh. I have to say that I like the resealable package. I guess I haven't bought that type of package before or if I have all the cookies were gone before they could be resealed. It works very well and is much easier than the usual zip lock type resealable package.  1 star for an excessively sweet taste in an excessively sweet cookie that could be a poster child for bad industry."
1.0,SCAM.  STAY AWAY,"As the reviewer above stated this is not for two 12 packs.  Rather this is for one 12 pack with 6 of each variety.  What a rip off.  Amazon, this is a major deal breaker.  If I could find a 1800 number I would have called and went beserker, but there is not one.  This would have been a -1 if possible."
1.0,Very salty,"This is more like seasoned salt than ""creole."" We have it at local dollar stores where I like and they can't give it away there."
1.0,Guess SPREAD doesn't really mean NATURAL?!,"I've been a consumer of natural peanut butters ""forever"" & am familiar with its ingredients. That's why I felt confident ordering JIF, a name brand online. HOWEVER, the ingredients really need to be listed on Amazon. This natural peanut butter has molasses & palm oil in it. Palm oil I'd seen before & do limit intake of it but for a bulk ""emergency"" type food, I was willing to allow it. This JIF is listed as ""no stir"" so I figured palm oil was an ingredient. The molasses was a new 'trick"" to me. Several of my family are allergic to calcium & can't tolerate JIF's 2%Ca , a result of the molasses. So now I'm making a donation to the local homeless shelter instead of to my family's emergency stock. Even though we're ""Prime "" Amazoners ,I'm not returning it because I have a feeling Amazon will say the return's not their fault & the shipping would be ginormous due to the weight. Since the ingredients are listed on the individual jars, the shelter can make informed use of it."
1.0,STAY AWAY!!!!,STAY AWAY!!!!  You have been warned.  This is the most foul tasting rubber you wil ever try.  I am sorry I was forced to give it 1 star.
5.0,well balanced snack option,"It's hard to find a good snack drink with a healthy blend of fats, carbs, and protein.  Orgain has a good balance of macros in an all-organic blend.  And the creamy chocolate fudge is absolutely delicious - satisfies my chocolate cravings with no guilt!"
5.0,For Your Child or Your Dog!,"We originally bought this for Sadie, our 75-pound golden retreiver.  For a few months, she showed some interest in the cute, small, squeaking toy, gingerly taking it in her mouth like as it were her her little puppy (insert collective ""awwwww"" here).  However, after awhile she showed only sporadic interest in it. It appears she would much rather show her chops by chewing, biting , and ""wrestling"" with larger stuffed animals, such as a gorilla, her current favorite.  HOwever, our now 90-something pound 10-year old boy loved this when we first bought it several years ago. The hedgehog is soft and cuddly. It's a perfect take-to-bed size, and probably costs less than stuffed animals designed specifically for children. So, for either your dog or your child, the hedgehog is sire to find a loving and/or biting home."
1.0,BEWARE THE SMALL PRINT SHIPPING CHARGES,Be aware that the shipping charge is per box and not per shipment.  I purchased three boxes with standard shipping(sold by Target) and paid $27 shipping for standard shipping. The one star rating is for the transaction and not for the product.
1.0,More packaging than product...,"I guess I should have read the description more carefully.  Box contains 24 small boxes, each of which contains less than 15 pieces.  I paid way too much for this."
1.0,Don't use Blue Buffalo :(,"October 8, 2010. The Blue Buffalo Company of Wilton, Connecticut has announced a dog food recall of certain batches of some of its popular products due to potentially toxic levels of vitamin D.  My dog got extremely sick, and was very upset to hear of this.  Only thing that changed with his diet/life was blue buffalo.  I literally almost lost my dog last week and had to have in surgery because his gallbladder was about to explode.  He quit eating completely, was throwing up, diarrhea, and took him to the vet to realize his liver was swollen and gallbladder had to come out.  It's sad to think you pay good money for dog food and you still could be feeding him poison.  I don't know how I will every trust dog food products anymore.  Please make sure there is no recalls on food you are feeding your dog."
5.0,Exactly what I was looking for!,"I needed to severely cut down on my sugar intake, and also want to stay away from artificial/chemical sweeteners. Stevia is ok but still gives me that aftertaste that I don't find appealing. It's good for some things, but not everything. This product is amazing! I'm so glad to have found something that is sold in its natural, organic, raw state that is low-glycemic and actually good for you!"
5.0,outstanding butterscotch,These are awesome and delicious.  Excellent price for so many (a really big bag) pieces.  The taste is buttery and not too sweet.  The candy is HARD and  not soft or sticky like some butterscotch pieces that are out there.
1.0,Misleading Image of Item,"Be aware that the image shown is not the true product you will receive. The product I received is the new blend ""from the makers of Maxwell House"". The new blend tastes a lot differently from the original blend. I ordered the product from Amazon.com because it gave the impression they had the original blend. I would not have ordered it if I had known otherwise....and it is a non-returnable product. I feel this is very misleading and unfair.  General Foods International Coffee, French Vanilla Cafe Coffee Drink Mix, 9-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6) "
5.0,Great Bold Taste,"This is a nice bold smokey coffee, that does not have a bitter finish. I enjoy this all day long and provide it to my customers."
5.0,sugar free and yummy!,"Personally, I hate most of sugar free products. Imagine my surprise when my (diabetic) husband brought these home. I tried them... and LOVED them ever since. For some reason, the chocolate sugar-free Kedem is hard to find in the store. So go ahead and order yourself a box of delicious tea biscuits! You'll never believe that they are sugar-free because they taste so good!  Enjoy!"
5.0,Best Vanilla Ever,"I use a ton (okay ... exaggerated) of this vanilla powder.  Lattes, tea, coffee, baking, oatmeal, cold cereal ... anywhere you want that sweet floral goodness that is vanilla.  Plus it doesn't have the alcohol AND it doesn't drip.  Perfection!  I even keep it in a shaker bottle right next to the salt and pepper 'cause I use it so much.  Highly recommended!   Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Powder 16 oz. "
5.0,My Favorite,"Mon Cheri is my all time favorite.  My family in Italy sends them to me.  They are only available in the wintertime.  Beware:  If you try them, you get hooked."
5.0,delicious,"French Vanilla Cappucino has a very good taste and really enjoy drinking it, very addictive, can't just drink one cup.  highly recommend this flavor"
5.0,Good,I ordered these because peppermint is soothing for your stomach and they're organic. They taste great and knowing their organic is a bonus.
1.0,gummi glob,"I ordered the gummi bears and I recieved a gummi blob. I contacted amazon and they said they would sent me another order for free.   Guess what?! I now have two gummi blobs.   If you live in a warm climate,careful you may end up with a gummi blob."
1.0,My dog gagged-hated it,"I purchased because of one good review !!! Surprising my dog hated it, wouldn't go near it, much less try it. I didn't care for the smell much. She likes the beef stew a little more, and loves the chicken. My son's dog ate it like it was his last meal. Will not buy again."
1.0,WHY PAY THAT MUCH?,"Why would you pay $13.50 for 10 Caps, when you can buy them on the Nespresso website for less then 1/2 of that?  $6.00 on Nespresso.com"
1.0,Stale,"Very dissapointing, item arrived stale and barely edible.  I tried everything I could think of to fix them... toaster, microwave, oven.  Nothing worked."
5.0,The scent of Vanilla hit me before I opened the zip lock bag!,"These Madagascar Vanilla Beans, are of the highest quality. They are soft and pliable as well as fragrant. They bear no resemblance to the dried up vanilla beans you can buy in a jar at the supermarket.  I add mine to my home made limoncello. I just cut them down the length of the bean, and spread the bean open and tie it in a knot and drop it in. They impart an incredible, natural flavor of vanilla. The seller is also very nice to work with."
5.0,Enjoying non meat foods,I have had these since I was a little boy.  I still love them now as much as when I was young.
1.0,Don't Buy,"The pods do fit into a compatible E.S.E. machine. However, the coffee isn't as strong or flavorful as your regular espresso from a cafe. Overall, you'd be much better off going for the ground or whole bean coffee. Don't waste your $10 bucks on this lousy product."
1.0,My FAVORITE but WAYYYYY cheaper at Costco!!!!,"It's delicious however you can buy a 3 pack of the 32 oz. boxes for $7.95 at Costco!  Also, it's $4.95 for 1 at Starbucks!!!!  Why are they charging SOOOO much for these 3 boxes!  What a rip off...they should be ashamed for charging so much!!"
5.0,Excellent Tea with Delightful Ethical Aftertaste,"This is fine tea. English Breakfast Tea is a bit of a commodity, and an increasingly familiar one. This variation is quite good, not as piquant as some alternatives--and not leaving the rather bitter aftertaste one sometimes finds in combination. If you tend toward a milder tea, this one may well please you.  The company that produces this product is part of the Ethical Tea Partnership. For those interested, I would suggest visiting ethicalteapartnership dot org. The list of participating companies includes giants such as Tetley and Twinings, and is missing some other familiar names.  Something more to think about, something else in favor of this product.  My overall suggestion: find a tea you like, and find one that is from a member of the Ethical Tea Partnership. There's no one rule for taste--but there are universal expectations of ethics, realizable ideals.  This tea will meet those criteria for many people."
1.0,Tastes Like Eating Chemicals,"I eat the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal every day, and unbeknownst to me, my wife started giving me the ""Lower Sugar"" version. On the first day, I just thought my taste buds were off and ignored it, but after a few days I started to wonder what happened to the oatmeal that I used to so enjoy. To me, it now tasted like chemicals.  I went to look at the box to see that it said, ""Lower Sugar"". Now I had found a clue, but I couldn't really blame my wife because I don't really need the oatmeal to be super sweet. I'm fine with less sugar, although that wasn't my issue. It tasted like chemicals.  Upon ingredient inspection, I found that this ""Lower Sugar"" version contains the artificial sweetener ""Sucralose"" which I am really sensitive to. I know some people can't really taste the difference between Sucralose and sugar. I wish I was one of them.  I also wish that Quaker would have mentioned the artificial sweetener clearly on the front of the box.  Be warned. It's not just lower in sugar, which I would have been fine with. We had to throw away 2 boxes."
5.0,The best mango pickle!,"I've been buying this for years, as mango pickle, not relish. It's the same thing, but this is cut in smaller pieces. It says it's mild, but that's by indian standards; it is somewhat hot."
5.0,Made my aunt very happy.,"I sent this chocolate to my elderly aunt who was thrilled, as was her immediate family.  You would have thought that I sent her a bag of gold.  It is a good idea to let the recipient know a sensitive package is coming, especially in the south (she is in GA).  It has some protective packing, but could melt if left outside for an extended time."
5.0,yum!,I Love these! Great taste and soothes the tummy. This two pack was wrapped well and so far all the chews are very fresh.
5.0,Mi-Del ginger snaps,"These are absolutely the very best gluten free ginger snaps I have found. They are crunchy, not too sweet, and provide a great ginger burst"
1.0,if I could give 0 stars I would -,Buyer beware- do not sign up for subscribe and save unless you love this product. I have tried in vain to cancel this item since February of 2011. Yet Amazon continues to charge and ship a product I don't want.  The product doesn't taste good. Amazon is horrible to work with.
5.0,Yummy & Healthy,"I love this cereal.  I am always on the lookout for grocery items without corn & soy (allergens for me), and this cereal tastes great.  I am pleased with the wholesome ingredients. Also, this 6 pack is a great deal as I pay about $5 per box in my local grocery store."
1.0,"Tastes bad, clumps, not much calorie benefit.","It tastes bad.  And I use Splenda (sucralose) all the time, so I know the bad taste is not coming from the sucralose.  Also, it's very difficult to get this stuff to dissolve evenly in hot water.  I get clumps of it between my teeth even when I put it in a sealed container and shake it vigorously for a minute, or stir it wildly.  Finally, what makes it a ""sensible sweet?""  Compare the nutritional information to sugar sweetened Nestle hot cocoa mix:  ..............Total Calories.....Calories from Fat Nestle..............80...................25......... Swiss Miss........75...................15.........  Admittedly, the suggested serving size for Nestle is with 6oz of hot water while Swiss Miss is for 8oz of hot water.  But I've used both in a big 12oz coffee mug and I still find the Nestle is far superior to the Swiss Miss, even when diluted to half of it's recommended concentration.  The Nestle does contain real sugar AND corn syrup, yet the calories aren't highly different from the Swiss Miss.  The wretched taste and clumped mixture of the Swiss Miss should not be tolerated for such a small improvement in calories."
5.0,works terrific,"I've used these for 4 years. Just can't seem to get rid of fleas, but these work great. I use a few of them as I open my windows and no matter how tiny the holes in your screens are, they get in and also come in on my family as well. They work better at night when the house is dark as fleas tend to gravitate to the light. It's amazing how many they catch, one refill lasts a very long time as the surface is large compared to the size of a flea and it remains sticky. The only other alternative would be to bring my chickens in to take care of the problem, but then there's a different problem to deal with. If my town zoning law allowed my chickens to wander, my flea and tick problem would virtually disappear."
5.0,My favorite spice,This is the best spice I've ever used for my cooking. It used to be sold at Whole Foods. Now it seems to only be available here at Amazon.com. I'm happy as long as I can purchase it somewhere. Thanks!
1.0,Tasteless,"These cookies are not sweet at all, which is ok, but they also have NO flavor at all. They name is vanilla creme cookies- where is vanilla?? The texture is kind of strange too-cookie is crumbly, but around the creme it is crunchy. overall - will not be buying this product ever again."
1.0,"Good product, insane price","I second the review that I just read -- I just checked my recent sales slip from Trader Joe's, which indicated a price of $3.29 per carton for the 64-oz size,or just over $26 for 8 cartons. Even Wholefoods doesn't charge as much as the on-line company."
1.0,Wont Pop Properly,"We have gone through 4 bags in a row in the last 15 minutes and cannot get the popcorn to pop. Not even 25% of the popcorn is popped. We searched online and others are having the same problem, is it possible that all 4 bags are faulty?"
1.0,don't buy it!,"I wish I would have read the reviews! I thought the same thing that it was a box of 18 2-packs, but it was only 9 of them! way too pricey! at walmart you can buy these for about 9 bucks! And cheaper at sam's club! Live and learn! I feel robbed! I should have read the reviews before buying!"
1.0,Clover's limerick,"There once was a rabbit named Clover Sold by Amazon, over and over When they said he was fresh They did NOT mean his flesh Which would make a coyote* keel over  When I saw he was missing his head I surmised that old Clover was dead So I took out some cheese Which I melted with ease And served some Welsh rarebit instead  *pronounced kahy-OH-tee  Note: This item does not come with Amazon's easy-open packaging. It took me quite a while to find it hidden inside the shiny black top hat, even though the instructions stated quite clearly that it was a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.  In the end, I used the knife, in the kitchen.  Amanda Richards, August 31, 2010"
5.0,Very nice tea - great for the afternoon,I am a fan of most Twinings teas and bought the Traditional Afternoon not having tried it before. I was not disappointed.  I find it is a nice pick-me-up at work in the afternoon.  The only complaint I have is that it is not available in the US.
5.0,Love the vietnamese coffee filter set,"The stainless steel coffee filter works just great!  If you want a cup now and then thru the day, this filter is definitely worth EVERY penny.  Why fork over a hundred bucks for an electric maker?  (An environmental hog and more maintenance too.) And a cup can't taste any better than made in stainless steel, right?  Love it, and I will probably buy another for my friends to use at the same time when they want just a cup.  If you're into the simple joys in life, this will suit you JUST FINE!  Oh, did I mention it doesn't take up one inch of counter space either as I just grab it out of the cupboard and we're good to go?"
1.0,Not what I'd hoped,"I ordered this in multiple colors. It's not that glittery, and it becomes gummy upon contact with moisture... I think this stuff only works if you sprinkle it on and then immediately serve the dish. I used it as a decoration on top of a cheesecake, and within 30 minutes it had ""melted"" into a gooey substance - and the cheesecake had just come out of the refrigerator. Cute idea, poor execution.  Plus, for this silver color, the package came WITHOUT a safety seal of any kind - just unscrew the white top and the stuff comes pouring out. So I never even used the silver one - and it would have cost way more than the cost of the glitter to return it, so I just ""ate"" the cost."
1.0,Save Your Money!,"Even though convenient, the ""Hot Cocoa"" really isn't exactly what is says.  It is more like drinking colored water.  It really was so bad, that my partner tore open the cups and placed the powder in milk.  It took 2 k-cups to make one 10 ounce cup of cocoa.  It was okay then, but it's much easier to get some good ole` fashioned Hershey's chocolate and make a cup that I would just crave.  Besides, living close to Hershey, where the air constantly smells like milk chocolate, supports my local economy!"
1.0,Unacceptable,"The vendor, Penguin Mints, shipped these to me in a weird white box with tape wrapped around it.  These should have been in a sealed/unopened original Lindt box as depicted in the picture.  I can't give these away, I don't know if they have been tampered with or what."
5.0,Awesome product!,"This is an excellent product for the price.  I've checked out many health food stores and compared their product to this one based on ingredients and pricing and this by far is the best deal.  It's pleasant tasting and definitely helps in my health.  I have tested myself for acidity (many health issues) and I am so acid that I go off the range so I'm using this to help bring me into the area I need.  I have a long way to go but this seems to be boosting my energy levels etc.  Buy this one, it's great! blessings."
1.0,Disappointing,"Gritty texture, doesn't mix well, hemp bits get stuck in teeth. The package recommends adding it to yogurt but that turns the yogurt into a gritty inedible slop.  I'm afraid to use it in pancakes for fear it will result in grittiness. It's just a terrible excuse for ""protein powder"", I'm not sure it can called that."
5.0,Superb!,"I am very familiar with Rishi teas, though I'd never before sampled their Silver Needle Jasmine Loose Tea. This is one of the best white teas I've ever tried, and I've tried quite a few. Upon opening the container, you get a faint, intoxicating jasmine fragrance. This is an organic product with organic tea and jasmine blossoms. It's a delicate tea that for me needs no sweeteners whatsoever. It lacks bitterness, and it has a faint and very pleasing herbal/floral taste and aroma. The directions call for a steeping time of 4 to 5 minutes. I tried both, and prefer the 4-minute steeping time, which for me gives the tea a more subtle and ""mysterious"" flavor. It's actually a very sensual drinking experience! As is typical of white teas, they are very low in caffein, and high in antioxidants. I'm a big fan of all types of tea, and this silver needle jasmine white ranks as one of my favorites. Strongly recommended!"
1.0,Disgusting!,"I bought a bag, opened them, and almost threw up because of the overpowering rancid oil (and chemical?) smell!  Of course, I didn't dare eat one of the cookies, nor did I want to because I was so nauseous from the odor!  I couldn't even dispose of them in my kitchen trash can; I had to take them to the outdoor garbage can!  I wrote to the company in the hopes that they would rectify this situation with their quality control department. In all good conscience, I cannot give this product ANY stars!  [Amazon would not publish my review unless I gave them at least one star but I did so ONLY to get my review published.]"
5.0,Kitty Heaven,"Our cat goes completely insane for these treats -- her response is above and beyond anything else, ever, including fresh grown cat nip.  Her eyes turn into giant black spheres.  Totally worth it."
5.0,Good Iced Tea,If you like iced tea and lemonade mix then you need to try these K-cups!  They are not to sweet like some of the iced tea K-cups.  I use about 6-7 oz water and then fill my cup 1/2 full of ice when brewing.  I have a 2 qt pitcher I fill 1/2 with ice and I make 3 K-cups in a row and have a pitcher of ice tea ready in less then 10 minutes.
1.0,Not for Me,"I did not like these at all.  The price is too high in my opinion, too."
1.0,Tasted Gross,"The cans were in good condition and the green beans arrived on time... however... they taste horrible! I expected organic canned green beans to taste differently...  but I had no idea that they would taste differently in a bad way. Sorry, but definitely deserving a one star review."
1.0,PUT BACK THE TRANS FAT IDIOTS,"NABISCO I USED TO ENJOY THE SOCIAL TEA BISCUT FOR OVER 40 YEARS. BUT YOU DESTROYED THIS COOKIE WITH YOUR POLITICAL CORECTNESS, THANKS TO THAT JERK MIKE BLOOMBERG, TELLING YOUR COMPANY TO TAKE ALL TRANS FAT OUT OF YOUR COOKIE.  WELL PAL YOU LOST A CUSTOMER.  I WOULD RATHER EAT THE BOX, THAN THE NEW SOCIAL TEA COOKIE. YOU ARE JERKS JUST LIKE MIKE BLOOMBERG WITH HIS 20 BILLION DOLLARS. CONGRATUALTIONS, THE LITTLE GUY CANNOT EVEN ENJOY A COOKIE WITH HIS CUP OF COFFEE ANY MORE."
5.0,Terrific for picky dogs,"I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... ""dry"". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors."
1.0,What a waste,"I opened the bottle and use a little amount. I  placed the bottle in a cool, dark area for storage and the following week I went to use it and there was a nice gathering of mold in the neck of the bottle. I would like a return. I will than review the product and again and if it deserves a good rating, then so be it."
1.0,Beware,"I ordered one carton, and the company sent me three.  I didn't want 3 cartons!  If you try to return them, they will make you pay the shipping for the items you didn't order!! Moreover, the stuff is terrible because it doesn't stay mixed in the milk.  It separates into a gross layer on top.  What a waste of money!!"
1.0,Use cocoa from slave labor,"Lucy's cookies has a track record of buying cocoa from suppliers who use child labor to farm their cocoa beans, avoid this product if you have a conscience"
5.0,Cat Treats are Good !,My kitty loves these as a treat.  I am completely satisfied with these but next time I am going to buy the crunchy ones as opposed to these soft ones because the crunch helps clean the tartar off her teeth.
5.0,The best Assam in a bag,This is my all time favorite Assam tea (other than the kind I can find in London) and it seems to be hard to find in the stores. I am a very serious tea drinker and I love being able to buy it in bulk like this. Excellent find.
1.0,Horrible basket or gift,"I received the boxes wrapped in plastic to hold them in the tower and no ribbon the only thing that looks like the picture are the boxes but the arrangements I received are the perfect example of how something nice can look really ugly with no taste,  I bought 3 completely disappointed and I cant return them and Most likely I will keep just the boxes because I can't give this things as gifts to my friends,  UGLY UGLY UGLY."
5.0,Really great cereal,"I believe that those who bash the flavor of this product are generally used to eating processed products and have yet to acquire the taste of natural grains.  Once you learn how to eat healthier, it's amazing how most people learn how naturally sweet dry toast can be if its made with a really great bread or how wonderful this cereal is.  For my taste, I love this stuff andd I think it's worth every dime.  The boxes are always stuffed to capacity without the three or four inches of dead space chalked up as ""settling due to shipping and handling"".  I normally add it on top of a bowl of fresh fruit and yogurt and then listen to my co-workers tell me how great my breakfast or lunch looks.  Anyway, I highly recommend Food For Life Ezekiel cereal - its very difficult to find more nutrition in a single meal anywhere else!"
5.0,very good,"love this stuff :) its not available in the stores in my area, but this seller gets it right out and it arrives in no time."
5.0,For more than just baking,"As winter approaches, I feel moved to share one of my secrets for satisfying winter stews that are not excessively fatty. You can use the bitter tang and the concentrated flavor and fattiness of unsweetened chocolate to add a dimension to almost any stew that will delight ( and mystify ) your guests. For a two quart stew pot or brasier, add about two ounces of Bittersweet Scharffen Berger Chocolate and a tiny amount of hot pepper. Of course, this is not really a secret-Mole Poblano has used these ingredients for years. But some prejudiced connection of chocolate with dessert prevents us from using chocolate as a spice. Why Scharffen Berger? Here's a story:  My European friends are mildly snooty about some of their local products-all of which, in their eyes-are infinitely superior to their American equivalents. A few years ago, I started carrying Scharffen Berger chocolate bars with me to Europe-mostly the blue and yellow wrappers. At one friend's house, I was always asked to make a mousse au chocolate and so I, naturally, used the Scharffen Berger even though my host had put out a local (Austrian) brand. The rave reviews that the mousse got-and continues to get- are not based on the recipe, which is basic basic, but on the remarkable complexity of these lovely chocolates and particularly on their fruity overtones and beguiling winey finish. I hear that the company has been sold to Hershey, and so there is no guarantee that the quality will remain as it is. For the moment, I have to say that I think this is certainly one of the three best chocolates in the world and maybe the best.  --Lynn Hoffman, wine writer New Short Course in Wine,The and the rich and velvety bang BANG: A Novel which has decidedly spicy notes of its own."
1.0,"Great idea, badly implemented","I like the test and convenience of these Folgers bags, but about half of them are defective. Yes, the bags are not keeping the coffee in because they are not well sealed. This completely gives away the ""convenience."" Great idea bad implemented. I regret I bought 6 boxes of this product."
1.0,Our Juniper Bonsai Tree died.,"I had purchased the Juniper Bonsai Tree as a Christmas present for my husband.  By last month, April 2010, it was dead.  I would like to know how do I get a replacement for it from the people we bought it from.  I can't remember who we bought it from.  Otherwise I will not get another Bonsai tree. How do I find out where I purchased it from?  Thank you,  Diana McLemore"
5.0,Nice and handy for grab and go.,If you like graham crackers but don't like the mess of having to open up an entire packet then this is for you.  These fresh stacks are perfect to grab as an on the go snack or pack in a lunch.  Since the fresh stacks are smaller amounts you don't have to worry about opening up a huge pack to take a few out and having the rest go stale.  These are a no brainer purchase if you are going to be buying graham crackers.
1.0,not sealed enough,"When i opened the package the box was wet, so i figured out why it was wet, i found it came form the spam can, the can was not sealed enough, and i guess its not healthy to eat it, but i already opened one can, wonder if i can return the remaining cans,the expiration is year 2014 but i guess it will only last maybe few days since the can wasnt not sealed enough."
5.0,very tasty tea indeed!,"I'm a bit of a tea junky- not a snob by any means, but I know when a tea offers a lot of flavor- and this is certainly it. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who, perhaps, doesn't like ginger- because the ginger can be a bit more overpowering than the orange.  Still, it's a great evening drink, as it is naturally decaffeinated. (makes me want to run to the kitchen and make some right now!) It has a nice aroma and the tea flavor is pretty mellow. Each tea bag is individually sealed in it's own foil bag- so each bag stays very fresh until use. And the seller? Well, my order came pretty quickly, the tea was well packaged (no dents, etc) in the box. No complaints. As I mentioned- I'm a bit of tea freak- with probably 8-10 different kinds in my pantry at all times. I'm ordering my next two boxes now, because I don't think I can live without this tea! If you like ginger, orange and tea- this is a nice addition to your stock."
5.0,Two Paws Up!,"Howie devoured this product without hesitation, and he is one badly spoiled cat.  Included in the box was a sample of a freeze-dried product that he most definitely did not like.  Delivery took about a week.  If you have a spoiled, finicky cat, and don't mind spending the money, this is worth a try."
5.0,Great tasting coffee,"We lived in Hawaii for a few years.  Have been searching for Kona or Maui coffe.  We live in secluded area, so have been ordering on line.  Not too much acid.  Great tasting."
5.0,Best GF Flour on Market!!,"I've tested a lot of flours, including mixing my own.  Bob's tastes like lentils because he uses garbanzo bean flour in his mix (seriously, everything will end up tasting like beans).  Pamela's is okay, but a little gritty.  Most flours end up gritty because of the rice flour in them.  Beth's Flour by Gluten-Free Pantry is the BEST!  I can make any recipe from any cookbook by substituting her flour for gluten ones.  It is not gritty and actually tastes like ""real"" flour!  The only problem is that GF Pantry may be discontinuing it because it is becoming more difficult to find on the market.  Sad.  Please try this flour!  You won't be disappointed!"
1.0,Poor quality tea and very cheap packaging,"I found this tea to be weak and bitter. Also, all the tea bags, which are in gimmicky triangled shaped tea bags are packed loose in the cardboard box so there's a bunch of loose tea in the bottom of the box. Accordingly, to keep it fresh, one needs to put the bags into an airtight canister or zip lock bag. To have 240 tea bags packed loosely in a cardboard box is just simply poor packaging. The tea arrived somewhat stale and even if it had not, it would have become stale in short order.  I see this has received a lot of positive reviews. I've not read them and my review is not influenced by them in anyway. I would never buy this tea again and could not in good conscience recommend it. Perhaps I'm picky but there are too many really good black teas available to, in my humble opinion, ever give this product consideration."
1.0,OMG ITS SO GROSS!,"Im so bummed, I was soooo excited about this, I love cider, and I love My kcups, HOWEVER, this tastes NOTHING like apple cider, at all. I even went with caramel for extra sweet, and its horrible, it has THE WORST aftertaste. Most of all, it sucks even more because it cant be returned or exchanged. Seriously... buy it for your worst enemy."
5.0,"Delicious, Organic, Fast Delivery, Family Owned",The title says it all.  We are very pleased with the flavor (Grade B) and the price is excellent.  It was delivered promptly and I'll order again without hesitation.
5.0,Nice flavor and good packaging,"I appreciate that Gloria Jeans is available in this ""frustration free"" packaging. At first I was surprised that the little K Cups were rolling around loosely in a big box, but then I realized that all that extra packaging to make them in boxes of 18 or 24 was unnecessary. How many people leave them in the box anyway? I always unload the cups in to my own storage boxes and coffee caddy. The Hazelnut flavor is one of our favorites. It has a nice strong note even diluted with milk and sugar. The price is always a good deal, especially with the free shipping. Always check Amazon for the best deal!"
1.0,Not rice,This product is not rice it is pasta  cut  short to look like rice and the flavor is not good so plan on adding your own spices.
1.0,I was CHEATED....!!!!!!,"BEWARE the changing descriptions here in Amazon folks...when I first viewed this item, admittedly a convenient item to have in the pantry for a snowy day, the descriptions was for THIRTY-TWO (32) 1 quart (32-oz) cartons for around $33...NOT 12 cartons as the description NOW reads. I thought a dollar per carton was a pretty good price, but I NEVER would have ordered it at almost 3 dollars a carton...that's highway robbery.  I am going to complain to Amazon, don't expect to get any satisfaction, but will try anyway.  So be careful: anytime something here in Amazon sounds too good to be true it probably is."
1.0,DO NOT BUY,This is probably some of the worst tasting waters I have ever tried. It almost tastes like something spoiled. Do not buy this at any price. What a complete waste of money.I wish there were minus ratings.
5.0,Remember When a Skull on the Label Meant DON'T Drink the Contents?,"Not anymore, apparently.  Offhand, the only other place I can remember seeing skulls on the labels of beverages is in the Rotgut Industry.  But this is hardly the first case of counter intuitive marketing in energy drinks:  Monster Energy Drink cans  have claw marks slashed through their label,  Venom Energy Drink cans  have a poisonous snake on their label, and  Cocaine Energy Drink - As Strong As 3 Red Bulls  and  Zombie Blood Energy Potion Pack  pretty much speak for themselves.  (What next?  This Will Kill You brand energy drinks?)  Which is a bit ironic since No Fear brand energy drinks could argue that they are a little bit more healthy (or a little bit less UNhealthy) than the average energy drink because they contain grape juice concentrate.  How much is unclear, but from the label we can know that there is less grape juice concentrate than the taurine (1000mg) but more than the inositol (100mg).  Oh, it is hardly what I would call genuine ""Soda Juice"":  IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice ,  essn Sparkling Juice , or  The Switch Carbonated Juice , but this probably explains the different and IMHO surprisingly good taste.  Note: Also available in  No Fear, Sugar Free, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) ."
1.0,dangerous treat,"I have been giving my dog this treat for a long time,I found it here on Amazon and it is much cheaper! Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of ""made in USA"", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend."
1.0,"wow, not what i expected at all!","I have been eating this stuff for 30+ year.  This is not Li Hing Mui, maybe its white people's version. The taste and the flavor is not their.  Tried one seed from both bags and threw the rest in the trash....If Li Hing Mui was part of your childhood, stay away.  If not, you should be ok.  Sorry, just the truth........"
5.0,I scream for Ice Cream!,WOW!!! Arctic Zero is so good-what a fantastic taste! and I didn't feel guilty eating the whole pint or feeding it to my 3 year old who kept asking for more.
5.0,Excellent.,This is just as good a I get in gas station. Love the ease of having it brewed in my house.
1.0,hmmmm,It's a great cake moist and rummy!!! But when it got to me it was moldyy I had it before for Christmas from a gift basket this time I ordered it through amazon and it came in moldyy I had to throw it away what a tragic waste!
1.0,not so much...,"my stats:  male, 40, east coast born.  i remember Marathon Bars as a child and how AWESOME they were....years ago they stopped making them so i did a little research and came across this bar which bills itsself as a proper replacement.  no its not. its MUCH smaller, the caramel is MUCH tougher and the chocolate is alot cheaper (not to mention it arrived old and out of date)  so....if you are looking for a replacement bar...its just not made....but if you are looking for stale, old chocolate bars which take forever to receive in the mail....this is for you!!!!  the positive reviews here have to come from the manufacturer...no way any sane person would think these are similar...if you notice the reviews (like i fell for) you can kinda tell."
1.0,Doesn't Begin To Compare With the Real Thing,"I usually buy Pu-erh tea at a store about 40 miles away, it comes in an orange box for less than 1/4 of the price of this (per pound). I haven't been able to get to that store for a while, and was having Pu-erh withdrawal, so I decided to try this. I don't know if this isn't aged, if it comes from inferior trees, or it's something else in how it's processed (or a combination of all of them), but this doesn't even begin to compare with the wonderfully complex and slightly pungent ""real"" Pu-erh that I've been drinking for the last twenty or so years. A real disappointment, I hope that Amazon gets the ""real"" product from China for sale someday - until then, I guess I've got a drive to take."
5.0,mars,Mars candy bars are an old time favorite. Chocolate covered caramel with nougat and whole almonds.  Never understood why they are no longer available nationwide.
1.0,"Not ""All Natural""","Read the packages carefully before buying.  Cadet is known for ""irradiating"" their products.  That is not ""all natural.""  Our holistic vet advises to never feed irradiated or ""high-pressure pasturised"" products to animals.  It's not worth the risk and it definitely puts more toxic junk into their systems.  Merrick is not great either.  They own their own rendering plant in TX.  Road kill; euthanized pets; diseased, dead, dying, and downed animals are allowed and included in rendered meats and by-products."
1.0,Very Disappointing,Save your money. Go buy yellow or white popcorn from your local grocery store (under a $1.00 a lb.). They are charging $4.80 a pound here. I found two of the three verities they are selling here are no more than yellow and white popcorn which cost less than $1.00 a lb. at your local grocery store. Their third verity here the 'Purple' has no significant different taste or flavor than yellow or white popcorn. Popcorn is popcorn after being popped. Also save your money on their caramel topping. You are just buying brown sugar. They are charging ($11.58) for a 10 oz. jar of what amounts to brown sugar. A 2 lb. bag of brown sugar is around $2.00 at your local grocery store. By the way brown sugar a very good popcorn topping in my opinion.  As good as I have found. So there you are. My opinion for what it's worth.
5.0,Same great formula at an awesome price,"This endorsement is mainly for the Amazon subscription program. We get the same great formula from Similac at an awesome price. I really like the subscription program because we get the formula delivery like clock-work. I don't have to make a run to Babies 'R Us anymore to lug around all of those cases, and save on overall price.  We are subscribing with Amazon for items that need regular refills. This is a great program!"
5.0,You'll never go back,"When you have tried these flavorful, distinct gummi bears, you'll never go back to the rubbery, standard flavors and textures you've tried before. These are without peer."
5.0,Great Coffee!!,"I am a coffee snob.  I drink a cup or two every day.  Folgers, Maxwell House, these are four letter words in my home.  I was buying the archer farms coffee at Target.  This stuff is just as good and much cheaper at around 8 bucks a pound, the smell of it is so phenomenal, and it carries over to the taste.  It works well as ice coffee, espresso, and drip coffee.  I have yet to make it as vacuum coffee, but that is always the best.  Totally recommend this coffee."
5.0,Crispy & Fresh,"Purchased directly from Amazon. I was glad to find these here, since my grocery store no longer stocks it. I ordered this in March 2012 and it has a September 2012 expiration. Plenty fresh, since I found my local store used to also have about 6-8 months on the expiration as well. The price was also comparable to what you'd pay anywhere else, so that's nice.  My crispbread arrived with minimal padding in the box but it was completely intact. No broken pieces. I was worried they'd be a crumbly mess, based on an earlier review, but maybe I got lucky. I break them up anyway, so they'll fit in a ziplock bag, so I figured, no biggie either way.  I prefer Siljans to all the other brands/styles of crispbread. It's made from 100% rye and it has a nutty flavor and crispy texture. It's not a heavy rye flavor, more like a wonderfully crispy piece of wheat toast. Fat free, with a good amount of fiber and protein per serving. I like to use it as a low-cal snack when I'm looking for something crunchy to munch on. I pretty much stopped buying sandwich bread and use the crispbread instead for sandwiches and whatnot. Good stuff =)"
5.0,Fragrant Black Cardamom,"This is the first time that I have ordered from this site and I am very impressed. The cardamom that I ordered are beautiful and the 8 oz. jar is really a lot. They are so fragrant and wonderful in my cooking.  I also ordered purple sticky rice and it is very nice, too.  Her prices are very good; I do a lot of comparative shopping. I will be buying from this source again!"
5.0,Delicious Robust Flavor,"This spice is really delicious. It is not terrifically hot, but it ads a little heat and a lot of flavor. I added it to a mushroom alfredo dish and it gave it a beautiful color and flavor. Its a little pricey so using it as an on the plate addition makes it go farther."
5.0,My dog loves these!,"These are my dog's absolute favorite treat. Wish they were still on ""Subscribe and Save"""
1.0,"Sunscreen, or maybe plastic","Wish I'd thought to check reviews before buying this, since there seems to be a consensus. This stuff is a far cry from horchata. It has a dull, chemical, plastic taste. My wife says it ""tastes like sunscreen,"" which is spot-on except for the mouthfeel: sunscreen is rich and creamy, and this is just watery.  In its defense, the powder smells great. I'll try repurposing it as potpourri."
1.0,Not what I ordered!,I ordered decaf hazelnut k-cups from Gloria Jean (that's what I clicked on) what came in the mail was non-decaf (regular) I cannot drink regular coffee. I was dismayed to see they were not returnable. If it were not for Amazon's wonderful policy (they refunded me anyway!) I would be stuck with coffee I could not use. This is why I order 90% of my online purchases from Amazon. I will go back to Paul Newman decaf k-cups. They arrive as ordered.
5.0,I can't make it any better from scratch.,"I've made my own bread for the past 40+ yrs and potato bread was as close to plain white bread as I ever got. I loved making it, loved eating it and loved knowing it was made from scratch with quality ingredients for my family (a husband and 5 kids) . Now after years of illness, I just cant do it all myself. I have trusted Bob's Red Mill for many years for the healthy ingredients in my breads so it was only natural that I turned to them for a bread mix to make life easier for me now. It's so easy to make in my food processor and I can have fresh bread in less time than finding a ride to the grocery store! And for less money, too!  This dough is also great for rolls. The other day I made piroskies and they were awesome!"
5.0,What a treat!,We were first introduced to these by a friend who'd bought them for her dog.  Our dog loves them!  I like that they're natural and low fat.  Ordering them in a 6-pack is convenient...this is my second order.  A quality product at a good price.
5.0,It's not Christmas without it . . .,"We grew up with another brand and I decided to take the plunge with Ferrara and try it.  Upon opening the top (which is a lift up flap) the blue colored boxes were all lined up.  There are vanilla, orange and lemon flavors.  I tried the vanilla.  Opened the little box and inside was a sealed metallic bag which held the goody.  It was a good size, for Torrone, and upon the first bite the rice paper wafer was fresh, the nougat was sweet but not sickeningly and the almonds were toasted and crisp.  Then the childhood memories flooded in - I'm sitting at the long, dining table with the credenza behind me and I'm facing the front window looking out at a winter day. The women in the kitchen doing dishes and cleaning up after a huge meal, the Italian chatter ebbs and flows, the men watching the Christmas sports in the other room, and me sneaking the first tastes of Torrone enjoying bite after bite of the delicate goodness.  Memories in a box and this brand didn't fail."
5.0,Good product,"This product tastes great..just like the real thing, minus the fat and calories. You should try it!  Dr. Oz even says so!"
1.0,Sticks and Twigs is an accurate description,"A prior reviewer stated ""you won't be able to eat just one"". I think they meant ""you'll barely be able to eat them""  I'm a curry lover and purchased the curry flavor from a local store. It is really hard to describe these, but they truly are quite unpleasant. Nobody in the house will eat them. They are rock hard, and I can only imagine that a handful of bird seed with some curry powder would taste the same. Given the price difference between bird seed and these, I know which I would purchase if I wanted a similar experience in the future."
5.0,Fabulous Flavoring,"I love coffee, and I like cream.  But, some creams seem ""sissy"" to me.  However, the Carmel Macchiato is ""manly"" enough for me to get.  Seriously, whether you are a male or female, these are awesome, and at a good price.  You'll like it."
1.0,coffee syrup,I did not like the Da Vinci sugar free pumpkin syrup at all.  It leaves a strange after taste and more closely tastes like a fermented fruit flavor.
5.0,Super Cravable!,All natural AND Delicious!  I have tried every flavor and love them all.  Very different from your other flavored peanut butters. I highly suggest trying them (:
1.0,yuck,Most of the packages were no longer vacumn sealed.  The coffee did not taste very good.  That goes for the regular also. I think it was laying around a warehouse for a while.  Joe and Bea
5.0,Best rumcake ever!,"This is the best rum cake!  I got some in Grand Cayman when I went on a cruise several years ago.  My favorite is the original flavor, but the variety pack is awesome for trying a little of every flavor.  Highly recommended!"
5.0,This stuff works,I'm an ER doctor and work long hours - sometimes day shifts and sometimes night shifts. I've always struggled with finding something healthy I could take to stay awake. Coffee tends to give me heartburn and the 5 hour energy drinks don't do anything for me. One of my friends gave me one of these pills to try and I was AMAZED. Literally right after taking it I felt more alert. It lasted for about ten hours and then I was able to sleep without feeling a crash. I was more social/friendly and just felt like my eyes were more open/aware. I could do my job better. I've never had anything like this before. Needless to say I bought a bottle and shared it with all the people I work with and they're all hooked. I haven't heard a single person say it doesn't work for them. I don't know where this stuff came from but it's the real deal.
1.0,unhappy,The bonsai I got looked nothing like the one I ordered.  I was very unhappy when I paid for something that I didn't want.
5.0,Great product,"Bil Jacs are fanastic treats.  If you keep them in a zip loc bag, they stay moist, and are perfect for smooshing into Kongs or shin bones or other treat holders.  I've never had my dog refuse Bil Jac, and she is very picky!  It's a great product and not expensive."
1.0,cheap but all oil has been extracted,I use a lot indian spices and i bought i pound bag. it is cheap and all oil has been extracted. A lot of it has be used to get good taste.
1.0,Agree 100% with other reviews,"Have used Betty Crocker Potato Buds for years. Grabbed a box off the shelf recently and didn't  notice that they had changed the product until I went to make them last night. Well, they are terrible compared to the old version. I told my husband that now I will have to try and find a different brand to use. I much prefer homemade mashed, but like to have boxed on hand for emergencies. Did a web search and found Honest Earth All Natural Mashed potatoes on Amazon none the less! The reveiws are GREAT and I will be placing an order for them. Betty Crocker, like the other reviewers, you just lost my business."
5.0,Do NOT get me near these!,I ordered some of these and literally ate them each day through all 24 packs.  They are addicting and delicious.
5.0,Yum!,This product was provided to me for free through Influenster. My family love these cookies. They are soft and slightly chewy. My 2 yr old will only eat these oatmeal cookies. So he really enjoyed them.
1.0,Not reccomended!,"I have made several passes at cooking, different times etc. results are terrible. Tastes like paper mache!  Sorry that I ordered a case. Fettuccine is fine, haven't tried spaghetti yet."
5.0,Satisfied,I've been looking for the orange mint candy for awhile.  This product was available at some stores but then it was nowhere to be found.  I had to order it via Amazon.  I really like the taste and my co-workers enjoy it too. It's a change from the wintergreen and peppermint flavor.
1.0,Bad,"Bought it at the drugstore after Heidi convinced me to on tv. I was really disappointed but I should have known better, great things rarely come with a price tag of $4...maybe it's just my hairs chemistry did not mesh well with whatever is in this shampoo but it dried it out so bad. I do have highlighted hair but pretty damn healthy thanks to joico and redeken. It made my hair elasticy and when I would come after the shower my hair was literally stretching. I used for about a week and then I put in the cabinet to use for the dogs."
1.0,Why mess with a good thing?,"These chips used to be amazing: like nothing else on the market.  I could go through a bag a day all by myself.  They were insanely delicious.  The only minor issue was that a certain amount of the spices they used to flavor them would collect at the bottom of the bag.  So, they decided to ""improve"" them by reformulating (i.e. changing) the spice mixture so that it would adhere better to the chips.  STUPID!!!  Now, instead of tasting like a product in a class by itself, they taste like a second-rate Doritos.  Unless you have a wheat allergy, there's no longer any really compelling reason to buy these chips as they now taste like any other product on the market.  It's really sad.  I rarely write reviews for anything, but I was so disappointed by this, I just had to mention it.  Why do companies always have to ruin a good thing?  I mean, I'm sure I should thank them for the sake of my hips, but my taste buds are still in mourning."
5.0,Great cereal,"This cereal is delicious with skim milk and frozen blueberries! After adding the blueberries let it sit for one minute to slightly thaw, yum!"
5.0,This price has to be wrong!,Anyone can purchase Virgil's Zero Real Cola for less than $1.50 each and a four pack for less than $5.00 at most health food stores or grocery stores. I give one star to the seller for this price and hope they correct this ridiculous price and I give the cola itself five stars plus. This cola has NO artificial sweetener. Only fat people drink diet drinks with artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners WILL make you fat.
1.0,I really think they sholud have a 1/2 star,These were shipped later than the Chocolate ones so I thought these couldn't be any worse than the chocolate...WRONG..These are horrible! Dry in your mouth and add any liquid..milk? coffee? and these turn to the consistancy of sawdust.  Truely disgusting..never again..Usually my products from Amazon are good..so I was really disappointed.
5.0,Delicious and unique,"I have only recently discovered ""unprocessed"" honey, and I cannot begin to describe what a difference there is between real, untreated honey and the stuff that is commercially available in those little plastic bears in the grocery store.  It's light night and day.  I never used to like honey, but this has become one of my favorite foods, and is an excellent alternative to sugar or artificial sweeteners in tea.  It has a very rich texture, with a mouthfeel that is different from regular honey (more granular, but not in a bad or distracting way).  It also has a subtle floral, honeysuckle taste on top of the overall sweetness.  The only issue that I had with this honey is that initially there was a thin layer (~1/4 inch) at the top of the jar that was reminiscent of marshmallow fluff, and was disappointing in both flavor and texture. I'm assuming this is just normal separation, either scooping this part off or just making sure to thoroughly mix the jar before eating would probably eliminate this problem."
1.0,CERTIFIED ORGANIC CRAP!!!!!,"My cat has a box that he lounges in, and that is where I sprinkle his catnip. I put some in the box as usual, he sniffed the nip, and then lay on the floor OUTSIDE OF THE BOX. He hates this crap. I hate this crap. If I could give this nip negative stars, I would.  Stick w/ Cosmic Catnip, is my advice."
1.0,Don't buy this food--for your cat's health,"As others have also mentioned, my cat got struvite crystals and this was the primary food he was given. He needed emergency surgery to clean out his bladder, and it was awful to see him suffering. I too bought this because it was listed as one of the best on the market, and both my cats were eating it but one of them nearly died because of this diet. After talking with others that had pets with bladder blockage problems, some indicate that the name ""Wellness"" in often association. I can't help but think that his ailment must have something to do with this food. While I can't say it was THE cause because my other cat didn't get sick, this certainly didn't prevent it and was most of his diet. I am switching to a wet or canned diet for my cat, and I am definitely not using this brand ever again. And I don't think you should risk it.  Also, I hope others who have this experience will write reviews because a food that charges a premium for its purported high quality shouldn't have such terrible effects on any pets--even if it is just a marginal amount."
5.0,Surprisingly tasty,"We are not gluten free but my MIL is.  I bought this to have on hand when she came out for a visit...  and then never got around to making it.  We just made it recently to use it up and get it out of here, expecting mediocrity at best...  but it was surprisingly tasty!  It had a bouncy, springy texture.  We ate the entire loaf at one meal (with bean soup, which I keep wishing my kids would like, but they won't...  so they ate a lot of bread...) so I can't attest to its keeping qualities, but fresh from the oven it was great.  It smelled AWFUL raw so I was skeptical, but smelled good baking and tasted great.  I think I will keep a bag or two around now just as a way to have easy fresh baked bread for dinner.  And maybe one of these days my kids will learn to like bean soup.  My husband did the actual mixing, as far as I know he followed the directions exactly.  I may try some of the tweaks suggested next time.  It does call for an odd amount of eggs, that would be the only complaint."
1.0,obscenely over priced,"This coffee is obscenely overpriced.  I just got my order and it has an expiration date of Aug, 12, 2011, just short of a year past date.  I must say, though, that this flavor is the best of all of the flavored Via coffees.  Starbucks quit making it last year-----BIG MISTAKE.  I guess I should have realized it would be old product.  Dale Carlson"
5.0,Supreme Service,I knew the product and liked it enough to order it online! It was the service and attention that really were outstanding. I highly recommend the sauce and the seller!
5.0,One Treat My Dogs Really Love,"I found these quite reasonably priced here at Amazon.  I have two golden retrievers who I spoil and have been buying these treats for a few years.  They like bones and I like the added feature of chicken with them (obviously the dogs like the chicken too).  Last time I bought these I bought a few jars as with two dogs and me giving them one every time they come in, they don't last long.  Thanks Amazon for a good price on these when there was a special."
1.0,Inconsistent and Poor Quality,"I've tried the peppered, spicy, and original.  There is a lot of inconsistency between packages.  The last batch I bought was the original flavor, and it has a very chewy, unpleasant texture.  No flavor, unpleasant aftertaste.  The smell is awful, it smells like a dog treat.  Some pieces have a bunch of gristle attached.  The only redeeming quality is that the jerky is not loaded with MSG, but I just can't stomach the stuff anymore."
5.0,I LOVE THIS!!!!,"Oh Arizona ... I used to weigh 315 pounds, wore a size 48 waist, 3XL shirt, had diabetes, slept with a sleep apnea machine, took diabetic medicine (metformin and glucofage), took trazadone to help me sleep, gabapentin (pain medication for my knees) had high blood pressure and took medicine for it. I drank nothing but sodas and ate crap all my life. At age 39 I decided I wanted to be ""Fit by 40."" I started May 13, 2010 and my goal was to be healthy by the time I reached 40 on March 14, 2011. I stopped drinking soda and eating crap. I started exercising and drinking water, but plain water wasn't doing it for me. I tried all sorts of different drinks until I found Arizona Sugar Free Lemon Iced Tea. One sip and I honestly fell in love with it. I started buying it at my local Publix and Kroger, but couldn't get anymore as they said it was discontinued! I cringed at the thought of drinking other stuff. Blech. I finally contacted the Arizona company and they told me about Amazon's service. I quickly signed up for it and every month, I get a 4 pack (24 tubs) of this yumminess! OMG. I love Arizona and Amazon.  One taste and you will love this stuff. And if not, email me and I will buy the rest from you! :)  BTW - today is April 20, 2010 ... My 40th birthday was 5 weeks ago. I now weigh in at 186 pounds, wear a size 32 pants and medium/large shirt, sold my sleep apnea machine, dumped all my other meds and I only take vitamins in the morning! ! I feel healthy as a horse!"
1.0,Genuinely nasty stuff,"I'm sure this was intended for hard cases who want to pretend they are drinking real cocktails but this is a weak effort.  It does indeed remind one of margarita mix, the nasty commercially made chemical laden stuff served cheap mexican restaurants.  Obviously Crystal Light is a 100% artificial product but it does not need to taste this bad.  OTOH, if you like choking down weak bad margaritas without the benefit of getting a buzz then have at it."
1.0,One of the worst things I've ever eaten,"Simply Awful. When I first saw this and I thought mhh, seems like a good buy, an upgrade from ramen noodles. Wrong! These noodles are thick and disgusting. If I had to say something ever tasted like a dirty Sock, This Would Be IT!!! When you microwave these noodles, they go from looking semi edible, to completely rancid. I wish I could go back and return this but I don't think I have that option. I'm not sure how the other flavors taste but I'd suggest staying away from this one. P.S I also feel sick right now after eating it. Wish me luck, might be sick and vomiting from this in a bit."
1.0,If you like generic coffee...,"then this isn't for you. Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee, this isn't the one to try."
5.0,delish,Best packaged gravy on the market. Tastes just like homemade. Turkey and beef are also good. Lifesaver for a friend who needed it for 60 guests at Thanksgiving.
5.0,Good Seller,The coffee came quickly and in perfect condition. Good seller. We mix this coffee with regular coffee to scale back our caffeine intake.All decaf coffee gives my husband a headache. This one doesn't so it seems to be working. And it tastes good with our other coffee.
1.0,Where's the Crab - A Real Disappointment,Friends of ours recommended this soup.  What a disappointment.  It is a an unmemorable  cream soup.  The picture on the can is misleading.  If you look at the picture you would expect it to be full of chunky goodness.  Instead you find a cream soup which is condensed and when reconstituted is a notch below the famous brand name Cream of Mushroom.  There is no chunky goodness.  As a matter of facts the only chunks you might find are parts of the soup which have fully not blended.  Might use it in recipes that call for a cream soup.  Certainly expected more at over $3 a can.
1.0,Too weak!,"While brewing, this coffee smells wonderful.  But it is the weakest coffee I've ever tasted that was made by me.  I prefer a medium to strong cup of coffee and so put in the same amount of this coffee that I do for other coffee.  First pot was like drinking water.  For the second pot, I doubled the amount of coffee I had put in for the first pot and it was still too weak.  I'll try mixing it with a stronger coffee, but I fear I'll just have to throw this coffee away. Stay away from this brand if you like your coffee to taste like coffee."
5.0,This Makes the BEST Popcorn,"I don't know what I can add to other reviews, but this is the missing ingredient I was looking for to make movie theater style popcorn at home.  It's the real deal!!!  I put some of this oil into my Stir Crazy popper, add some Flavasol and the popcorn and oh my goodness -- the popcorn is out of this world.  The price is fabulous and the product comes carefully packaged.  What are you waiting for???  Order this now so you, too, can eat the best popcorn at home."
5.0,Excellent!,"Excellent.  If you remember the ""Forever Yours"" bar, this is the same thing only from Milky Way.  The dark chocolate is tempered by the sweet, white milky way filling.  I don't like dark chocolate but this combination is phenomenal!"
1.0,maltese owner,these are beef LUNGS...they are light and airy but did not agree w/my maltese digestive system so i gave them away.  stick w/smokehouse beefy sticks.
5.0,Puroast Low Acid Vanilla Decaf Coffee,This isn't as good as regular coffee and it's hard to detect any vanilla flavoring but it's been a godsend for me nonetheless.  It has allowed me to drink coffee again and I'm very grateful.  It took a little while to get used to it because it is quite different from non-low acid coffee but now I really enjoy it and will continue to buy it.  I just wish it were available locally and that I could buy a cup of this in a coffee shop.
1.0,Product damage,I love True Lemon but my recent purchase from Amazon through a second party was a totally unsatisfactoy. It arrived a gummy mess. Could't use it. Merchant didn't make good.
1.0,Read and read well.,"If one reads this products ingredients they will find that the first ingredient is cows milk, then SUGAR (diabetic maker), then milk, again. The fourth ingredient is sunflower oil, fifth ingredient is maltodextrin which is starch produced from grain containing the sugars maltose and dextrin, with the seventh ingredient being, get this, tuna fish oil. They even feature vitamin D3, which is animal derived. There are four different sugar sources in it and some artificial flavor for good measure. If we really think about what we are feeding our babies, would we use this product? I know I wouldn't. Know your food sources."
5.0,great iced or hot,This coffee has a distinct flavor and aroma. Perfect mix of chocolate and rasberry. Raspberry is a natural flavor. It is great even made as a larger cup serving over ice.
5.0,Very pleased,"Nothing negative to say about this buying experience.  My dog loves Greenies, and this was a better price than what I have seen elsewhere.  Treats like this, along with regular dental care (brushing her teeth and getting her teeth professionally cleaned by a vet) means that my dog's breath is nice and she is healthier.  My dog is 7kgs (around 15 lbs)and this is a perfect size for her.  The packaging keeps these treats fresh - inside the box is an airtight resealable bag."
5.0,the best cat food!!,"This is the only dry cat food my picky cat will eat. Plus the vet said his teeth are looking better now that he has been eating it, when I adopted him he had bad tartar/plaque and early gum disease. He has much less hairballs now too! My younger cat eats mostly this dry food. My older cat still prefers his canned food but always saves room for this too."
1.0,Yeee-uck,"I got these snacks when I was searching for the Veggie Straws.  They LOOKED tasty.  However, I didn't care for the consistency.  Since they are called ""crisps"" I assumed they would be crunchy...like chips.  But instead they dissolve in your mouth...kind of like party mints.  I cancelled my subscription and gave the packages that I had to someone else to try.  Lesson learned."
5.0,Fresh 'N Clean Pet Cologne,I have used this for several years now.  It keeps my babies fresh and clean smelling.  Actually I think it lasts longer than that used at my groomer.
1.0,I did not like these at all!!!,"I decided to try multiple Hormel products when the sale made their price reasonable but I found many of the products to be just HORRIBLE!  This particular Chicken and Noodle is a bowl of salt with hard, thick noodles and a few little pieces of chicken.  They do give lots of sauce though!  I love sauce but ended up spitting out the noodles because they were just awful.  And though I love salt....this product was mostly salt.  I ended up giving all but the one I tried to eat to the local food bank.  I do feel guilty about that but I am sure someone might like this product.  I will never buy this product again and I do not recommend it to anyone.  Buy it at your own risk!!"
1.0,Didn't work !,I read the instructions ! Put the poll - try to make the dog pee around the POLL Nothing ! Didn't work ! Not good for me !
1.0,Horrible,I purchased these after seeing it on the Dr. Oz show.  They are horrible gross I will never buy again.
1.0,A Great Laxative,"The taste is OK but stay away from these unless you want to spend some time on the pot. Within 30 - 45 minutes of ingesting I am on the pot in intestinal misery. I do not know what they use as a sweetener but it IS NOT Splenda. I use Splenda DAILY and it never effects me like these do. Go for it if you want to dump your guts but if you want jelly beans go with the regular ones. If your diabetic and want these.....just eat at home, make sure you have no plans for later and see that the bathroom is free."
1.0,Coffee beans were stale and flavorless,"Coffee was not vacuum sealed. Did not have that fresh coffee aroma which I would expect when I opened the bag. When I brewed it, the coffee tasted like dirt. Tried twice with different grinds and strengths, but there was no hope for it. Stale, flavorless garbage."
5.0,Kitty chow my fusspot kitten actually eats,"I adopted a three month-old kitten from a rescue group on Christmas Eve. I think -- no, I am certain -- they fed her either home made kitten food (ie: table food) or just gave her table scraps because she certainly was not acclimated to kitten food from the can.  To get her to learn to eat kitten food canned, I must have tried at least 18 brands, ranging from every high end (expensive) to the low-brow Friskie in the store. She picked at all. But when I made my dinner she was very expectant, as though saying, ""now it's time for dinner!"" I believe the worst thing people can do is give domesticated animals people food, no matter how they rationalize that it is ""healthier."" Dogs and cats have been domesticated for centuries and like people, they evolve in what they can eat now versus a millenium ago.  Natural Choice is one of two that my kitten, now a year-old this month September, will eat. Cats and dogs are domestic animals and need a healthy diet of food specifically for them.  This specific flavor ws not her favorite but in kitten canned food Natural Choice has a few good options my fusspot Eva actually liked and ate. It also is richer, and more filling. This brand in the Kitten chow is much more expensive than what you'll pay in the store for the usual suspects, but it's made with good nutients and has more staying power.  Last month August I adopted two more kittens (they were due to be Euthanized if no one came along) and Natural Choice is the food I feed them. The one who has had canned kitten food loves it. The other, who survived on table scraps, is coming around but it's the only one she'll eat.  The Lamb and Chicken kitten flavor is good as is the Tuna and Chicken.  I can't speak for the adult Cat Food."
5.0,Cheaper @ Costco,"These are a wonderful alternative to expensive K-Cups.  After opening up the sealed bags, I kept mine in a ziplock bag until use.  The 80 count French Roast is significantly cheaper at Costco."
1.0,Original hazelnut butter vs new almond-hazelnut blend,"I have both original and new formula at home. They taste almost the same, but new formula separated after opening and has more oil IMHO. My child loves Nutella, we recently started on a dairy free diet, and this is an ok  substitute for our favorite Ferrero nutella spread. I personally didn't like justin's hazelnut butter taste, especially weird aftertaste, but, since new formula contains almonds, they should put almond picture on the label and the word ""blend"" should be the same size as brand name on the label. They should also lower the price."
5.0,Great Food for Dogs with Sensitive Stomachs,"Finally this dog food is again available.  The bad part is the increased price.  I paid way too much for this food, but my dog needed it.  I was paying $50 for 50#'s and this was $75 for 30#.  I think the price was a matter of supply and demand."
5.0,Now with improved packing by Amazon!,"Like others, we've ordered these excellent cookies before and been disappointed by Amazon's packaging. But the good price kept us coming back, and now it appears that Amazon has listened to everyone's complaints. Our recent order arrived with the 6 rolls of cookies arranged in the shipping box in a clever way that prevented damage, so there's no broken end pieces. Kudos, Amazon!"
5.0,epic,"one of the best energy drinks I ever had. Actually gets me going, motivated to work out. When its all said and done, I'm tired out because of an good work out not the after effects of the drink. Other energy drinks so far gets me going for the first couple hours, and instantly my body crashes. It also tastes great!"
1.0,"Plum Organics ""Just Peaches""","This was my first purchase of Plum baby food. I opened one pouch and the food was discolored and sour! Threw that away and opened the second pouch, same discolored peach!! This food is so expensive and they don't even care about what they pack as baby food? Really bad!  I had purchased ""pumpkin and banana"" also, that seems to be okay once I squeeze a bit out of the pouch initially."
1.0,Putting pure coconut oil in a PLASTIC container???,"This is awesome coconut oil, but it is packaged in a PLASTIC container. Plastic can leech into the product. What is the point of putting a health food in contaminating packaging? Change it! Glass is far more acceptable, and will not will not contaminate the product with the estrogens from plastic. We people who use coconut oil will definitely recycle it, like we do everything else.;)"
5.0,Incredible Scones,I just discovered these at Marshalls and after trying them went back and bought all they had. But they don't always have them so I came to Amazon. WOW! These scones are a delight! Lightly crusty on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Lightly sweet and absolutely scrumptious. Had them fresh out of the oven with some homemade yogurt. I found mine one day rummaging through a shelf at Marshalls. They don't always have them so I came here. Even at a dollar higher it's worth it! I will NEVER buy a hard $2.00 scone at Starbucks again!
5.0,My Maltese Mojo Loves these.,"Since he has a small mouth, I break these down to little pieces and mix them in with his food.  He waits patiently as he sees me do it.  I then give him a kiss on the head, tell him I love you.  Enjoy.  And he does."
5.0,Fiji water***great taste,"Try it at least one time.  It cost a little more, but it's worth it. Delivered to your door by UPS.  Which is great, because the delivery people are great/courteous. Make sure you click on the standard delivery, no delivery charge.  You have to wait for it a little bit longer, but it is worth the wait. No complaints about the delivery, especially if you do not drive. Love the water, love the bottle design.  Try it at least one time."
1.0,Terrible,Terrible item....  packaging hard to remove... gum hard as a rock with flavor that lasts for 10 seconds.....unfortunate waste of money.
1.0,Beware!  Messy!,"I purchased a pack of 6 boxes of 33.8 ounce Vita Coco coconut water.  The package arrived fine.  I put 3 boxes in my refrigerator.  Boy, did they make a mess!  All 3 started leaking overnight.  My wife was not happy at all. I transferred the leaking packs to soda bottles.  I don't want to try putting the remaining 3 packs in the refrigerator and will transfer to soda bottles as well.  I wish I could get a refund, but there is no way to return now, and no easy way to contact the vendor.  This turned out to be a real pain!"
1.0,Taste Awful,"I have tried and enjoyed the Fiber One 90 Calorie Chocolate bars, so I thought I would try these Oats and Chocolate bars since they were on sale.  After making my way through two boxes (I usually eat one a day as a snack).  At this point, I can't eat anymore.  The taste is just bad.  It's not disgusting or anything, but they do not taste good by any means.  I can only handle eating one a week now, or have one daily and always have something else better to eat right afterward.  Oats and Chocolate made me think I was going to get something that tasted like Quaker Granola Bars.  That is not the case, I don't even know that chocolate is an ingredient.  They just taste bad.  Try the Fiber One 90 Calorie Chocolate bars - somehow, the healthier bars taste better."
5.0,PB2 is amazing!,Very impressed with the peanut butter crackers. They taste very good and i highly recommend trying them if looking for a snack item.
1.0,Not Pleased,"I bought this product because the Legacy Farms product (Oat Bran) was shown as not available.  I was looking for the Legacy Farm product.  It seems to be the only one that is gluten free.  The Mulberry Lane Farm product was misleading in that it stated that oat bran is ""naturally"" gluten free.  The truth of this is, if it is ""milled"" in a plant that does not clean or dedicate the equipment to gluten free products, then it is not a gluten free product.  Please bring back Legacy Farm Oat Bran. As a celiac disease person, I must have the totally gluten free product. I had to give away the Mulberry Lane Farm.  I thought they and you (Amazon) were misleading.  Therefore it is the poorest rating you have.  It makes me question buying from you again.  Thanks for asking."
5.0,"If you gotta have a cookie, make it a protein cookie","Love these cookies! If you have a sweetooth and gotta have a cookie, this is the way to go. They don't taste like a protein cookie, they taste like a real cookie, you'd almost think you were cheating :)"
5.0,So tasty!,"I was so glad to find Amazon sold this dinner kit!  They used to sell them at our grocery store, but discontinued after awhile.  While this isn't the most authentic Jambalaya out there, it is darn close.  It also lets you tailor the spice by including a separate red pepper packet.  Zataran's has nothing on Luzianne."
1.0,Not very good,"The peas are not green like the photo on the package, they don't taste like peas, and the coating doesn't taste like wasabi. All in all these are a failure."
1.0,Ripped Off,"Yes, I also got ripped off when I purchased this overpriced product. Let's be clear that Nespresso coffee is good. But I was suckered into purchasing this set of overpriced coffee capsules when it appeared as discount pricing together with a nice capsule stand. It was implied that I would be saving money, but as has already been adequately pointed out, the actual price here is double what the manufacturer charges.  What disturbs me is that I tried to cancel this order before it was shipped. I have never had problems with Amazon before, but every time I tried to cancel (I tried at least 6 times), I got an error message that said to try again. Ultimately, the order was shipped (from Arizona I think) and I got it OK. But I cannot recommend this price or supplier."
5.0,New favorite!,"This one will not disappoint!  I got this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it.  I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups."
5.0,I LOVE LARABARS!!!,"Amazon always has such good prices! I'm so happy I can purchase larabars off Amazon, because I live in Canada and honestly, they sell them for about $1.75/bar it's ridiculous.  The lemon larabars are so far my favorite. They are healthy too, with no preservatives and have such little ingredients and are all natural! They're such a great snack. I would HIGHLY recommend the lemon larabars!"
5.0,"great for older lab, she is like a puppy again","My 11 year old lab ""Stella"", loves to run, play, hunt. She started getting arthritis in her hips and the vet said. glucomsumine and condroitan (sorry about the spelling).  I found food called ""good hips"" on amazon and tried it. Then I found these treats at the local grocery store. Then they quit selling them. I looked everywhere and found them on Amazon.  I subscribe to the dog food from Amazon.  Stella is like a puppy again!  I recommend these items for anyone with a larger or older dog, it really makes a huge difference in the quality of life of our best furry friends. Stella thanks you!"
5.0,Yum,"I have no idea when M&M came out with the mint flavor.  But these are yummy.  I love all things mint.  I also Love Love Love dark chocolate.  Put them together..... Perfection.  These are perfect because they are bite sized.  I don't even mind sharing one or two pieces. LOL.  M&M got this one right.  I also like the peanut butter ones.  But the mint ones are amazing.  The combination is just right.  Sometimes when mint is combined with dark chocolate, one flavor tends to overpower the other.  Not with these.  The dark chocolate is rich and tastes like quality dark chocolate. Not all dark chocolates are created equal.  If you are a fan of the chocolate and mint,  you will love these.  I highly recommend."
1.0,just plain nasty,"If you don't mind substituting flavorless, rubbery ""noodles"" for real noodles then these are for you. The consistency almost induced gagging. I'd rate them zero stars if that was an option.  I'll stick with real pasta, in moderation."
1.0,Awful - zip top is too weak,"I've used brining bags before so when I saw a good price on this 6 pack I thought I was doing myself a favor. I was dead wrong. Thanksgiving eve I went to turn my turkey over and the top opened up completely from the slightest movement. I had turkey brine spilling out into the fridge and all over the floor. Not something I needed to deal with when I was trying to get my pies baked and the table set.  If I weren't a pregnant working mom of a toddler I would return these, but I think I will pass them on to some frenemies instead."
5.0,Discovery of the Century!,"When I found out I was pregnant with my first child, I read in a baby magazine about the wonderful health benefits of Chia seeds. They are packed with Omega-3 fatty acids, and because healthy brain function is nurtured by Omega-3 fatty acids, I wanted to supplement my diet with something other than fish oil pills that can pack a fairly unpleasant aftertaste. These seeds are so tiny, and so flavorless, that you can mix them into cereal, or even juice, without ever realizing you have consumed them. I have also found that adding these seeds to my breakfast keeps me fuller longer. Chia seeds are more convenient than flax seeds, and a pound of them, costing around $12 (depending on the seller), lasts a few months. If you want to avoid the potential unpleasantness of fish oil supplements, Chia seeds are a great alternative, and for new or expecting mothers, they are a great way to ensure your baby is getting what s/he needs for optimum brain health and development. Lastly, you do not have to be considering motherhood to consider adding Chia to your diet. It is a wonderful, all-natural supplement that is perfectly painless (in both taste and cost) to undertake.  Who would have thought that the seeds responsible for the (infamous) ""Chia Pet"" would offer so much more than a gawdy table ornament? Highly recommended."
1.0,Cheap ingredients that actually make your cat gain weight,"I fed my cat Iams Weight Control for 3 years before she died of stomach cancer.  In that time she only lost weight when the cancer started.  Her coat was dull and rough. That experience led me to research feline nutrition both online and by talking to animal nutritionists.  If you read the ingredient list in Iams Weight Control, you'll see that most of the first few ingredients are corn and other grains.  Cats are carnivores and need a high-protein diet, not a high-carb diet.  The extra carbs are stored as fat.  If you have an overweight cat, steer clear of Iams and go with a high-protein, low-carb, grain free premium food. My two young cats eat a variety of high quality food.  I feed them 3-4 times a day and they are at a perfect weight.  Their coats are shiny and soft.  You can feed your cats a lot better food than this."
1.0,seriously.....,Product Features    * English toffee bits   * One 8 oz pacakge   * Approximatley 1 1/3 cups  for 14.99?? 2.49 when they are NOT on sale at the local super market...somebody is a little nuts!
5.0,Lovely...just wish it was a little healthier.,"I really loves the things that I've made with this flour (the pull-apart dinner rolls, chocolate chip cookies and bread).  The dinner rolls had the density of a biscuit but the look of a roll.  They were really fantastic for Thanksgiving, AND they heat up well.  The chocolate chip cookies were tasty as was the bread.  Pro's; Easy to store (no need to have 15 different bags of flours and starches in the cabinet) Tasty results Even gluten eating people thought the rolls were tasty Good price NO ADDED SUGAR!  Con's; First ingredient is white rice flour and the LAST ingredient is Almond flour Has potato starch which tends to hurt my stomach  I probably won't use this very often as I do have other choices but this definitely will be my go to flour mix when I don't want to measure out 9 different kinds of flours OR when I'm making rolls for special occasions (because they seriously were amazing!)  I think if you are cooking for celiac kids (or someone has just gone gluten free) then this mix is a MUST have.  Edited 12.21.10 After almost a month of using this flour I have to admit it's my go to flour.  If a recipe calls for 3 cups of flour I only use 2 1/2 and add 1/2 a cup of teff flour for a little more nutrition.  I love that I don't have a million canisters of every type of flour known to man sitting in my cupboard/fridge and that I've had nothing but sucess with everything I've made using this flour blend.  Another perk it's cheaper than another amazing bread mix I was using and doesn't have sorghum flour or lots of sugar added!  I'm almost embarassed to add that I went through BOTH smaller bags in record time so I just ordered 4 of the 4lb bags!"
1.0,"Bland, I'm not impressed","I bought these since many people commented on how great they taste.  I think they are bland and need to be salted (even though there IS salt on them and I ALMOST NEVER add salt to my food).  I don't think they replace chips and  I don't know that I'll be able to eat the rest.  I certainly didn't think ""these are yummy"" as I tried them.  Also, each bag is 2 servings--I mistakenly thought each bag was 1 serving.  I will by Stacy's soy chips again before these---those are YUMMY--I never should have tried something new."
1.0,DON'T BOTHER,basically glop rolled in sesame seeds - very poor texture - not fun to try to eat
1.0,Filthy,"These were the dirtiest, filthiest, silt-ridden oysters I have ever bought in my life. Even after scrubbing, it was almost impossible to open the oysters without getting silt inside. So many of the oysters were stuck together, and they were so barnacle encrusted it made shucking VERY difficult. I spoke to the owner Ron before ordering, and since he had been so nice on the phone, I called him to tell him of my experience and he offered to make amends when I told him that I wanted to buy some shucked oysters. But instead of $20 with free shipping, Amazon's price is now $25 plus $22 shipping. Wow!  Buy oysters at your local fish market or supermarket where you can pick out your own. I would never buy from this vendor again."
5.0,Great Weight Watcher Plan Cracker,"These crackers taste great and allow the flavor of what ever you put on them to be the star instead of the cracker over powering the toppings flavor.  They are not zero points on the Weight Watchers Points Plus Plan - if you have 18 crackers its 2 points, if you have 9 crackers its 1 point, if you have 5 crackers its 0 points.  5 crackers are plenty with some egg or tuna salad for lunch or as a snack.  I use them with pineapple or mango salsa which are either 0 points or 1-2 points depending on how much salsa you eat."
1.0,Don't buy!,You cannot return it. This is too sweet and you doesn't taste like the actual dried mange. I am very disappointed with this purchase.
1.0,One out of nine packages was NOT defective,"The defective packages have holes or ripped areas in the bottom. This let air in and caused entire contents to solidify. Some of these opened packages had been re-sealed with scotch tape. The outer carton was in good shape, so the defects must have been at the source, rather than at Amazon. I will not permit any of the Cracker Jacks in the carton to be consumed because of the risk of contamination.  Also, it appears Frito Lay, the people who produce Cracker Jacks, is using Amazon as a place to dump the products. The expiration date on the packages was November of 2008. Looks to me like Amazon got dumped on and I was left holding the bag.  Cracker Jacks is apparently not a returnable item."
1.0,NOT thai tea,This was terrible.  I was looking for bags of thai tea to make hot tea with.  This just tasted like regular black tea - not at all similar to the flavor of the stuff they serve in restaurants.
5.0,Popular with students!,"One of my middle school students gave me a bag of these in the cappucino flavor, which I added to my candy jar.  They were gone after a couple classes, and the kids LOVED them (I was a little surprised!)  I still get requests for when I am going to have the ""cappucino candies"" again!"
1.0,banana pancakes?,I was so loking forward too recieving this package! But seriously how anyone can charge $$$$ for a package that only makes 6 pancakes is something too stay away from. The ingredients found are ones that you can duplicate yourself and you can use real ingredients and not artifical flavorings.
1.0,Cats hate it.,"I got a sample package of this stuff from a local pet food store. I was very excited to try it, because it seems like a great idea. Both my cats will eat raw turkey/chicken when it is offered, but completely turned their noses up at this. My dogs were more than happy to not let the stuff go to waste though! I think cats are just more picky. Good idea, but I won't bother buying it."
1.0,Yech,"This is the dryest, most harsh ""granola"" I have ever tasted.  Cluster is in the name, but mine was small, unclustered and very sawdusty looking. I could not dislike a granola more."
1.0,Ripped off for Flowers,"They didn't honor price listed and when I called and sent several emails to complain they stated it was a computer ""glitch"" and proceeded to refund my money. A WEEK before Valentines Day. I was sending over six orders and they ROYALLY screwed me and did not have enough customer service experience to honor the price it sold for. I will NEVER order from this company EVER again!"
1.0,May have made our kitty sick,"We try to feed our cats wholesome healthy foods, so we thought these treats would be a great alternative to the kitty junk food they had been eating.  Our 12yo girl cat sniffed these and turned up her nose. She is superrrrr picky, and lots of times will not consume something the first time you offer it to her, so no biggie.  Our 2yo boy cat, as other reviewers described, went nuts. We gave him a few small bits (maybe the equivalent of 3 regular cat treats in size) and were delighted that we had found a treat he enjoys (he does not like the treats typically found in supermarkets and such).  About 24 hours later around 11pm we noticed he was straining to urinate, unproductive, and jumped in and out of the boxes about 15 times in 30minutes, growling and hissing at the box, and hissing at us when we tried to pet him or pick him up. He urinated on our bed, on his bed, on his pillow, and on the couch. This cat never urinated outside the box before (except during car rides in his carrier) and had never hissed before (even at his evil, manipulative, bullying ""older sister"" cat that loves him dearly).  We called the vet, who squeezes him in first thing in the morning, he had a uti. Several hundred dollars in medicine, overnight hospitalization, and aftercare, he is better.  The only thing we changed in his diet (or, for that matter, in his life) in the two months leading up to his illness were these treats. After the vet told us UTIs were usually related to diet, we threw these out. We will probably never know exactly what caused his illness, but we have a sneaking suspicion..."
5.0,Best Hot Sauce Ever!,This stuff is HOT but has a great flavor.  I am a hot sauce collector and have over 250 different hot sauces.  This is my absolute favorite.
1.0,Repeatedly emailed with NO reply,"I won't get into the back and forth between those who are upset about this not being vegan despite it's being listed as such, and those who think they have no right to complain.  I'm neither vegan nor anti-msg, and was actually looking for a real chicken broth powder.  At [...] , their own website, the picture of the product shows a different ingredient list than the description. Chicken fat, MSG are shown while they explicitly advertise vegan and NO MSG.  I was hoping that they did not intend to mislead, with either the photo or description was for an older version. I emailed them multiple times over the last few weeks (literally resending my questions over and over), without a single reply.  All I wanted was a final answer as to the ingredients! Not much to ask before I consume a food product of theirs.  As I have not received any reply, I can assume they do not care, are intentionally misleading, or do not ever read customer emails. None of these is acceptable. It's a shame because I had planned on buying alot of dried vegetable products, but cannot support such shoddy company behavior."
5.0,greatest coffee,Is so good. Lots of flavor and great coffee taste. Especially good to wake up with. Enjoy this coffee. I give it a plus 10.
5.0,Great!,"Kellogg's Raisin Bran is the best raisin bran.  Product was fresh, tasty and full of raisins.  Shipment arrived quickly and on time and was in great shape.  We will continue to purchase this item."
1.0,"This Product Includes Salt, Black Pepper, and Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)","No wonder they don't include the ingredients in the ad.  MSG has been shown to cause health problems and is entirely unnecessary from a health and taste standpoint.  I never would have bought this product if I had known.  Foolishly I ate some and had heartburn.  I immediately tossed it, feeling really ripped off for my money.  Come now, Amazon -- shouldn't you make it mandatory to include a full rundown on ingredients on products such as this?  Think about it."
5.0,Super!,"These are really exciting.  I got the ginger chews at the local market, and love them, but when I saw the mango-ginger combo, I knew I had to try them.  There's quite a bit of heat in these, and the taste lingers long after the candy is gone.  For the guy who wrote he only eats one or two a day--HOW?  These are delicious.  The 5 lb box will be gone in no time. Thank you Amazon for carrying them.  Thank you Chimes people for a great candy."
1.0,Too thick & Dry,My baby is 8 1/2 months old.  The texture is extremely thick & it's also very dry.  My baby hated it.  We ended up giving it to our dog.  She did well with the Chick Chick meal.
5.0,Absolutely fabulous cereal!,"I was able to buy this product locally at a big box store, but they discontinued it. When I found it on Amazon, I was absolutely thrilled!!! THEN it got even better that I can receive a monthly shipment and even adjust that as needed! This cereal is just so crunchy, tasty, full of dried berries and scrumptious. Now it doesn't matter if I can get it locally. I can get it even easier: my favorite cereal at my front door! Thank you!!!!!!"
1.0,Inconvenient,"I've always used the regular ""litter tray with the scooper"" procedure but when I saw this type, it seemed too good to be true. It was. When you pour the litter on top of the strainer tray, some of the clean litter sifts through and the cats end up with half of the clean litter originally put in. The clumping litter makes solids adhere to the underside of the strainer tray. You have to bang it against something to get the dirty litter off. As you do this, litter sprays around the floor -- no matter how hard you try to be neat, adding an additional ""sweeping step"" to the whole procedure. Also, the litter you have ""strained"" weighs in pretty hefty when you're crouched on the floor lifting and sifting the entire tray of litter daily! So, I say, if you just scoop it daily with a regular scoop, you will get the job done in half the time, with half the mess and half the trouble. I'm going back to the old method."
5.0,Backcountry Cowboy Mud,"We recently moved from Seattle - the coffee capital of the world - to Winthrop.  We did not anticipate being able to buy a locally roasted coffee of the excellent quality of Backcountry Cowboy Mud or any of Backcountry's other roasts.  Mud is a full-bodied, rich and never bitter French roast.  It is the best French roast coffee that I have had."
1.0,Price hike,"I thought the convienience and savings would make it worth it to order this as a subscribe and save , but when I went back to reorder, the price had tripled... Amazon should notify of these changes. They should also only offer items for subcribe and save that they can continue to offer at the same price and those that will also be available long term...."
1.0,bad hot cocoa---easily,"Yes, it is easy, but not good at all. Hot water with little chocolate flavor---Swiss Miss is way better!"
5.0,Delicious hot drink,"I love the taste of this drink! I usually only use half of a packet for a normal sized mug as the flavor is very strong. This is the perfect non-caffeinated drink and it has vitamin C! I didn't care for the product cold, but hot is great! It always dissolves completely with a little stirring unlike other products that leave powder clumps at the bottom of my mug."
5.0,Meow,"This product was recommended to my cat by my vet.  My cat suffers from irritable colon (yes, cats get it too) because of all the stress he went through when my mother-in-law (his former owner)passed away after a battle with cancer.  My cat does not need any medication whatsoever.  This food has been great for him and I don't have to worry about stomach upset anymore.  Great product."
5.0,Son loved it!,I sent this package to my son as a treat. He's away at school and loved getting this care package.
5.0,Never Disappoints,"This is a wonderful food and a staple for my diet bc it doesn't cause any allergic reactions, any heartburn, any gastric probs.  It is easy to prepare and quite bland in itself so that it absorbs flavor from anything you add it to..soup, stew, stir-fry. Also good cold. I have tried a number of different companies selling SaiFun and Dynasty is the best in texture, size, and ease of preparation. A favorite family dish is cooked/well-drained  SaiFun wok-fried with  small broccoli florets and sauteed mushrooms [garlic, garlicpepper,etc.]"
1.0,Wasn't for me,I didn't like the taste of this product - couldn't finish it off because it was a little metallic tasting and had an aftertaste.
1.0,Don't Buy = Get what you pay for,"These are not true cups made for Keurig machines.  There is no filter technology, it simply is instant coffee granules which flow through a hole into the cup.  This company is being sued for patent infringement, but be aware these cups are not gourmet coffees which should be used in the machines.  Inferior product, and the cider cup tore in my machine.  I am requesting refund, and would urge Amazon to not sell this product, or at least change the description.  This was the most disappointing product I have ever received from Amazon."
1.0,Yuck!,"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as ""all-natural"" but had ingredients like ""natural flavors and colors"". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink."
5.0,Disregard The Negative Reviews,"I don't understand all the negative reviews...this coffee is great! I had purchased a box of it and hadn't tried it yet; however, after reading the reviews here, I was ready to take it back to the store and exchange it for another flavor. But I thought I should at least give it a try...I'm glad I did! It is a milder coffee but it has a wonderful aroma and flavor! I was pleasantly surprised as I was expecting something disgusting (as per some of the reviews here). I certainly didn't smell SKUNK! It smelled very good as it was brewing...a little carmel-like. I added a little carmel whipped topping and it tastes scrumptious.  I hope you will give it a fair trial and don't be biased by the negative reviews. People have different tastes; coffee is such an individual preference. That's why there are ten zillion variety of coffees. But I hope you'll give this one a chance...I bet you'll be glad you did! ;-)"
5.0,"Fast, Easy, and Taste Great !","I have been taking these for a month or so and find them not only to be a very effective way to lower my cholesterol, but they taste great (like candy) as well.  No easier or effective way to lower you cholesterol without a script.  They can also be used in conjunction with a script to maximize your ability to lower cholesterol.  Great product!"
5.0,good buy especially you need to add up items for super savings,My dog loves them.  Even in slivers they are big enough for my over 100lbs dog.  We used to buy whole pig ears and it's pretty messy because my dog crushed the whole ear and tiny shreds were every where.
1.0,This stuff is Nasty!,"Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews.  I've been looking for an instant coffee that is a reasonable fascimile of real drip or brewed coffee and based on the reviews here , I purchased this stuff.  As background, I Like the taste of real coffee, so I drink my coffee black, with no sugar!  I think it would be impossible to drink this stuff that way.  It tastes like sewage..  ughh...  I can choke down Nescafe instant coffee if I have to.. but this stuff is awful!!  I have no idea how anybody could even remotely compare this to real coffee..  Maybe if you used 10 teaspoons and sugar and 2:1 ratio of milk or cream, it might be palatable.. but as a for real coffee flavor.. yuck!!"
1.0,Not good.,"These are very artificial tasting, and just not tasty. And I have a very very high tolerance for artificially sweetened products. Overpriced...Chrystal Light lemonade would make a better lemon drop."
5.0,Baconnaise Lite - for those that shouldn't,"When I saw the add, I knew I wanted to try it.  I already have a mixed selection of the Bacon Salt.  Good flavor, what I expected...but don't overdue it and it is better. Great on fries and mix it with a little lite mayo or sour cream for a salad dressing or dip.  I will accept that it isn't as creamy as mayo, and it has a kinda lite,gritty texture almost,if you taste it by itself.  Try it with peanut butter on toast.  My problem is my brother, he uses mayo on everything and he loves it, so I hide a jar just for myself.  It does have a pretty strong smokey bacon flavor by itself."
5.0,My favorite Haribo gummy.,This gummy is really sweet but the peach flavor balances it out. It is not a stiff gummy like other Haribo gummies so I give it my daughter every now and then.
1.0,Slow sprouting,I too have a problem with these seeds taking too long to sprout.  I would like a return of my money.
5.0,The Go To Meal!,"I don't review often but when I am satisfied with a product like this, well I just had to say how much I appreciate and love this product.  I have very picky eaters.  They don't eat ANYTHING new.  But, this product did the trick.  I've been feeding this to my now 13 month old since he was 5 months old.  He can't get through the day with at least one of these pouches.  I send (among other things) this pouch to daycare everyday.  At home he has it with some oatmeal and organic butter.  My toddler daughter also loves this.  She will take a pouch to pre-school and actually finish it every time she finds it in her lunchbox.  I even gave one to a co-worker who recently got braces as an adult and even she liked it, though she preferred the pear and mango one more.  I can't recommend this enough.  I bought a single serving pouch at Target first to try it and once my kids were hooked I've been doing subscribe and save.  I also do subscribe and save with the pear and mango one...it's delicious!"
1.0,Not so gold,"The organic ""golden"" yunnan apears to be just a black yunnan. Do not waste your money!!"
5.0,Pamela's wheat and gluten free bread mix,"We've been using this product for my son with many allergies for almost 1.5 years.  As the manufacture says, it's wheat and gluten free.  My wife makes cakes, waffles, and breads.  And my son always loves it.  Now Amazon has a periodically delivered program with a good discount.  We'll keep purchasing it from Amazon and using it for my son."
5.0,"Perfect Product, you won't be disappointed.","Perfect condition. Rapid delivery. Front door service. No dings or dents. No delivery charges. Pop tops (no can opener needed). What more could you ask for?  5 STARS in my opinion!  I mix this into my 3 DOGS dry food with hot water. It adds a nice gravy, softens the food, & adds the fish oil which makes their fur soft & shiney. I'm NOT a vet, so only do this on your own accord. But they seem to LOVE it, then so do I."
5.0,These really worked for me!,"I purchased these with a bit of apprehension, but they work amazingly well! I dissolved one on my tongue and tried a lemon, and it was sooooo sweet! I ate it like a sweet orange, and I wanted more but I didn't want to get sick from the acid. I also tried smoked turkey, which was amazing and tasted like honey, cheese (not much difference but still tasted marginally better), hot sauce (sweet), and sweet drink, which was crazy sweet! These things work perfectly! They really are a miracle berry!"
5.0,Kitties Love It!,That's enough said.  The babies went crazy.  The product came when expected and in the expected condition.  I would certainly buy it again.
5.0,STRAWBERRY nestle carnation instant breakfast is hard to find,my son loves only STRAWBERRY instant breakfast and has a difficult time finding that flavor. I goggled and found several sites but this was the most economical price and delivery was speedy! Will order again.
1.0,Coffee,"Yuck! Awful and since I expected beans instead of ground coffee, I'm even less impressed. I have a very good quality coffee maker, but this stuff stinks."
5.0,Very Satisfied,"I am very satisfied with this product. I use it all the time when I need that pick me up in the morning. I am not a coffee drinker. I have also stopped drinking energy drinks and soda. These energy drinks give me that extra burst of energy and last longer without the crashing feeling. Also it don't seem to keep me from eating, as some energy drinks would stop the craving leaving me with the shakes and jittery from not eating. The shipping was fast and the price was great.  I am very satisfied with this product!  Thank you."
1.0,Incorrect description,"I am certain that this company is well-meaning.  Unfortunately, I am out $50.  The capsules are clearly not compatible and should not be marketed as compatible with Nespresso.  I liked the idea that I read, but they absolutely do not work.  You may not get a refund, either.  Do not buy this product."
5.0,my new main tea,"This is a great choice for an everyday black tea, similar to an ""English Breakfast"" tea.  I have been using PG Tips Special Blend, but it has become unavailable, so I tried this and it is a similar quality."
1.0,don't care for it,I really like crystal light lemonade flavor.  I did not care for these flavors at all.  To sweet and an after taste.  I was excited to try them.  Wish I hadn't.
1.0,i am writing this review still chewing this (for the past 5 mins),"It's simply disgusting. The flavor may not be terrible (a little bitter), but the texture is the worst of any food I've ever bought myself. It's gooey and sticky NOT in the way you want it to be, and sticks to every inch of the inside of your mouth and I'll probably be trying to get all the nasty goo off my gums and teeth for the next 10 minutes or so. It is simply disgusting. Trust me. I'm chewing as I type, and I am going to walk away from my desk to gargle my mouth with water."
1.0,BAD FOR PIZZA,"I used this mix for pizza dough and was terribly disappointed. The dough was much too soft, wrong consistency for crust, and the taste was just ""off"" for pizza crust. I do not know about this mix for other baked goods as I only tried it for pizza."
1.0,Recieved OLD and HARD candy!!!  Very Disappointed!!!,"I ordered 3 bags of this candy because my girls love it so much.  I wanted to give to them for Christmas but when I received the packages I was very disappointed!  The candy is very, very hard which you can tell was probably exposed to heat.  The expiration date is March 2012; however, the candy is not fresh and damaged.  They should not have sold this candy and/or they should have mentioned that it is ""OLD"".  I am UNABLE TO RECEIVE FULL REFUND!  Had I known the candy is hard and not fresh, I would have not ordered it at all!!"
1.0,Not molasses,"Note the Disclaimer: product may be different than pictured.  Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store doesn't know Barbados Molasses from old motor oil - and the label on the jar doesn't state what is in it. This goop is no different from Brer Rabbit sorghum (syrup) that you can buy in your local grocery store, other than it costs 3X as much through Amazon.  When I contacted Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store I was told they were just the distributor, so tough luck if I ended up with the wrong product.  Amazon is silent.  Lesson: DON'T TRY TO BUY ""MOLASSES"" FROM A BOOK STORE.  And DON'T BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM PA. DUTCH GEN'L STORE.  ""GOLDEN BARREL"" ISN'T THE ""BARREL MOLASSES"" YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  It's just a name on a label.  A PENNZOIL label would have been just as accurate.  The Disclaimer conveniently allows the vendor to display any picture, but ship anything from axle grease to dishwater.  Amazon needs to go back to selling books and stop trying to be Walmart."
1.0,very disappointing,"This is actually the second year in a row I bought this, so this bad product experience has been confirmed.  The roof just does not stick on.  It mentions to hold it in place for 1 minute while the icing sets, but that just doesn't do it, before we knew it, the roof was slowly sliding down.  Tried propping it up with sticks, but messy and difficult.  Thought we had it, came back 15 minutes and the whole rotten structure had fallen down like a cheap house of cards.  I haven't tried eating this current one, but the last one was not very tasty either.  It was a frustrating time for us, and a sad time for the kids to see it fall apart.  Do not buy!"
5.0,Buy This Item," Butler NutriSentials Lean Treats for Dogs (twenty 4-oz resealable bags)  This is a great product sold at Veterinarian Offices, for a more reasonable price"
1.0,Cheap,"You can get this same product at many local grocery stores. Look around, maybe find a local store.  This costs 3X the amount I would pay at any store."
5.0,Love this healthy product,"Just saw this in a book of recipes I'm been using and thought I would try it. I was really amazed by how good it is. I had never tried it before. Did some reading about how to prepare it, but this is better than most cause you don't have to wash or soak it. Its clean and has a very good taste. I will be buying more."
1.0,Coffee Nightmare! Stay away from this seller....,"Received the wrong item and called to complain.  The person who answered the phone was completely unprofessional and sounded incoherent.  At first he told me he could help me then told me to call back when a SUPERVISOR was available. Next call, my credit card company.  I almost neglected to mention that the incorrect order I received contained a packing slip with someone else's address and credit card info.  Scary stuff here."
1.0,Too expensive and dry!,"There are only 12 pieces in a bag, and they are dry, not worth it. I will stick to ones that I find in local middle eastern or Indian grocery stores."
5.0,Yum!  Dogs love 'em!,This is a great product.  Just a tiny treat tid bit that dogs seem to love but keeps them from packing on lots of calories.  My dogs are real foodies so I'm always hunting for new and different snack / training bites for them.  This one fits the bill perfectly.  Highly reccommend...
5.0,Excellent Graham Crackers!,"These Graham Crackers are definitely a cut above the regular graham crackers. They have a great flavor, are crunchy and hold up well to dunking. They taste much better than Nabisco and most store brands. We have a box of the Nabisco Honey Graham Crackers and I definitely prefer the Back to Nature Graham Crackers. The Nabisco (and most others) have a somewhat bland flavor where the Back to Nature have a very good flavor that is noticeable. I have a sweet tooth and these would definitely satisfy it and would also be much healthier but I would still prefer these even if they weren't healthier."
5.0,Nirvana by the Cup,"While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.  If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.  While the tea bags are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.  Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!  Each packet is 100 calories.  Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.  If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.  ~The Rebecca Review"
5.0,Good Nutritional Yeast`,I have tried Brewers Yeast many times through my life and no matter how good it is suppose to be for you if you didn't hold your nose and drink it in one gulp it would gag you. But this nutritional yeast in a green smoothie is not only good your you but taste good too.
5.0,The best Italian peppers you can get this side of Calabria,"These are the real deal. Italian hot chili peppers marinated in olive oil. They are salty, delicious heat. I like slapping them on slices of fresh bred or crackers and stuffing myself. They make a great antipasti addition or pizza topping. I probably woudn't include them in pasta sauce or with pasta because they are pretty salty, and there are better options for that (Like Delallo's imported pepper and garlic pasta sauce, which is similar but with garlic and not very salty). If you  are a hot pepper aficionado you will love these, not becaues they are burning hot (they aren't) but because they have enough heat to be respectable, but also flavor that you can't find among typical hot peppers."
1.0,Disappointing taste,"I've tried 6 other Annie Chun's noodle flavors. Some I really liked and others just needed some meat added to taste yummy. But for this one, adding meat nor minimizing the amount of sauce didn't do anything to alter the awful sour taste. Please improve on the sauce."
5.0,Great for my older Border Collie,"Both of my dogs love these treats! My border collie has been having problems with stiffness in her back legs so I thought I would give these a try. I have been giving them to her everyday for about a month and just last weekend she racied me down the stairs outside!!!  And she won!!! I really think these are helping her, so I'm on ""Subscribe and Save"" and will keep giving them to her forever if it keeps her out of pain. I also give one to my yorkie. No hip/lep problems there but maybe we can head em off at the pass!! They LOVE how they taste and both sit patiently waiting for their treat!!! Thank you Zuke's!!!!"
1.0,YUCK,"Not buying these again, EVER!!  Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!  It might as well have been roasted straw."
1.0,Poor,"The runts that I received did NOT match the picture.  The picture is the classic style, but I was sent the new style.  Either change the picture or send what is depicted.  This was almost a case of false advertising."
1.0,The smell really does linger for weeks!,"I'm going to be blunt, but this stuff freaks me out. I read the other review about the smell and didn't think much of it. Well, that review hit home after I made my first package of oatmeal. My entire place, including the microwave, has wreaked of fake flavoring for over a week. I'm not the type that sniffs food, this stuff just overpowers your surroundings. I'm done with this processed mess and going to throw the eight boxes away."
5.0,GREAT COOKING OIL,"I am not convinced that Safflower Oil will help you loose weight.  Sorry Dr. OZ.  HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is the very best Cooking Oil that I have ever used. Even when frying hashbrowns, the oil stayed clean enough to reuse twice.  I forgot that I had the burner on high one day, and it took a very long time before I noticed the oil slightly smoking.  It adds NO unpleasant taste to foods you fry like some oils, and in fact I really like to thin my Ranch Salad Dressing down with a couple tablespoons of Safflower oil.  Yes it changes the taste slightly, BUT I LIKE THE NEW TASTE BETTER.  I can HIGHLY recommend this as your primary cooking oil, and I like it FAR BETTER than even Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  The Price is reasonable too."
1.0,PRICING COMPLAINT ONLY,I love this bread and have been using it for years.  I used to order it here utilizing the subscribe and save feature.  Those days are now over at this price of $43.25 for 6.  I also use Bob's Red Mill bread mix so My bread options are not limited.  Gluten Free Pantry sells this for $23.94 plus $13.98 shipping.  HUH???  Outrageous!  Amazon pricing even with the subscribe and save feature still equates to about $5.00 more in total than GFP.  Amazon just lost my business with this product.  Walmart pricing is currently $4.29 per box in my area.  I will stock up today before their pricing goes up.  Please note that my prices mentioned here may be plus or minus a few cents.  I am going from memory in the last few minutes.  :)
1.0,Tastes horrible!,I ordered these thinking I would like them because they were given the thumbs up on the Dr. Oz show. Wrong. They are terrible and you can't return them. Make sure you taste them yourself before you order...
5.0,"Perfect cakes, fast shipping - VERY happy","Bought these for a blackout cake lover (and critic) who was VERY HAPPY. They're beautiful, delicious, moist cakes of goodness. They arrived on dry ice within 2 business days... will definitely order again!"
5.0,very good,"of couse it need sugar or natural sugar, I mix enough for a week in advance, it melt better for a hot chocolat drink, I use agave, it is liquid , just a bit of water and agave, it is ok at room temperature and stay soft."
1.0,do not purchase.,"If you like REAL chew like I do, I love to pack it in my lip and use it like you would dip. Then this is not for you, this has such big hard chunks in it that's it completely not enjoyable to have in your lip and you might as well just chew it like regular beef jerkey.  I am completely dissatisfied with this product and am going to just toss it in the trash can."
5.0,bacon salt is addictive,"My family would literally love to have everything flavored with bacon.  There can never be too much.  Therefore, everything from baconnaise to  J&D's bacon lip balm (I kid you not), has been a hit.  Since we can never have enough, when we start to run low I tend to pick up the bacon salt sampler's when they are on sale (they make great -odd gifts as well)"
5.0,Best honey out there!,"This honey is the best there is! We're in the Army so we travel alot, but being originally from Colorado I have always loved this honey, I just cant find it anywhere. So I was thrilled that Amazon sold it in bulk. Now I stock up on this honey because the flavor is so good, I have never tasted better honey. Also Amazon does a great job at shipping the honey, never recieved a broken bottle of honey and the honey has always been a perfect consistency, never hard or crystalized."
1.0,meat was sour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hi Tommy Here Purchased 2.5 sopressata as price and shipping were great.I was going to slice a half pound at a time and give to my kids when they came over.I tasted one slice and found it to be medicinal and very sour.Its texture and smell were perfect,but was inedible.I asked my 27 year old daughter to taste(in case it was me)and she spit it out.She loves sopressata.So sorry Columbus Maybe Californians have no taste buds.Was refunded by Taylor's."
1.0,not very good,"I've tried this a couple of time and both times the noodle just fell apart.  The taste was rather sweet, not like regular pasta.  Now searching for some better pasta substitute."
1.0,Was there a recipe change?,"I have been drinking Pero ever since I was a little girl. My grandmother in Germany would send it to us every Christmas. The order before last, the Pero still had the same great taste as I remembered having as a little girl. Then the order that I recently placed, tasted funny, like maybe the recipe was changed. It was also a bit of a lighter shade than my previous case. I would love to order another, but I want only one canister to make sure that I must have gotten a bad batch and not a change in recipe."
1.0,very disappointed,"I ordered this tree for a Valentines gift for my boyfriend.  It looks dead!  We will try to revive however...it doesn't look good.  It looks to me like it may have froze but I'm not an expert.  The packaging is as everyone says a pain which would have been fine had it looked healthy.  Unfortunately there was no zero for a rating.  I got a beautiful diamond necklace, he got a very sick looking tree."
5.0,delicious!,"I use this product to make protein shakes and I love that it blends easily because of the powder form, it's lower in calories and fat than regular pb, and it tastes just like the real thing!"
5.0,Try it with yogurt for more flavor,"I suggest trying it with yogurt, and skipping the milk and butter all together if you prefer a stronger flavor. I like strong cheeses and sharp cheddar, I also appreciate a thick and creamy Mac & Cheese. 1/4 a cup of plain yogurt (or to taste!) is worth a try."
5.0,MB,"I was looking for sardines that are low in sodium.  This is true of Season Skinless & Boneless. My husband does not like skin and bones in his sardines, so this product appears to be good for both of us. The taste is fine even with a little olive oil added. The only negative is the price... a bit high, but for my health I'll continue to choose this one and see how it works."
5.0,Mellow Chocolate Flavor,"""Millstone's Chocolate Velvet"" is a mellow coffee with a delicious mild chocolate flavor. The Arabica coffee beans are hand picked and dried in the sun. They are then shipped to America where a master roaster roasts them to perfection. This coffee is just flavored enough to enhance the coffee flavor and doesn't overpower the natural flavor. I always buy this for special occasions and then end up drinking it all up! I don't drink a lot of coffee as I'm more of a tea person but this is one of my favorites.  ~The Rebecca Review"
1.0,Great Product horrible packing/shipping Amazon!,I love this product and signed up for the monthly delivery..but unfortunately the order arrived 75% damaged and moldy. I am currently attempting to get a refund.
1.0,Crushed coookies,I like the product but the sender didn't pack them well and they all were crushed.  I was told they would give me a credit but have not seen it.
1.0,not good,"this is the worse coffee i have ever drank, i would not buy this coffee ever again, in fact i could not even give it away, so i had to throw it in the trash,everyone in my family uses k-cups but they did not like this coffee,"
1.0,Has an artificial vanilla flavor,Sorry but I was looking for a nice madagascar vanilla smooth tea and this one had a very artificial flavor and the smell of it is very unpleasant.
5.0,Organic sprout seed mix,"I must say I was very pleased with my results using this  organic sprout mix. I 'm new to sprouting & purchased a Kindle book that gave me a lot of resource's to help me get started called ""How to sprout raw food by Ruppenthal,R.J. I harvested my sprout's 4 day's later. I also ordered more organic sprout mix from the same company. I love having fresh sprout's to use for salad, on sandwich's & so much more. The is the best way to get live sprout's to enjoy all year long at a modest cost. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Same great taste but in a smaller package,I like that these come in individual packages. It's great for kid's snack in their lunch box. It's just the right size. The larger bumblebar packets are too big for kids. Amazon is the only place that I could find these in chocolate flavor.
5.0,The only sugar substitute we use,"After realizing how high the calorie content was in our flavored coffee creamer, my husband convinced me to try Truvia with half and half instead.  I was a bit skeptical because I strongly dislike other artificial sweeteners and didn't think this would be much different.  To my surprise, to me it really doesn't taste that much different than sugar.  We use it in our coffee every day.  It is more expensive than other sweeteners, but buying in bulk helps with that part.  For us, it's worth it knowing we're using a sweetener that's low calorie and, most importantly, natural and not chemically-based."
1.0,Ain't worth it.,"I rarely write reviews, but concerning this product I had to. I unfortunately suddenly developed a caffeine allergy and have had to use substitutes. Used Postum as a child, but it is no longer available. Cafix and Roma Kaffree are quite reasonable. I use a bit of each together, and that's fine. Celestial makes many good products, but this is not one of them. Tried Roastaroma tea in small and larger amounts, and the stuff is absolutely vile. Very medicinal in taste. Nothing tastes like tea or coffee, but this is a poor substitute. I really do not know how it received 16 5 star reviews. Good luck if you want to try it, but first get some locally before you buy the 6 packs offer thru Amazon. Amazon/vendor are fine, and Amazon kindly refunded my money."
1.0,"Chocoalate good, if not melted!",Don't buy this in hot weather or it will arrive a liquified gooey mess. No packaging provisions were made for the fact that this is a meltable product.Ridiculous to sell this online is such provision is not made.
1.0,Would not order again,Was excited to try the Chocolate Banana as I love NuGo bars when the box arrived the chocolate on the bar was discolored and stale tasting. The exp date is 09/01/2011. I would not order these again.
5.0,Great Product; Great Service,"I served Starbucks Verona coffee to houseguests in June. They commented that the coffee was unusually good and asked what it was. This family grinds coffee beans daily for the freshest brew possible, and they are very discerning. I then sent 3 backs of Verona to the family as a gift. The product arrived a day early and I am assured it is just as fresh and good as if they had purchased it at a Starbucks store."
5.0,Super buy!,"I've looked for these everywhere recently (WalMart, Target, Publix) and could not find them in stores.  I decided to go ahead and order them even though people were giving mixed reviews on the flavors they were getting.  In our package I received 1 Orange, 3 Blueberry, 5 Strawberry, & 3 Apple . . . yes Apple! I was surprised to see it since most said they didn't get apple but we did.  It's unfortunate that they can't stock the packages evenly with 3 of each flavor but it was well worth the price.  No screw off lid like others had said but that wasn't a huge selling point for me either.  Prices were much better than on the actual Florida's Natural website where they were $0.99 for each 1.5oz carton and they only offered orange, blueberry, & strawberry.  Plus I got free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime so my daughter & I are already enjoying them!"
5.0,YUM,Great taste & texture!!! They were gobbled up by my hubby & kids who are not on a GF diet. Thanks Betty!
5.0,Cats love salmon flavor,"I have two cats, one who needs hairball help, the other who just gets it because he is the Alpha Cat and it is all about him. My fussy eater cat has hairball trouble & is so fussy about scents, flavors. She loves the Hartz product, esp salmon flavored. It is easy to administer. Her sidekick gets some too just to be fair. They will also use malt flavored but the salmon is the favorite and we like being able to order rather than go out to buy it."
5.0,Best Peanut Butter Cookies,"These are the best peanut butter cookies I have ever purchased.  If you like NutterButter, these taste a lot like them, only better!  I was thrilled to find a cookie that is on the healthier side and tastes so good."
5.0,"The REAL Coconut Juice, the Healthier Alternative to Coconut Juice BLENDS with Sugar added.","If you have never drank coconut juice fresh from the coconut, you are missing one of Natures most refreshing drinks.  If your only experience is drinks served at Asian restaurants, you need to know - this is NOT the same thing.  Most places sell the cheaper - with sugar and water added - version of this drink.  I am so happy that AMY & BRIAN have stuck with the more expensive PURE coconut juice.  It is definitely less sweet.  It will quench your thirst better.  You won't have to worry about the extra calories.  It's the real thing.  You will not want to share the can, so be sure to count all of the 2 servings of calories.  I used to buy this by the case on Amazon, but sadly the price went way up (from $18) and I got cases with dented and leaking cans.  So $$ was not worth it.  I can not find it locally, and so am suffering with the sugary stuff again.  I wish the price would come down and shipping did not kill the cans."
5.0,Chocolate Chunk Mania,"This is the best Chocolate Chunk cookie ever.  Tons of delicious chocolate and bite size crispy cookies.  I ate the whole bag when I opened it, yummy!"
1.0,Apples from China,I was very excitd to get these healthy organic fruit crisps. They are delicious but after further investigation...yes...the apples are from China and Chile! We have a hard enough time in the US keeping up with organic standards much less trying to track other countries. Only by US organic !
5.0,LOVE these little gems Free Ship with Amazon Prime!!!,"These are GREAT when you want some crunch without all the bad stuff.  I love each ingredient by itself -it's heaven mixed together!  Healthy alternative to boxed cookies with empty calories.  Yes, I can eat a bag in one sitting.  These require self control because of the price!"
1.0,Downright awful!,"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
5.0,ThinkThin Protein bar-chunky peanut butter,"I love them and usually eat one each day.  It has alot of alcohol sugar that can be hard on the digestion system, so if you sensitive to things like that, beware."
1.0,Not My Favorite,"I bought a kilo of this tea and shared it with a friend.  Both of us had the same opinion.  The tea has body, but very little flavor.  To get flavor, I had to mix it with some Ceylon or Darjeeling.  In my opinion, Taylors of Harrogate Yorkshire Red or Yorkshire Gold are far superior to Ntingwe Kwazulu as breakfast teas.  I won't buy this tea again."
5.0,My Dog loves These!,"We were buying thses from our vet, but they are so expensive. So glad we found them online.  Our dog loves these! Thanks!"
1.0,PRICE?,"The list price can not be right. I have looked online at other sites and have never seen it priced that much. Found it actually for the price it is selling for. WEIRD Might be a good product, but sneaky selling tacticts."
1.0,"Yeah, that was unfortunate.","Don't think the previous reviewer is wrong, jaded, or somehow a veggie jerky competitor.  These things really are rubbish.  What's worse?  This good deal through Amazon means you'll have plenty of these meat flavored sponges to impress your friends with how bad it can get.  I will say that my friends and I found that if you leave them out to dry for about 48 hours, they do get a little better in the texture department.  But to quote one friend, ""well, that made them easier to spit out."""
5.0,gluten free and delicious!,"So happy I found this product, as is my whole family. These noodles cook quickly (one minute) and are versatile enough to serve in many different ways. I have added them to soup, served with tamari, tofu, and vegetables, and next intend to put in spring rools (rice wrappers). They hold together well but can get very sticky if you overcook them. For best results add a bit of oil (or rinse well) after cooking so they are less apt to stick together. Good nutritional value overall, and very tasty."
5.0,The best hard candy I've found.,"I bought these on an impulse, then ignored them in my kitchen cupboard for over a month.  When I got around to eating one, I found it difficult to stop.  They are really that good.  Just a little bit tart and not too sweet... with a rich pomegranate flavor.  I carry them in my purse and car, and when I get an urge for something sweet, I pop one in my mouth.  Okay, they're not as satisfying as a Dove bar, but an entire package contains fewer calories."
5.0,One word for this coffee...,And...that word is YUM.  I thought  probably anything Emeril put his name on had to be really good and I was right.
5.0,Like a regular cookie,"My 5 yo loves these cookies.  There are very few gluten free, egg free cookies out there that taste good, and these are one of them.  My father visited and ate some before I could tell him they were my son's ""special"" cookies, and he couldn't even tell they were gluten free.  I sent a package to my son's school so that for special events they have them on hand, and my son isn't excluded....in fact just yesterday they had a Teddy Bear Tea, and even he was able to have a plate of cookies like everyone else in the class. I am so glad we found these..."
1.0,20% pistacchio only,This product is mostly sugar (it contains only 20% pistacchio butter!!!!). If that would have been listed on the description I wouldn't have bought it in the first place.
1.0,Not Recommended--stale.,"I thought I'd try this product, as my Mom loves crackers and things like the Wasa crispbreads.  These were disappointing to both my Mom and myself.  They tasted stale, even though the expiration date was almost a year away.  The flavor was somewhat improved by toasting them.  They are edible enough, and I won't return them to amazon because I wouldn't want to cause them unnecessary expense, but I won't order them again.  Note, the packaging is different from the photograph.  Since I'm stuck with 11 boxes, I plan to take them to class, where hungry classmates will gradually eat them up.  Just fyi, they are not vegan, for people that need that.  I've copied the ingredients list as printed on the box.  ""Ingredients: Spelt wheat flour, water, malt, expeller pressed soy bean oil, salt, egg whites, yeast. Toppings: sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, caraway seeds, dehydrated onion flakes.""  ""Manufactured for: Good Groceries Company, Brooklyn NY, 11231""  They were mailed to amazon in Hazleton, PA from ""Adam Gershuny, Good Groceries Company, 44 Heller Park Lane, Somerset NJ, 08873-1206""  I appreciate amazon giving us the opportunity to try different products, but will try to do better next time in choosing which snacks to order."
1.0,Did I do wrong?," Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6) These noodles were like rubber bands, could not pulverize them with teeth.  Inedible.  What did I do wrong? Please tell me."
1.0,"NOT ""Lighty Sweetened""","To be fair I prefer my coffee without sugar, but was not terribly concerned with a ""lightly sweetened"" product.  However, as previous reviews mention, this is 3/4 sugar and is sickly sweet.  There needs to be a version w/o any sugar (or artificial sweetener) since it does seem to ""mix"" better with cold water than the other variations of VIA.  (or Starbucks could package an iced version with separate packets of sweetener)  For the time being if you prefer non sweetened iced coffee or prefer to sweeten it to you liking steer away from this."
1.0,be very sure,"Please be aware that Cash & Carry has a huge selection of flavored syrups, for about $4.50/bottle. If you are purchasing from Specialty Restaurant Equipment, be very certain of your order. I bought 2 bottles and after about $11/bottle, plus $13.50 in shipping, I requested to return it, due to a duplicate order. Their response was that after the re-stocking fee and shipping reimbursement, I would have only received a $3 refund. So yes, we will be keeping the syrup and I'm sure it will stay in our pantry for at least 5 years. Our stupid mistake, but I think the vendor needs to reconsider about restocking fees unless they sell to actual businesses."
1.0,Kibble Drop: too easy,"This product is not what we'd hoped for at all.  It was WAY too easy for our dogs to figure out.  If you have a dog with any sort of intellect, choose something else!"
5.0,Awesome!,"I have a one and two year old who just love these pouches. I appreciate the convenience and the fact that it is a nice healthy snack for them, especially when we are on the go. I like ordering the case on Amazon as it is a much better deal and I always have a nice stash."
1.0,Don't Buy!,"I purchased this as a moisturizer for my hair.  Very faint rose smell, almost non-exsistent.  On the bottle the ingredients listed are 50% distilled water and 50% rose petals; that must be a mistake because all I smell is water."
1.0,Yuck,Tried to make chocolate chip cookies with this.  My son said they tasted like a camel's behind.  Don't really want to try baking with it again.  Went on their website and used their recipe.
5.0,The Best I ever tasted,ummmm ummm ummm very tasty and i prefer them over regular chips. My 3yr old loves them especially the green beans.. yummy
1.0,Doesn't taste like English Breakfast to me.,"I usually drink Twinnings or Bigelow English Breakfast tea in bags, but I'm trying to switch to loose teas and this was my first attempt at English Breakfast.  The dry tea smells like English Breakfast to me, but once it is brewed it smells and tastes totally different, and I don't like the taste at all.  I followed the directions and I have tried different brewing times (2-5min), adding different amounts of milk and/or sugar.  Other people might like it, but be aware that it may not taste anything like what you expect."
5.0,Love this stuff!,"This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or ""something vaguely familiar"" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have ""detox sickness"". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order. Love, love, love!"
1.0,MUCH Cheaper at Whole Foods!,"I was considering a purchase to try this out after reading so many positive reviews and reading that it is also dairy and soy free, HOWEVER, I called my local Whole Foods to see if they carried this and was told they did and it was $5.69 per loaf.  This - - with S&H - - comes to $7.70 per loaf.  NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!  WF also told me they carry Udi's Hamburger buns in a 4-pak for $4.69 per pk, again MUCH cheaper than AMZ's offerings. NOT A GOOD DEAL AMZ!  Why is it that any time there is a special need, it is used to justify outrageous prices, even on items thar are cheaper to make/produce than the regular ones - - like Tuna with just tuna, water or oil and salt @ $2.++ or more per can, as opposed to the nonsense with vegetable broth, etc. for a dollar or less per can?  If we refuse to buy their products at these outrageous prices and let these venture niche products sit on the shelf, they might reconsider their outrageous prices.   Udi's Gluten Free White Sandwich Bread (1 Case)   (Are you listening AMZ????)"
1.0,Very poor quality Dates,"I received the dates wrapped in brown butcher paper in a box.  They were not sealed in a bag, which could have led to some of the problems with these dates.  They were very hard and had a pungent chemical taste (a little like toilet bowl cleaner smells) that made them inedible.  Also, there were small bits of white paper stuck to many individual dates.  I returned the product to receive a refund, but did have to pay $12 return shipping."
1.0,It is basically thick chocolate frosting,"What I am saying is that if I gave you a spoon of this stuff and said ""Friend, taste my homemade chocolate frosting,"" you would say ""Oh my, that is a tasty chocolate frosting, but it's a bit thick.""  They say ""no sugar added!"" with pride, but note ""evaporated cane juice"" is the second most prominent ingredient.  It's just thick frosting."
1.0,Horrible aftertaste,"They taste good at first, but they have the absolute WORST aftertaste ever. I ate the strongest-tasting things I could find, brushed my teeth at least 3 times, and when I woke up the next morning, it was still there. DO NOT BUY THESE."
1.0,Beware Formula Change!,"This tea has been our favorite green tea for years.  According to the manufacturer, Hain Celestial, the ingredients have recently changed.  They removed the hibiscus.  Be warned, the tea is now yellow-green and tastes awful.  The box and ingredients list have not changed.  We are stuck with 2 cases that we can't return to Amazon."
1.0,Cheaper at Walmart,"My kids love these so I thought I would look on Amazon to see if they had them. I was happy to see they did in a multi-pack but was appalled to see how much they were. They are only $.28 at Walmart so for a pack of 12, only $3.36. Even with the subscribe and save, it's more than double the price on here. Very disappointing!"
5.0,Ever since I was a little girl....,I started eating Campbell's Beef Noodle soup when I was a little girl and that was several (more like many...) years ago.  They stopped carrying it where I live years ago and I was very disappointed.  I like a simple soup - not a big veggie lover - I was thrilled to find it on here and be able to order it so quickly and so easily!  Brought back many happy memories and I love the soup!  Thanks for selling it and for the quick wonderful service!
1.0,They  only sent ONE not SIX as described.,"Be Careful of this company. They advertised a Six pack of 12 oz Walden Farms Alfredo sauce , but only send ONE ! When I called they said , "" Oh sorry"" . I have demanded the other FIVE or a Full refund including shipping, They said they would get back to me on that.  I am not even going to try it now. It is a lot less at the grocery store."
5.0,Love!,"I love the Baby Beaba!  Yes, you can save yourself $150 and do the same thing with your steamer & food processor, but there's something to be said for the convenience of this product.  Compact and steams/purees all in the same appliance.  In fact, it's small enought that I leave it sitting on my kitchen counter.  If it weren't for this product, I probably would resort to the premade, store bought baby food, because who really has time to lug out bulky pots & the food processor????  Worth spending the extra money!"
1.0,Albacore,"Even at the sale price of $42, Costco beats it by $6 for the exact same item.  I should have done some cost research before buying a ""sale"" promo."
5.0,Best Stevia on the market BY FAR!,"I have to also disagree with the negative review.  I will say that I also experienced one box of this product where some of the packets were half-full... or even empty!  And I also had one or two packets that were clumpy as the other reviewer mentioned... so it's true... this company has a packaging issue.... hopefully they will resolve that soon!  Having said that.... this is BY FAR AND AWAY the best tasting Stevia on the market... and trust me... I've tried them all. The other nice thing is that it's bound to Agave Inulin... not dextrose as in some other Stevia extract products (e.g. Stevia in the Raw... probably the worst stevia product I've ever had!).  Pyure is a Stevia extract... not the pure powdered form.  Before this product, I had never been able to find a Stevia extract that had the same intense sweetness as the pure white powdered form of Stevia (e.g. SweetLeaf)... but this is it!  And the advantage Pyure offers is no bitter aftertaste... absolutely none!  I made hot cocoa with this last night.... 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, 2 packets Pyure, 1 teaspoon of raw coconut nectar (for a caramely flavor), a dash of vanilla, and 8oz milk.... AMAZING! The best hot cocoa I've ever had... sugared or otherwise.  Apparently this company is coming out with a Stevia syrup... so I'm anxious to try that.  I noticed one of the ingredients in the Pyure powder is ""Natural Flavor""... not sure what that is... but whatever it is... it tastes great!  Anyway... I never write reviews, but I am so stoked to find something that tastes every bit as good as sugar... if not better..... I just want this product to survive!"
5.0,Love these!,"If you like licorice (and in my experience people either love it or hate it) these are for you.  Suckable or soft enough to be chewable, they have excellent strong, sweet licorice flavor!  Addictive.  Altoids Curiously Strong Mints, Liquorice, 1.76-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12) "
1.0,Yuck!,"I'm the first one to post a negative review of these crackers.  However, I found them to have a bitter, ""off"", almost burned taste."
1.0,Tao of Tea ...!Don't get it,"This kind of tea not good ....!Taste and smell so wear it's not like tea ,and feel like some thing chemical."
5.0,Great Benefits For Your Digestive System,"I have a sensitive stomach so I have to be careful what I eat or else I have terrible stomach aches. I came across this tea at Target. It has a pleasant taste, it leaves a great refreshing after taste. I drink this about an hour before bed and I feel great after I drinking 1 cup. I also feel great in the morning; I don't feel sick anymore.  Warning* this tea makes me really sleepy. Which is great when I can't fall asleep :)"
5.0,Fantastic!,"This product tastes better than the regular Aloe Juice with sugar.  It is still sweet tasting, but not overpowering.  The delivery time was about 4 day with free super saver.  Couldn't ask for more!"
5.0,Yum yum yummy,These oats are so yummy! There's no difference in taste just no gluten yes! I will be getting more and suggesting them to all my gf friends!
1.0,Big Train chocolate Chai,I was truly disappointed.  If you are looking for Hot Chocolate than order this. There is nothing Chai about this product. Now I find out that this product is not eligible for return.  So I am stuck with 3 bags of hot chocolate.  This makes it hard for me to order other new items from Amazon don't want to waste anymore of my money.
5.0,"Cat Grass, no longer just for cats......","I have been growing this ""Cat Grass"" for my 3 little dog, however I don't have the nerve to tell them this is for cats.  I noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees, considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants I decided to grow my own. My little guys love this stuff, but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots & all.  I have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl. Trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster, much like your lawn.  As with your lawn I find that adding nutrients (Iron) to the grass it keeps it's beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass.  Don't know the exact reason my dogs like grass, it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets.  Guess you might say ""Dogs can't live on meat alone"" or something like that."
1.0,"Aweful, Not comparable to their old Queso.","Aweful, Especially compared to their old Four Cheese Queso, which our family loved. Why would they drop the old Four Cheese?"
5.0,night and day difference,"I breastfed my daughter for her first month of life, but she had severe problems with gas, bloating, and constipation.  We switched to a milk based formula, but the problem continued.  We then tried lactose free formula.  The problem lessened, but did not cease.  By her second bottle of Alimentum, she was using the bathroom without stimulation, her stomach was no longer hard and bloated, and she actually lays around smiling (without needing to be constantly held).  This was important as I have 3 other children.  My only regret is that she was 2 months old before we figured out how to keep her little tummy from hurting."
5.0,O.N.E is the number one!,"O.N.E. Coconut water, us holistically complete, biologically pure, natural isotonic beverage, is the ultimate hydrator. I mean, what other nature-made unprocessed substance can be used as an alternative IV to human blood plasma!? What other unprocessed fluid is, good-to-go, the next best thing to breast milk when you've just plum run out?  O.N.E Coconut water has been named Best Beverage for 2008 by Health Magazine in their June 2008 issue. The magazine reads: ""Best Beverage: O.N.E. Coconut Water. This slightly coconut flavored drink only has 60 calories per 11 ounces and replenishes electrolytes without artificial sweeteners. Great during a long bike ride.""  TRY O.N.E"
1.0,"product fine, seller not worth it","the seller should be ashamed to have sold all 24 mars bars that i ordered with their best by date only 28 days away. my boyfriend loves mars bars, when we are in the u.k. he eats one a day, and the expiration date doesn't matter, but this was meant to be a present to last a few months, maybe most of the year.  it is unbelievably frustrating that any professional company wouldn't rotate their stock, or consider the quality of the product they are shipping.  did they fall of a truck?  the mars bars are fine, for now. its the seller that you should avoid.  no excuses."
5.0,JoeyNaples,All I did different was add a box of zante currants during primary fermentation and two oz. of oak cubes for two months. Bottled it today and it was surprisingly pretty darn good. Can't beat the price per bottle ratio. I would compare it to most of the mid price range Montepulciano's out there.
1.0,Should be taken off the Market,This product contains propylene glycol in it.  It's known to cause cancer.  Do yourself a favour and just drink water!  If I could give this a negative star I would!
5.0,Addictive!,"I bought a whole bunch of these for a party and decided to open a bag to snack on. I literally couldn't stop eating them. Seriously, they're really good and more addictive than potato chips. They're excellent with hummus but it's like the hamburger helper joke, ""it tastes fine by itself!"". Excellent."
5.0,Good dead fish!,"While I wouldn't touch these with  a ten foot pole, my lovely wife loves them and so I have hunted and hunted for the John West Kippers!  I bought a case of them for her to eat while I'm NOT AT HOME and she loves me for it!"
1.0,does not look appealing to eat,"These sugar decorations look very similar to the picture, except, the surface is very rough, like an emery board, porous and this makes the color look very faded.  Overall, not attractive for something you would want to eat."
1.0,Very disappointed,I ordered 5 bags as my dog loves these dingos. All 5 bags were stale. The reason I say this is because of the crystallization of the meat in almost every dingo. It was obvious just looking at the contents through the bag that they were stale/old. I gave my dog one and he ate the part that wasn't crystalized but nothing more. Very disappointed that those 5 packages were even sent to anyone.
5.0,Great Snack,I've loved these things for years. They are great to have around as a quick snack or to grab one if you have to skip breakfast or something. It's nice to be able to buy them in bulk like this and just have them in the pantry. Good price too!
5.0,A surprising find,"I was grocery shopping two days ago at the local Wal-mart. My daughter went down the chip aisle looking, of course, for potato chips. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a bag that read Veggie Stix. I picked them up, glanced over them and said to myself ""Naw, probably tastes like crap."",and walked away. I was trying to find a snack for myself and everything was high in sodium or contained additives. So, I went back and decided to try the Veggie Stix. That was the best purchase that I made in the store that day. I got them home, tried them and had to force myself to stop eating them. And the BEST part is that when I let my grandkids try them they LOVED them. That was the only bag that I saw in the store that day, but believe me I will be checking to find out if it is an item that Wal-mart regularly stocks. If not I will be ordering from Amazon.com. Very Good."
5.0,great find,This is a wonderful alternative for regular brown sugar. Noone could tell the difference in taste or texture in the chocolate chip cookies.
1.0,wouldn't buy again,"Fast reliable company, but these caramello bars were kinda hard and the caramel didn't string like normal. Seemed like they'd been melted and refrigerated or old or something. They were edible for some, just not great. We did order zero bars and skors at the same time and they were great!"
5.0,Yummy shortbread cookie whether or not you need gluten free.,"Besides the fact that Amazon Subscribe and Save lets me get these for a more reasonable price whenever I want, they are completely yummy and a great crumbly texture whether or not you need something gluten free. (No soy or corn either!) You can proudly serve them to guests except those with nut allergies. I do wish Pamela's would offer just this cookie without the nuts. They do have a half chocolate/half vanilla variety, but I'm supposed to stay away from chocolate. The lemon style is good when you're in the mood, but sour kind of overpowers sweet with those defeating the purpose if you're craving something sweet."
5.0,Vinegar Is Magic!,"I have always heard about vinegar being great for cleaning, I'm sure I even used it to clean a microwave before, and I know I've soaked mildew-smelling clothes in vinegar water which was successful. But, it wasn't until I bought a steam mop (here on Amazon) and tackled my vinyl kitchen floors, that hadn't been well cleaned in years... that I discovered the MAGIC of vinegar. This steam mop left my floor so tacky and sticky, if I stood in one place, I felt like either the floor or my skin was going to come off. I took to the internet for a solution. Someone said to mop the floor with vinegar. Skeptical, but desperate, I did ONE mopping of the vinegar all over the kitchen floor. Just like that, as soon as it dried my floor was clean again. Extremely excited, I looked up more magic ways vinegar cleans. Then I ran out of vinegar, and had to buy some more. I have used it now to clean faux wood blinds that had grease & dust buildup, air return vent that had years of residue & dust build up, and stained toilets. I now keep a generic spray bottle of vinegar for cleaning anything. Alright, I am a believer now. Vinegar is magic."
1.0,Not very good soda,If you expect this to taste like dr peppeper you will be very disappointed like I was. Sad to say but this product really needs a taste review before they offer it to the public. Do not bother with it.
1.0,Not worth it,"These are really poor, skinny bully sticks.  I wrote a different review but it is not appearing.  I was able to cut these w/ household scissors and the dog finished it in 5 min.  I was very happy w/ previous orders of 6"" sticks and opted for these as they were 12""."
1.0,tastes stale and SMOTHERED in sugar salt and other stuff,"I thought what i ordered was nuts but instead got a stale tasting nut that was smothered in sugar, salt and many other unpleasant seasonings - I would not buy any Emerald product. I went to the store and checked - for the most part these green type containers are smothered nuts, not just nuts. Just basic walnuts - NO WAY; ingredients list seasoning (maltodextrin, yeast extract, carrots, garlic puree, celery, corn syrup solices, ascorbic acid, silicon dioxide, modified potato starch and natural flavorings and spices - not exactly all ingredients but you get the idea.  If you like them that way, enjoy and bon appetit. but if you want plain nuts, suggest you look elsewhere"
5.0,Szeged paprika,Excellent product . . . have used for many years.  Best of the commercially available paprikas.
5.0,Just what I expected.,"When my vanilla beans arrived, they were properly sealed to help maintain freshness. They were pliable (not hard as when i purchased directly from a store).The price was good. I will use the beans to make vanilla extract for personal use, and to give away as gifts. I will order more MV beans."
1.0,Do NOT buy.  Amazon is messing this up just like the Caramel.,"Do NOT buy this product.  Although Amazon is showing the Classic Hazelnut flavor, they are shipping the regular Hazelnut flavor.  The regular flavor is terrible and tastes like 1/2 peanut butter.  I wish Torani would stop messing with their flavors and/or test them with someone who can taste.  This tastes nothing like hazelnut.  It tastes like some kind of sweet chemical caramel flavor dominated by an off peanut butter taste.  If you want the REAL hazelnut taste, look for ""Classic"" Hazelnut.  Unfortunately, you cannot trust Amazon to ship you the right version.  I have purchased this several times in past years, but now I receive the regular Hazelnut.  This is just like the Caramel versus Classic Caramel debacle I experienced with Amazon last year.  If you use the subscribe and save, you will really be screwed because ALL grocery items are non-returnable.  I suggest you buy at a local grocery store to be sure you are getting the CLASSIC Hazelnut flavor.  Hopefully, in 6 months and enough customer complaints, Amazon will fix this.  They also need to fire their Torani rep who keeps supplying Amazon with the wrong product or is ""helping"" by switching to new formulations."
1.0,product is terrible,This product is terrible.  I use different types of bread mix in an automatic machine.  This bread did not rise at all.  I used 3 different packages out of the 6 and all were bad.  Basically the bread did not rise.  I switched to another brand and the loaf came out fine.  Be warned...  not a great product.  Basically cooked a loaf that looked like a softball.  DO NOT BUY!
5.0,Great tea,"My husband, and his family, LOVE this stuff.  I had to place several re-orders."
5.0,Great for Tortillas!,"This makes the best tortillas.  That is about all I use this for, so it lasts me awhile. Mine cost about 1/2 the price as listed here, but it was on sale where I bought it too."
1.0,Worst GF cereal EVER !!,I have been eating gluten free for 24 years.  I have tried many different produts and this by far is the worst cereal that I have been forced to ingest.
1.0,Goodlife makes cats sick,"I have given my cats Goodlife twice--the first time on purpose, the second on accident. All Goodlife products give my cats severe diarrhea. I only gave them a few pieces of this cat treat before I remembered that this brand was bad. It was not a pretty picture. I believe the problem might be all of the vegetables they have put in this. It looks great to people (vegies are supposed to be good, right?), but cats are obligate carnivores, and all this grain and vegies isn't good for them. Don't buy this unless you enjoy cleaning crap off of your floors."
5.0,"Awesome Product, Wish I Could Buy It In Stores","I don't know what is in these things, all I know is that our dog can't stop eating them. If her teeth didn't look so good since she I started giving her them (and if they weren't so easily digestible), I'd feel bad that I enabled a Checkups addiction in our dog. She's a forty-pound mutt, and I give her one-half of a Checkup after breakfast and dinner... if I wait too long to give her the treat, she starts whining and moaning until I pull one out of the container on the kitchen counter. Then she runs to her bed and waits not-so-patiently for it... yeah, she's a weird one. :-)  Like many other reviewers, I used to buy these at Costco for about half the price, but had been unable to find them at either of our local stores. I contacted both Diamond Pet Foods and Costco about it. Diamond said that Costco rotates the availability of many of is products, discontinuing items for a couple of months then bringing them back. They suggested I let Costco know that we liked product and wanted to see it on a permanent basis, but in the mean time that I could buy them from Amazon. Costco said the item had been discontinued, making no mention of it being a rotating product, but that they would pass my message on to their buyers. If you want to see these back on the shelves in Costco, send them an e-mail or drop in a note in the suggestion box at your local store about it. The more customers they hear from, the better the chance they will bring them back.  Diamond also suggested another one of their products, Bright Bites, which are similar to Checkups. They come in three flavors -- peppermint, wintergreen, and cinnamon -- and are available in retail stores (you can find a list on their web site) and Amazon. I don't know if our dog would dig the flavors, or if switching to them would be any less expensive than continuing to buy Checkups from Amazon, but maybe I'll try them out some time."
5.0,Healthiest/tastiest chocolate bar I have ever found,"This is the most delicious and healthiest chocolate bar I have ever tasted. It is sugar free, with 14 grams of fiber. There are no artificial sweeteners, and the taste is incredibly rich and creamy. I recommend buying the dark chocolate rather than the milk chocolate version because dark chocolate has all those important polyphenols. It is a little pricey but worth every penny."
5.0,I LOVE this candy and wish I could rate more stars!,"Since I was a kid I always loved eating this candy. But when I moved to a city that didn't sell these, I was devastated. Just a few days ago I recently came across one of these from a friend and have fallen in love with them all over again. I decided to look online for this candy and voila! I can't get enough of them! My all-time absolute favorite Mexican candy, and even possibly my favorite candy period!"
1.0,mailing disaster,Disappointed in the receipt of this product. This box was damaged and was leaking from several cans of the product. This was the worst I have ever received a product over the 10 plus years I have been ordering on line. I lost 3 cans of monster because of the damage and will never order this product through the mail again. The product is heavy so sending it back was more expensive then just keeping the damaged product.Only had a picture (no video) of damaged product or I would have sent a picture of damaged product.
1.0,all hype,Disappointed in the product...delivery was fine.  the sugar layer between the tasty chocolate and the vodka filling makes the product extra crunchy.  Frazer chocolates are fantastic...disappointed by this particular angle on it.
5.0,Coffee Break,"It is a good cup of Joe in the morning or any time of the day, smooth to the taste and not too strong."
5.0,Great for many uses,I have been using Kraft Cheese powder on my Spagetti and on popcorn for many many years. I have never found any other grated or powdered cheese that come even close to the taste of this cheese. Experiment and try it on many other things. even take plain Potato Chips and make them into a mouth watering treat.
1.0,The Salt & Pepper version is awful!,"We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that ""salt and pepper"" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again."
5.0,Good Popcorn,We only like white popcorn and since it's hard to find in the grocery store it's great to order this.  It was yummy and plentiful!  Recommend!
1.0,Choked & Barfed- see video," So this might be a gross video to watch... but I'm posting this so that others might see what they are in for.  I have an adult boxer dog with dental problems (gum overgrowth, as do most boxers) so I bought several dental health products-including these chews. I bought the large size chews, and for the first half of the chew (they are rectangular shaped), it worked great. Then towards the last bit, he didnt know what to do with it. It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.  I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard. I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.  I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece. I will stick with the latter shape in the future."
5.0,YUMMO!,"These are really delcious! In fact, I'm eating one at the moment. These cookies are great because i don't feel as guilty when eating one over an oreo. But remember! It is always safe to eat this like you were eating dessert (sparingly) because even though these cookies are some what nutriotious they are no apple. They are perfect as a little treat to jump start your day or a nice suprise for lunch. Overall, AWESOME"
5.0,Makes a really nice espresso,"This coffee has a great flavor, not too bitter, not too sweet.  It is an added bonus that it is organic.  The espresso comes out with a great crema and is a real pleasure."
5.0,Recommended by herbalist--love it.,"We've been drinking this tea for about 2 years.  It has a very mild taste--much like regular Lipton tea bags.  When I make Iced tea, I use 2 bags of this and 4 bags of Lipton for 6 quarts of water.  Makes delicious tea.  The herbalist told me it is very healthy to drink--has iron as well.  My kids love it too-as hot tea or iced tea.  This is not a raspberry flavored tea.  It is from the leaves, so you'll need to look elsewhere if you are looking for flavored tea. I like that there are no strings to deal with--or individual wrappers to peel off, just throw the whole bag in."
1.0,Failure after changes,Would love to give zero! My dog loved this rawhide but during 2012 everything changes. Ring is now half the size and it looks very cheap. What a disappointment from one of dogs favorites that I bought all the time to a cheap replacement that I will never buy again.  Not sure I would even trust this brand ever again.
1.0,YUCK!!!,This is the WORST tasting bread Ive EVER tasted!! It taste like crumbley WOOD chips. Im out $13.00. Everything went to the trash. I will just stick to fruits and veggies with lean meat. I know this company tried but this taste HORRIBLE!!
1.0,terrible tea,"I have used loose tea for over a dozen years.  Peach being my favorite. But though the price on this pound of loose peach, apricot tea is very good, don't waste your money.  This is the bitterest tasting tea I have ever bought.  I gave 1 star because the tea's color was good.  There was however, no aroma at all as the tea brewed. None what so ever. That should have my first clue."
5.0,Difficult to Find Locally - Then I Found This Delicious Thai Cooking Staple on Amazon!,"I like to include meals from many different cultures for our family, including dishes from Vietnam, Philippines and Thailand. I'd tried several different fish sauces from the grocery store that were awful and ended up in the compost pile.  Then I read about this brand in a Cook's Illustrated review from 2004 (yes, old, but accurate it turns out) giving Tiparos Fish Sauce their first place spot. I never could find the product locally however, then found it on Amazon, available with Prime free shipping and ordered it.  The sauce is delicious and it is now considered one of our Asian cooking staples, along with our  Lee Kum Kee Premium Oyster Sauce, 18-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 2) , our  Kikkoman Hoisin Sauce  and our  SHOYU, NAMA YAMAKI OG 5OZ  as well as the toasted sesame oil. While the bottles we received did not say to refrigerate after opening, we do,  just as we do our other, opened Asian sauces and oils."
5.0,A Pristine Tea,"I'm not a huge tea drinker, and so I'm very selective. I would describe this tea as pristine and pure. Its taste is subtle, yet vibrant. It will turn bitter if brewed too long, but fantastic when carefully prepared. I highly recommend this tea!"
5.0,the best there is,I have tried many drink mixes that use artifical sugar and find them all to have a horrible after taste.  This is the first one that really tastes good and I have tried the grape and lemonade flavors as well.  This brand is the one that I will stick with.  To really enjoy make sure your drink is good and cold.  This is certainly one way to get your daily water intake.
5.0,love my senseo,i love my senseo!!  Fresh coffee everytime for $0.25 a cup.  amazing value.  i am saving so much money that i used to spend at coffee shops. i could almost buy a new car with the extra money.  I am now saving to do just that!  All without sacrificing the great taste of a fresh cup of premium coffee whenever i want it!
1.0,Why is this listed in Gluten Free??,"In searching for Gluten Free, this product comes up numerous times. It is not Gluten Free..and for those with Celiac Disease, it's a definite food to avoid."
1.0,Cheaper at Target,Item is fine. It is just over priced. Buy smaller quantity at cheaper price at target. Cannot return. Save your money
5.0,Great Service,Super fast shipping. Nice presentation & packaged well. My in-laws loved it! Highly recommend.  Enjoy!
5.0,Yummmy,"Our 2 Egyptian mau's love it! Egyptians Mau are cats and our cats will eat  this all the time. why? Because they love it.Have I said they Love it? Well they do.Its because they love it,it is  what they love!."
5.0,Sesame Oil,"Considering our local store discontinued ALL Sesame Oil, I was very excited to find it here. Hain is my favorite brand!"
5.0,Best of the Best,"I discovered Virgil's Special Edition about six years ago and haven't looked back. Their regular root beer is not quite as good as their special edition (but still tasty), so I always go for the special edition when I can find it. Virgil's black cherry creme is also exceptionally good."
1.0,Bought the wrong stuff,I bought the wrong stuff and its non returnable.Thats bunk!!!Anybody interested in it?lol I'll have to pay a little closer attention next time!
5.0,Will not disappoint !!,This glaze is super smooth and yummy. I have tried all kinds and it is just as good as the ones I buy in Italy !!
5.0,very good,"Easy preparation, nice to have on shelf when you need a quick meal. Nice and chessy. Can either be a side dish or the main course.  Velveeta is always to be relied upon as one the great comfort food."
1.0,It's hollow!,"My dogs are 55lbs and 25lbs, within a few days they chewed through this bone which started to fall to pieces because it is hollow. If your dog is not a super chewer it might be good for them, but if your dogs gnaw nylabones into shanks like my dogs do, I would not recommend this."
5.0,Quaker oats,"These oats doesnt taste as good as i thought it would, but hopefully i will get used to them though..."
1.0,Smoke Paprika,"My mother uses it for allot of dishes, but this particular one, doesn't compare to anything she had.  It is now being used for a decoration on the spice shelf and I will never use it and ruin a dish again. I have tried using just a little bit, thinking it was stronger than her's. And I am a decent cook. But this does not taste like the smoke paprika that I have had in the past.  Sorry I don't recommend this product at all."
5.0,SO CHEWY GREAT FLAVORS,"I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.  While I was eating one,they were so fresh that they started bending in my hand.  I gave them to some of my co-workers to taste & they already want to order some.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy if you like a chewy, great tasting bar if you want something less chewy try the blueberry, pomagranite pistachio.  I'll be ordering more"
5.0,A favorite in our home,Most of my family is GFCF and so we have a hard time finding after-dinner treats for the kids.  Both of my girls (5 and 2) absolute love these cookies. We always have a batch cooked and waiting in the freezer.  They are also super easy to make.
5.0,Delicious!,"Exactly what I expected from Tim Horton's French vanilla Capuccino.  Thank you Amazon! Glad to know I don't have to travel all the way to Canada to get me some Timmis!! This is a very taste and delicious drink, and very inexpensive. Love it!"
5.0,Best cereal ever,"Ezekiel cereal is crunchy, tasty and fills you up and keeps you satisfied, unlike the light weight cereals on most store shelves. It's great! Try it with Soy milk and your favorite fruit for an even healthier breakfast."
1.0,Did not work,This product did not work. I think 2 moths got stuck to the trap and that could have been by chance...
5.0,pretty good cereal,"my brother got this cereal about a year ago and i took it from him and tried it and totally fell for it. kinda hard to come by since its no where near my home, have to travel far and wide in nyc to get this which is something i don't have time to do. now the 12 boxes of cereal should last me a long long time so its alot. but its a good cereal for the amount and price they're selling this for, perfect steal."
5.0,LOVE IT!!,I LOVE the taste of this cashew butter! It is very sweet and has an extremely creamy and smooth texture! I use it often on my GF muffins I make- the taste is not predominate but goes with all flavors very well!
5.0,Perfect nutrition,I loved the fact that I was able to purchase 6 of this size.  These unhulled seeds are very good and I use them daily to add to my fruits and other dises.  I will definitely purchase them again.
1.0,disappointed,I have been looking for a ground organic espresso coffee in a dark roast that comes in bulk.  The problem is that this coffee is not ground fine enough to produce a strong coffee in an espresso maker.  It is fine for a french press or regular coffee pot.  So I am still looking.
5.0,Simply the best,"As a moderate peanut butter eater, I never thought I would fall so in love with any brand of peanut butter....but I blissfully have!  White Chocolate Wonderful is....in my opinion, God's greatest gift to mankind :P  At my local store, they don't carry too many PB & Co peanut butters at a time, so today, I literally bought them out of this.  It is THAT good.  Also, as a vegan, I love that I can have something that is so delicious and still appropriate to my diet.  This product is also very low on ingredients and not nearly as highly processed as most of the brands out there."
1.0,bad gum,"10 pellets of gum for 18.99 is a joke. I must have been in stupid ville to order this. I received the gum, 1 pack with 10 pieces of gum. Honestly the gum is bad tasting and it last about as long, 1 min. Don't buy this product. This is a rip off!!!!!!!!!"
5.0,Real Argentine Dulce de Leche,This is an exceptional fine and high quality Dulce de Leche just like is served over most of Argentina.
5.0,Good substitute for the real thing.,"I bought it based on the other reviewers and am very pleased with taste. It might be better soaked (rehydrated) in a little water but it's so addicting dry, right out of the package."
1.0,FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!,"I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: [...]. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz ""Angel hair"" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that ""THIS IS OUR POLICY"" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ ""Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???"
1.0,I've had bottled water with more flavor.,"I'd label this as flavored water, but bottled water has more flavor. I noticed when I poured it into a sauce pan for heating it up, almost half, maybe more, was just water. Upon actually eating it, I couldn't help but notice what little bit of flavor there was tasted like regular olive oil (as opposed to the ""Extra Virgin olive oil listed in the ingredients). I'd like to think it was a bad batch, but even then you'd think quality control was better than that. Either way, I'd recommend buying a single container locally and trying that before buying a bulk quantity."
1.0,What A WASTE OF MONEY DO NOT BUY!!,"This is not the first time I have purchased this product..The first time the product came packaged very nicely in a styrofoam box and was frozen,,,and after I had cooked it it was great..Anyway this time when I got the roast the first thing iI noticed was it came in a plain box with only 2 melted ice packs and in some sort of silver colored material.....The meat was discolored on one end and it smelled horrible!!!OMG what a waste..The meat was sooo bad it looked like it had been shipped and had turned rotten before it was shipped!!! I am sorry if my grammer is rather jumbled..But I am very upset....Shame on this company for sending a customer rotten meat!! Please do not under any circumstances buy from this company ever!! :("
1.0,Not what is described,Received in a small package. Feathers looked like regular bird feathers. Thin not the size they described they would not even stay on the Eiffel towers I bought. Do not suggest this product. Still waiting for my refund.
5.0,Great seeds!,"Have not sampled a harvest yet as it's to soon but the seeds are good snd fresh, my seedlings appear before estimated germination on package wich is great!!  UPDATE June 10th 2012:  Doing great and I have only used ONE SEED so far :D  I have enjoyed alot of fresh kale chips so far and even made a Kale Avocado salad too. I am very happy with my seeds and the plant it has produced!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  I will add a photo that will be viewable where the seed packet photo is Above!"
1.0,Looks like 2-star cocoa being sold as 4 1/2-star cocoa... don't buy it!,"Ordered a package of this cocoa around April 25th 2011.  It was fabulous.  Worthy of the 4 1/2 stars rating. Deep rich color.  Well sealed.  So good we needed to reorder about a month later.  So went back to same amazon site, same picture and did reorder.  This time however, upon arrival it was not same company, packaging or label (hokey looking)... Instead of ""Frontier"" it said ""Organic Herbal Essence"".  Upon further investigation I went to my Amazon history and noticed first batch came from Sold by: Bangalla Organic Wholesale LLC and second batch came from Sold by: Organic Herbal Essence.  Keep in mind that Organic Herbal Essence is the cocoa that sells on Amazon that is only rated at 2-stars:[...]  I checked and can't return it. Called Organic Hebal Essence during business hours, left message, no one returned my call.  My opinion is just slapping a tiny white Avery label on the bag with tiny print (really tiny) that says ""Frontier Cocoa"" doesn't eliminate the huge color label on the bag that says ""Organic Herbal Essence... Dutch Cocoa"".  it certainly doesn't turn a 2-star cocoa into a 4 1/2 star cocoa.  My main frustration is it is obviously a different company and different packaging, but no explaination or offer to refund. Seems like a ""bait and switch"".  My advice; take a pass on this one until they get it sorted out."
1.0,Poor choices of flavors,"I ordered this hoping to have diff flavors of coffee for our office, needless to say I get 2 French Vanilla and 2 Hazelnut and the rest of them are decaf and bold blends.  Really bold blends?  If I wanted bold I can buy that at the grocery store I wanted the flavored coffee's so from now on I will buy them on ebay where I do get the 24 different flavors of coffee.  This was a epic fail order :(  Normally I never have anything bad to say about Amazon and some of their shippers but this one well it hit bottom."
1.0,"Burnt, Brown and at times Bitter","Earlier, I had regular Keenan Pistachio with shell I found them excellent. But this one is exactly 180 degrees. They are brown, burnt and at times bitter. Taste is much worse that with shell. I will never order this type again. I still have to take care of 5 unopened bags."
5.0,Only way to get these where we live!!!,"All the local grocery stores/chain stores used to carry Lays Salt and Vinegar chips - which are my husband and daughter's favorite! Then they were NO where to be found!! I live in LARGE metropolitan area in TEXAS!!! I wrote to Frito-Lay - and they were NOT helpful - they just said ""not all items are available in all markets and you cannot direct order""  Doing a search for the individual packs of Baked Lays for school lunches (another impossible to find item) - I found these! My family is sooooo happy!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
5.0,"Lipton Black Tea, Tea Bags",Great Product.  I ordered these tea bags as I brew a lot of tea.  Everyday there is someone in my family who either wants a cup of hot tea or a glass of iced tea.  It is so handy having this item at our reach.  I received this order in perfect condition and on time.
1.0,Better be double stuffed with gold...,at that price.  I'm guessing that you guys are aiming for those of us that can't get down to the store for our double stuffs...
1.0,A hard candy,"I sent this to my niece and nephew who love gummy bears.  They won't touch it.  The gummy bears are too hard for them.  If you want the traditional gummy bears that are bendable and chewy, do not buy!!!"
1.0,AWFUL,"I did not purchase mine from Amazon, but I did base my purchase on reviews I had seen on both Amazon & another site, which were all glowing.  So I thought it was fair to give another point of view.  I love popcorn more than any other food.  This is possibly the worst popcorn I have ever had.  Normally, I use canola or peanut oil, fresh locally grown corn, & sea salt.  It is absolutely delicious with very few hulls or unpopped kernels.  It is much better (& better for you) than microwave or any other popping method using oil.  This stuff was stale, & had way too much sodium.  The coconut oil mixture was disgusting. The taste was so bad that I threw the rest of it away after a few handfuls.  I had split the original batch in half, & gave 1/2 to my neighbor, who usually will eat anything.  Even she thought it was poor quality.  Now I'm stuck with 2 boxes of this junk.  I gave it 1 star because every kernel did pop, and the cooking time was quick.  But I'm going back to, & sticking with, my old method.  I think it must be the locally grown corn (FRESH!) that spoiled me."
5.0,I love this stuff,"Whenever I start getting a sensation of a burning sinus (which is fairly often), I drink one of these and the next day the burning sensation is either gone or the intensity of the burning is down by a lot. It works even if I just put a teabag in room temperature water. And it tastes pretty good too!"
5.0,By Chi's Favs,I don't know what it is about these little treats but she literally goes crazy for them!  I try to feed her all natural and organic foods and Blue Buffalo is premium.  I also feed her the small breed dry food and wet and she loves those as well.  Wish they were a bit cheaper tho!
1.0,Does not live up to expectations.,"I would not recommend this syrup to people looking for a good authentic bubblegum syrup. The taste is really off, and the syrup does not absorb into the ice very well. There is a good flavor similar very similar to bubblegum on Amazon, called Jelly Belly Tutti Fruitti."
5.0,Best there is...,"There really is a difference and this stuff is awesome.  A couple tips...follow directions for mixing exactly as they instruct.  What I found out works best is to take the egg out of the fridge an hour or so ahead of time to come up to room temperature before mixing with water.  Also if possible, let mixture stand about 30 minutes or so before using for waffles.  Extremely light crisp and delightful waffles."
1.0,Don't be fooled,"There's a stark disconnect between the front of the product's packaging (which promises ""Iced Green Tea"" with honey and natural fruit flavors) and the actual product. Lipton could conceivably have marketed convenient packets of gunpowder green tea, with its characteristic bitterness subtly curbed by tiny amounts of honey and fruit oils. Such a product might have been a hit with the health-obsessed, ingredient-conscious crowd that already enjoys unsweetened tea. Instead, they decided to go for a more mainstream audience: people who crave sweet-as-soda beverages, but want to feel good about what they're drinking.  The result is a product that's almost indistinguishable from  Sugar Free Kool-Aid , but will likely be brought to market at a much higher price point based on its supposed healthfulness. The Lipton Stix packaging brags that (unlike Kool-Aid) it's got ""no aspartame""--because it uses the artificial sweetener sucralose (aka Splenda) instead. Yes, green tea powder is the third ingredient (after honey granules and citric acid)--but to give you an idea of how much tea there is in this ""tea mix,"" a chart on the side brags about Lipton Stix containing 60mg of flavonoids per serving, comparing favorably to cranberry juice and orange juice. This is an extremely selective comparison. Most pertinently, a cup of tea typically contains anywhere from 200mg to 1000mg of flavonoids, depending on the variety, density, and brewing process.  Now, it's one thing to emphasize a product's naturalness (""natural flavors,"" ""made with real ingredients,"" ""tea & honey,"" ""real fruit flavors"") without mentioning the artificial sweetener anywhere other than the ingredient list. But there's one claim that I believe to be overtly deceptive: ""sweetened with honey."" Let's examine that. Honey is listed in the ingredients as ""Honey granules (sugar, honey),"" which means that there's actually at least as much sugar as honey in the product. A half-packet serving has ~1g of sugars, so even under the generous assumption that there's as much honey as pure sugar, there's only about half a gram of honey per serving. Is it conceivable that you could detect half a gram of honey in 8oz of water? Certainly not if you add enough sucralose to make that 8oz of water taste as sweet as fruit juice (~25g of sugars).  So to summarize: At best, honey accounts for 1/50th of the sweetness in Lipton Stix that the sucralose provides. Shame on you, Lipton."
5.0,Awesome,"This is an awesome kit. I thought the price was a little high until I got the kit. I love this soup so I risked the price and it is well worth it.  I have already made 2 batches and have plenty of stuff to make it at least a couple or few more times.  The Bowls are very nice a hard plastic and a nice big hearty size. I really like the design they look like they are from a chinese resteraunt.  I like the recipe being laminated it makes it very easy to use and keep clean.  As for the soup it is delicious it taste like a resteraunt. You get all the stuff but cornstarch and meat and chicken stock. But you probably already have all that stuff.  The soup is easy to make and come out great, the recipe add a little more rice vinegar than I like but no bid deal I put less in the second time and it tasted just like my local resteraunts soup. I eat this soup at every chinese resteraunt I go to and this is better than 75% of the resteraunts i've tried.  I highly recommend this kit, it is really great."
5.0,classic and hard to find in stores,"not sure why stores stopped carrying this in western Washington, but i HAD to get me some, been a favorite since i was 10. so glad to find it online, and for a great price at amazon. my favorite way to eat this is with some chili flavored Frito's."
1.0,They want to fool you with the size of the box,Don't be fooled with the size of the box. Exactly 40% of that is just a paper. I hate when manufactures try to fool customers increasing the visible size of the package.
5.0,Good bread for machine,Love to make this bread in our bread machine.  This with soup makes for a good meal when the weather is cold.  Very tasty bread - don't be scared by the Barley in the title.
5.0,"Sweet, nutty, and delicious","How much can be said about a cereal?  Crunchy Nut lives up to it's name.  The O's are crunchy and covered with nuts.  Together they create a sweet taste with a little bit of saltiness.  It's a little on the sugary side, but still tasty for adults.  I swear this combination and taste had been done before in a long lost cereal of whose name I can't remember."
1.0,Absolute junk. Waste of money,"This product has totally fallen apart over the past year, it no longer comes out of the bottle in drops. It squirts out like mustard. It has all the sweetening power  of water. Complete waste of money. Used almost all of one whole bottle to sweeten one cup of coffee and still had to add a Splenda packet besides. Throwing out remaing bottles. Don't waste your money"
1.0,Buy through Amazon - there web site. Seeds not so good,"I bought these seeds through wheatgrasskit web site - it is not a secure web site. I was stupid  bought anyways though that site and had false credit card purchases made within 2 days of purchase.  Also I grow my wheatgrass by hydroponic, and the seeds don't so so well. They are slow to spout, the roots are rotting quicker than the growth. So I'm not getting a tall grass to juice with plus I have to watch the mold. Also I thought all seeds would be equal, but even the taste seems different and my stomach has to have smaller amounts of juice. My biggest regret is purchased 20lbs because I juice ALOT, and regret buying from this vender.  I hope other buyers have better succes. Mine was just not so good."
1.0,Find something else,Maybe I put it on the wrong thing but I did not like it at all. It gave my porkchops a strange taste. I used it twice and I am scared to use it again. Don't want to ruin anymore food.
5.0,Love it!!,These are great. The canisters you get in the store are too bulky for my diaper bag and these I can just throw in and go. I tried putting the ones from the canister in a ziploc bag instead and they lost there freshness compared to these. Great product.
5.0,"Hard to find, worth the price","None of the large grocery chains in CA carry Wheatena any more. The small chain at which I used to buy it no longer carries it. The on-line price is higher than other hot cereals but (one exception) none can compare for combination of flavor, fiber, texture and healthfulness. It knocks the spots off big sellers like Cream of Wheat. I have been eating and enjoying Wheatena for 70 years and counting. Only real competition is steel-cut oatmeal, Scottish style--and that's equally expensive."
5.0,Excellent Product.,This is a very good product with excellent coconut smell. I use it to subsitute butter to make bread and cake and the taste does not have any difference. Apart from good taste and it is a very healthy food. My family love it.
5.0,roland tahini,"fresh and great tasting. quick shipping. ALL GOOD. good price as well. ive made hummus with this product, and i use it as a spread for my toast and bagels. it only takes a little because it spreads out. make sure you stir the tahini before using as any regular user knows that the oils settle."
5.0,PERFECT!,"Perfect tool for any musicians trying to make recording much easier at an affordable price. Easy to open plastic case, medium sized, durable (People have said that the plastic body feels cheap and feels easy to break but it's not true. The Icicle's plastic body feels durable and won't break if you're not clumsy with it or break it on purpose). I only wished that the ""Gain Control"" had numbers or indications of levels so I can turn the knob to the correct position for recording and remember it instead of guessing all the time. Sound quality is FLAWLESS! No buzzing noises or anything picked up really...just nice crispy sound recorded through a good quality microphone is all I hear. I hear no difference in it with an Icicle or a Mixer"
5.0,I.M.Healthy Soynut Butter,"I haven't tried any other soy butter brands. I like this brand. It is a little dry and thick, but it isn't real peanut butter. It has a good flavor. Works good on crackers and bread."
1.0,Tastes like soapy water,I tried the blackberry Hint and loved it.  I hurried up and ordered 4 other flavors.  The first one I tried was the lime.  It really just tastes like soapy water.  I hope the rest aren't as disappointing.
5.0,Also good for baking,This oat bran is as finely ground as Quaker's and is less expensive. Finely ground oat bran is best for baking. (I use the recipes in The Oat Bran Baking Book by Nancy Baggett & Ruth Glick which you can find used here on Amazon.)  Mother's Oat Bran also makes a smooth and delicious hot cereal. Make it with  milk instead of water for better flavor and creaminess.
1.0,Too much garlic!,"I served these with a nice dinner -- they fluffed up well and look terrific.  But no one could stand THAT much garlic in them!  Just a hint of garlic is ok but these tasted like they were BATHED in garlic .... and they ended up in the dogs' bowls... but the dogs liked them, which didn't surprise me... since they would also eat roadkill."
5.0,This Tea is Amazing!!!!!,This is the most Amazing Jasmine Green Tea that I have ever encountered!  You can really taste the jasmine flowers on many levels.  Sitting  and drinking this cup of tea is both a peaceful and evocative experience!  And I love that it is fair trade and organic.  Thank you to the company for developing such a Beautiful tea  :)
5.0,Quick And Awesome,I have been a fan of this Uncle Ben's flavor for nearly 20 years. Quick and easy to prepare and it goes with any dish. Great flavor and it freezes well with leftovers. Works well in soups! Hard to find in the stores. Order a couple cases. You'll love it!
5.0,Best Popcorn to-date!,"I too experienced a little hiccup with my first batch of Great Northern Premium popped corn, however, it turned out to be me ""undercooking"" it that made it taste chewy an unappetizing.  I started my first 1/3 cup batch at 2.30 minutes, trying not to burn it, however, with my second and all subsequent batches, I am using a Nordic Ware popping bowl ( Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup  also bought here on Amazon.com) in our 1000W microwave at 3.05 minutes and it has come out consistently crisp, light and full of flavor each and every time with no burning.  Furthermore, I have almost NO kernels left in the bottom of the bowl.  The Nordic Ware bowl allows you to cook without the need for oils of any kind, a plus for the health-conscience.  To top it off, a little I Can't Believe it's Not Butter 0 calorie spray a few times on top with a light sprinkle of sea salt, a brisk shake to stir it in and you will have the most flavorful, guilt-free movie-time treat, period!  I love this stuff - we are eating two bowls a night, so the size of the bag does not scare us.  I would recommend moving the kernels to an airtight container however, to keep them fresh.  Great Northern, if you are reading this, a resealable bag would be a nice touch to keep the large bag sealed...  Other than that, keep making flawless popcorn kernels, thanks!"
5.0,Great Wine Kit,"I've ordered this kit before. And let me say it is one of the best around for the price. In fact if you signup for delivery every few months you can get an even better deal and FREE FREIGHT you can't beat a deal like that. The kit produces one of the best tasting wines around, even better than some of the more expencive kits."
5.0,A *must-have* household staple,"This sauce is medium heat for everyday use.  It has an excellent roasted pepper flavor, and there is *NO VINEGAR* to get in the way.  Consequently, you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce...versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it.  An every-day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue.  This is not a boutique novelty, it's a household staple.  The 32 oz. size is the right size for a hot sauce household.  You want good?  Try Tapatio on cottage cheese.  You'll never eat cottage cheese any other way again, I promise.  I use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream, but my personal favorite applications of Tapatio are:  eggs potatoes pizza anything creole (forget tabasco!) cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course...Mex  In my opinion, this is the best sauce in your local grocery store."
1.0,EXPIRED!!!!,I bought this item which is a four pack on March the third and it is a four pack which had the expiration date of Jan 2011.. so I now have 4 bottles that are useless and I have been told I can not return per their policy. I want some more.. but obviously some that is NOT out of date!!  Anyone know how to get an exchange on this item??
5.0,My Favourite for drinking black,My very fav tassimo blend for drinking black. It is smooth and subtaly strong with no bitterness and the whipping on top  make its seem lighter.
1.0,Disappointed with the Packaging,"These are delicious and hot, but they were very poorly packaged. About 70% of the rings are broken into small pieces. I paid for Funyun RINGS, not Funyun particles.  If a vendor has so little respect for his customers as to not correct the problem even after other reviewers have also given negative reviews for the same reason, they are hopeless in my opinion.  I should have heeded the warning, but unfortunately, these are hard to find. I rolled the dice hoping they'd addressed the problem, and I lost.  I will not purchase from this vendor again."
1.0,No longer as advertised,"The first two cases I bought were very satisfactory. I mixed the coconut milk into a shake, along with bananas and cocoa and drank it straight. It was great, very fresh. I could use it on anything: salads, etc. The third case I bought had a completely different texture, smooth and creamy versus the flaky, part solid/part liquid texture of the first two cases. Unsure about it, I put a sparing amount in my shake. Minutes later, my stomach starting to act up. It couldn't digest this coconut milk properly. My wife's stomach's reaction was even worse than mine. (I've also had a similar reaction before with another brand of coconut milk, bought much less expensively at an Asian grocery). So then I looked at the ingredients, and lo and behold, there were at the end: ""guar gum, stabilizers."" Looking back at the description of this item here on Amazon, I see it says ""No Preservatives. No Stabilizers."" I also have found from other reviews that people have discovered the ingredients have changed. A once-great product is no longer, and in fact, is not as advertised."
5.0,Ice Breakers Gum,"I used to be able to buy this gum in bulk at the wholesale warehouses. Since they no longer carry it, I was very glad to be able to find it on line. I love and only chew Ice Breakers brand gum. It arrived in timely manner and I was very pleased and will order from this seller again."
5.0,Excellent Raisins,"These raisins are are larger, plumper and moister than most other raisins. They stay fresh and moist even after they have been opened for several days. These are much better than the ""usual"" Sunmaid raisins and are a good value when compared to other brands of deluxe raisins. I would definitely buy again."
5.0,Good Hot Stuff!!!,"I love this product, the nice thing, is that you can control how hot you make your desired food!!! I use it just about every day :) I love it!!!"
5.0,Great if delivery time is flexible,"If you need flowers at a certain time, dont get these. But if you can be a little flexible these are amazing. Great price and they stayed vibrant for a couple weeks. Absolutely amazing."
1.0,Not worth the price,"Go to a major food chain (like shop rite, pathmark) and you can purchase these for less (and you won't have to buy 12 of them. Amazon's food is never a better bargain - especially when you have to buy such a large quantity."
5.0,Bonkers over greenies!,"We had a dog for nearly 16 years, who had terrible teeth and foul breath, and ended up needing surgery to remove 19 teeth.  She had infections under the teeth into the bone beneath.  She ended up with kidney disease and we lost her several months ago.  We now have a 1 year old pit/lab mix, Daisy, who will not let us brush her teeth, and I am determined to keep her teeth healthy.  Daisy gets one regular greenie (she weighs 57#) after her evening meal.  Daisy goes bonkers when I open the package, dancing all around the kitchen.  She loves them so much. Daisy gulps down her food, but the texture of the greenies forces her to take her time when she eats them.  So far her breath is not even noticeable, and her teeth are pearly white.  Also, I never give her wet food, which sticks to her teeth.  And, she chews on nylabones throughout the day.  Buying this through amazon.com saves me at least $10, so I am happy to get this online.  The packages always arrive on time and in good shape.  When the weather was very hot and humid here, I did get one box where some of the greenies were stuck together, but the individual greenies were still in good shape.  I highly recommend this product."
5.0,Skippy Peanut Buter 0.5 ounce cups,This 100 pack of Skippy Peanut Butter was ordered for a church food pantry. The product arrived after about 4 weeks and was in good condition. This is a great value and the church was happy.
5.0,great coconut oil!,"There is nothing wrong w/ this coconut oil!... just perfect, and local! My family has been adding into my grandfather's diet and his energy level is up with less dementia symptoms! You can heat this at a higher heat and will still benefit you!"
1.0,not preserve,"the item that I ordered was not what I expected. it was not a preserve as preserve should be. I would not reccomend this item to anyone,when you receive hero's quince preserve notify me.  thanks   giglio"
5.0,"Wonderful on grilled items, in salads","A friend who visits family in Greece each year gave me my first Cavendar's Greek Seasoning.  It is great on grilled meats and vetetables and in salads.  Brush small pita with oil and sprinkle Cavendar's Greek Season, then bake in oven until crisp - better than any crackers you can buy.  I now order it to give away when guests ask about the pita bread toasts."
1.0,Made in China,These bars are hard as a rock and who knows what's really in them if they are made in China.  I threw mine out when I realized where they came from.  Why doesn't Amazon disclose country of manufacture?  And shame on this company!
1.0,Just what were they thinking?!,"For years this was my go-to bar providing quality, character, value, availability.  Don't misunderstand, I'm not suggesting that it was ever something more than it was but the bottom line is that whether you are a chocolate snob or a casual chocolate lover, you knew that this was simply excellent chocolate for the price.  Nearly boutique chocolate level flavor that you could pick up for half the price.  But to my shock the new recipe is simply garbage. Mundane, flat, lacking any punch. What the !@#% was Lindt thinking?  I, along with many others, will have to seek a new replacement for a serviceable bar that the Lindt 70% so faithfully provided for years.  Lindt, shame on you.  You lost a good percentage of your loyal base...and all for what? Sadly nothing, because its not as if this new formula will appeal to a 'broader audience'--it will not."
1.0,Absolutely terrible,This stuff is terrible. I am throwing the bottle away. It has no wasabi taste whatsoever. None. Not even a mild kick. All it tastes like is egg yolk.
5.0,Great espresso from a pod? Yes!,"I have had plenty of espresso in coffeeshops that was inferior to Lavazza pods.  Good, strong, flavorful blend -- in a convenient and reliable package. That said, it's not the same as just-ground, perfectly tamped coffee run through a $10,000 machine -- but it's a great daily cup."
5.0,Best Coffee Ever,"If you have been looking for a rich, full flavored, strong coffee that is never bitter, then Foglifter is the one you want.  Ground or whole bean, they are both great. I just wish they made it in a T disk for my Tassimo machine. Strong smooth coffee."
5.0,meat marinade,"My family uses Kraft Good Seasons Cheese Garlic Salad Dressing and Recipe Mix as a marinade for barbequed flank steak. It's becomming very difficult to find the product in stores so I now order it on amazon.com for a very reduced cost. Recipe: Combine about 1/2 cup salad oil with one or two packages of the powdered mix in a one gallon size ziplock bag, add meat, marinade 2 hours, barbeque and eat. Delicious!"
5.0,cat toys,This is one of the best cat toys we have ever bought. It keeps your cat entertained and you can just sit back and watch all the fun they have with this toy.
5.0,Coco Lopez Cream of Coconut,"I have been using it for many years. THE BEST THING FOR PINA COLADA AND FOR COCONUT FLAN. I am glad I was able to find it in Amazon because some times is not easy to find. Be aware that Liquor stores have it in the mix drink section,"
1.0,Oops,"I bought chocolate through the mail in August in New Mexico.  I didn't even think about the fact that it would need to be insulated/refrigerated.  When it arrived, it was melted.  I do however remember the chocolate bar being delicious the last time I had it...alas....not this time."
5.0,Good blueberry flavored agave nectar,"I haven't tried this on fruit yet- but the foiled insert on the lid had a bit that I tasted, and the flavor was really good- I can see this being really great on berries.  I don't drink sweetened tea, but it would probably work quite well.  This flavor is good- one of the better ones I've tried so far."
1.0,Box arrived busted,"The box was busted when I recived it and five of the drinks had busted open and leaked all over the box, I am very unhappy with this because now I have five empty cans that I spent my money on that were messed up."
1.0,Tasteless and hard,"Aaah, gluten free pasta.  Is it the impossible dream for those who mustn't have wheat?  Well, don't bother with this high-priced attempt.  The flavor is reminiscent of wallboard, the texture is like half-cooked pasta, and the actual protein content is negligible.  So far the only palatable wheat-free pasta I've found is the stuff from Tr. Joe's made of corn.  Wish I could buy that online!"
5.0,Delicious!,"These really taste like absinthe, or at least like black licorice.  The packaging is adorable, and the tin is small enough to fit into the tiniest of purses. My mom loved these as a stocking stuffer this year!"
5.0,Best Taste / Best Value,"The Hormel Compleats Teriyaki Chicken with Rice (10 oz Microwave Bowl) has the best taste and best vaule of the Hormel prepared meals.  It is my favorite!!!  The convenience to have such a tasty, healthy meal in just a minute is awesome for a busy person like myself on the run all the time.  :) Great job Hormel!!!"
1.0,Dog didn't Like,Unfortunately my dog didn't go for this product. The bone casing was pretty hard for her to get through and the stuffing wasn't enticing enough for her to even try. She is a Shitzu but has no problem with hard bones or treats. She carried this one around for a couple of hours and then never bothered with it again.
5.0,OOOO Long TEEE ;),"I really like this tea.  I originally bought the package which comes with 6 boxes containing 18 teabags each.  When that was gone, I ordered the 100 count box.  I am told that oolong tea is good for you, so I'm glad this white peach type is to my liking."
5.0,"A little pricey, but worth it","Although I am something of a circus peanut connoisseur, this was my first experience with colored (as in ""other than orange"") circus peanuts, and it was quite a good one. The peanuts arrived in good shape in a cellophane bag with a ""Sweet Gourmet"" sticker on it. (A little confusing, as the listing shows them ""by Spangler."") I didn't realize until I read up on the history of circus peanuts that they're supposed to be banana-flavored; I always thought it was just some unique circus peanut flavor. In this case, the orange peanuts are regular flavor; the yellow ones are obviously lemon (and my least favorite, despite my love of lemons); the pink ones are a subtle cherry; and the white ones...oh, the white ones. Vanilla. Creamy, sugary deliciousness. Wow. If I could order just vanilla, I might never go back to pseudo-banana.  The price was reasonable for such quality, but the shipping (twice the price of the product) was not. But I suppose that's the fault of the shipping company, and it's probably a good thing anyway. If shipping were, say, free, I'd be well on my way to diabetes. This way, I'll only order these peanuts as an occasional special treat. And a treat they are!"
1.0,Not healthy,"This product should be described clearly at the front of the package (not the inside after it is revealed)that it contains partially hydrogenated oil. Also, I feel that it should not be in the ""organic & natural"" section of Amazon's grocery."
5.0,Delicious!,"Great chocolate, the italian is better than the german one but still all good!!! I will buy it again any time. It is simply great. You have to try it. ;P"
5.0,Exactly What I Wanted,"I spent last summer in Japan, and recently found myself missing the refreshing taste of barley tea.  The tea tastes exactly as I remembered. I dropped a single bag in a liter of water and left it in the fridge for two hours, and there was my tea.  The smell of the tea bags pre-tea is a bit offputting, but it's well worth putting up with for the tea.  Also, the bags are not for individual cups, but for pots or pitchers. This is what I wanted, but make sure you aren't expecting smaller tea-bags made for individual cups.  Also, good deal for the price in my opinion."
5.0,Great Jerky!,I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
5.0,"yum, yum","Cooked up a bag, divided it in containers and froze them.  This week I made hummus.  It was excellent.  The beans cooked up nice."
1.0,Drastic Reduction in Product Size,"I have been happily buying this product for more than a year, but was recently dismayed to receive back to back shipments containing bones that were 50-60% smaller than the ones I had been receiving. The packaging remained the same as before, but the contents were no longer as advertised on the package or in the description provided at Amazon."
5.0,Perfect transaction!!,I was very happy to find this hard to find product in time for Christmas.  Fast shipping of a great product!
1.0,Misleading - at best.,"When we bought this item, it was because we did a search for ""Vermicelli"". On the package, in fine print, it says ""enriched macaroni product"". This is not appropriate when it comes to selling a product. If I want a macaroni product, I will go to the macaroni section..."
5.0,desperate!!,I LOVE these muffins!!  We're hooked on them in our house!  What's the hold up?  When will they be back in stock?
5.0,Rexie loves these!!,"I did check their website and it states all their products are made in USA.  I was concerned when I didn't see it on the package.  Rexie loves these and knows enough to chew things until he has tiny bite sized pieces to swallow thankfully as I gather most chews have a choking risk.  He looks better since he refused his commercial 4 and 5* dog kibble and canned foods.  I am now giving him low fat filet mignon which is reasonably priced, sirloin, fat removed lamb chops and chicken breast skinless.  He gets some supplements and nourishing chews.  He is learning to eat vegetables slowly but surely.  His coat is much softer and actually shimmers for the first time since we got him!"
1.0,$1.99 at Walmart,Like the product not the price at Amazon. Just as an FYI this rice is $1.99 at Walmart. Avoid the hassle of buying it online.
1.0,The food was rotten,"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it."
5.0,Delicious,"I lived in Ireland for 10 years, and really enjoyed having pinhead (steel-cut) oatmeal for breakfast.  The cost of such cereal in the U.S. is prohibitive, so I was glad to see it for sale on Amazon.com, and bought 12 bags!  Still has a great taste, and the expiration date is well in the future."
5.0,An excellent beginner's kit,"In general, I'd recommend that you would go to a local brewing store and work out exactly what you need and want to get started brewing your own beer. You'd likely end up with a setup that is pretty similar to this one. That leaves price and flexibility as the main issues. Glancing at a brewing catalog, it looks like this setup isn't a bad deal pricewise. And of course if you don't have a local brewing store, then buying this one is that much easier. Do compare the items included in any of these kits, there are a lot of them listed on amazon, some for as little as half of the price of this one. And remember that you can save a lot of shipping cost by buying kits without bottles. Use your own collected bottles."
1.0,Rotten fruit arrived two weeks after placing order.,"My order was placed on June 1st and it arrived at my home on June 14th, with rotten fruit."
5.0,My Longhaired Tuxedo Loves 'um,My long-haired tuxedo kitty thinks these are the best! She gets a couple just before bedtime and will streak from anywhere in the house to get them when I call.
1.0,Deceptive Listing,"Usually a box of 5 bars is $5 to $6.  So a 4-pack at $22.16 seemed to be right.  Well I just paid $22.16 for 4 bars.  If I could leave no stars, I would."
5.0,LOTS OF VITAMIN B AND I LIKE THE TASTE,I'm on Dr. Peter D'Adamo's Genotype Diet.  Marmite yeast extract is a Superfood for my genotype.  I like to mix it with crushed garlic (another Superfood for my genotype) and eat it on crackers.  Sometimes I even eat it without crackers.
5.0,Best Crab Boil Around!,Leave it to Amazon to have the things we love but can't find at local stores.  Rex Crab Boil is so much better than the Z product found in stores.  And my Gulf coast blue crabs won't be too happy that I've found this product again - their lives are now in danger!!
1.0,Expired date is too close,I bought this item for my friend who will come to NY next month (because she likes this flavour very much). I got this item today (May) and the expired date that shown is on June. If I knew it would come with only one month expired date. I definitely won't buy....very disappointed...
5.0,"Exactly what I was looking for: Fast, fantastic Chai!","I was skeptical as to how good an all-in-one Chai Tea for Keurig could be, but my doubts were erased at my first sip!  The spice blend is great, as is the sweetening and the dairy component.  This is the kind of thing I was hoping I could get from my single-serve coffeemaker!  Order some, you will thank yourself every time you brew a cup."
5.0,Talking Remote Meat Thermometer,A must for the busy cook.  Alerts you when attention is needed. No need to keep running outdoors to check on whatever you're cooking.
1.0,Yuck,"If you're looking to buy this item online it's probably because you love it and can't find it anywhere else. So, I won't try to change your mind but let me just say that as a health-conscious, natural food nut, this cereal seemed worth a try, especially since I love the regular special K, but I found it to be tasteless and roughly the texture of chopped particle board.  For someone on a low-carb diet, I'm sure this probably beats some other low carb cereals, but I couldn't tolerate it without an extra 1/2 tsp. sugar in the bowl. I tried giving it to hubby, without telling him I hated it, just to see if I could get rid of the box, but he won't eat it either."
5.0,Delicious,"I really wasn't expecting much from a low sugar cookie, but I am pleasantly surprised. I plan to order these again and again."
1.0,Bad Idea!,Not shipped correctly!  You will pay lots of money for a soggy box of empty bottles.
5.0,Works great!,I highly recommend this for anyone having problems with milk supply. It takes about 2 weeks to start working.
1.0,I Don't Think So,"These don't work! I went to the store, bought one, went home, stretched, and then I ate it. I went outside and started my run. I made it about two miles before I petered out. Marathon? I don't think so."
1.0,anybody else have a reaction?,"We got a very serious reaction to this bread.  Anybody else experience problems?  Any idea what we might be reacting to?  The bread was wonderful, in smell, texture, and taste.  I just skipped the egg + egg whites thing and used three eggs, adjusting the other liquid which was trader Joes rice milk.  I wish we could eat this.  It is so good.  People who are having trouble with the final product might try calibrating their ovens temperature, i.e. find out if your oven thermostat runs hot or cold.  Another trick if you have an old oven is to preheat it to 50 degrees more than required, put in your pan, and immediately turn the oven down to the correct temperature.  Anyway, anyone have any idea why this bread makes us violently ill?"
1.0,Do Not Buy,"As previous reviewers have said, the design of the container leaves a lot to be desired.  The cans keep tipping over.  Why have the can narrow at the bottom and wide at the top.  Should be the other way around.  I won't buy these again.  Campbell's, I hope you read these reviews."
1.0,Just NOT like sugar!,"Sorry, but this has a gritty taste, not sweet & certainly not like sugar in any way. Would NOT use for anything. Was really excited to try it as it has no sugar alcohols, which bother me, but this isn't the answer..."
1.0,Not quite my cup-o-tea,"Felt ripped off...certainly appeared to be larger and of greater quantity than the actual size received. And $11.00 for shipping? Really? It weighs nothing! You know...""buyer beware"""
1.0,Watery,"I wish I had read the reviews.  I do not like at all.  I was not looking for a marinate sauce, I wanted a BBQ sauce to dip my meat in.  Even as a marinate sauce it is way to watery and vinegary.  I bought 2 bottles and I really wasted my money.."
5.0,The BEST refried beans you will ever eat!,"These are fantastic!  Better than even many restaurants.  Having become addicted to these in Texas, I now have them shipped by the box to the east coast because I love them so much."
5.0,Surprise! Cesar Dressing Available!,"Finally, I was able to purchase Good Seasons Cesar Dressing.  The grocery stores here don't carry it anymore!  Imagine my surprise that I was able to buy the dressing through Amazon.  The price is great and free shipping.  Mix with oil and vinegar and you've got the best dressing around!"
1.0,Not Starbucks.,"If your looking for an alternative to Starbucks for your morning coffee, keep on looking! This syrup by Torani makes my coffee undrinkable and if I put less I can't taste a thing."
1.0,AAAAAAAaaaaccccKKKKK!!! PRICE WENT UP OVER 50%!!! When can we subscribe for this great healthy snack?,"A half-pack of this (if I can stop at a half-pack) usually suffices when a craving for SOMEthing to snack on fights the knowledge of blood sugar readings that are borderline for type 2 diabetes. Other reviewers have described it most adequately, with nearly all finding it quite enjoyable, perhaps not TOTALLY virtuous, but much healthier than most snack foods. This is the best price I could find for it, at this writing a dime per pack cheaper [[AS OF JUNE 6 50% MORE!]] than at W**-M***. Amazon does not yet offer it by subscription, which would bring further price improvement and freedom from having to place repeat orders.  UPDATE: THE PRICE WENT UP BY OVER 50%!!! These were $1.50/bag at a ""national discount chain,"" so I can no longer recommend buying them from Amazon.  The store had them in stock when I checked, but another store wanted $2.50 per bag.  If Calbee drives the price up so horribly everywhere, I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AT ALL.  Oh, Amazon, why do you keep doing this to us?  This isn't the first time that your price for a beloved item rose by some huge amount.  Ya know what?  We can buy a bag of frozen microwave-steamable sugar snap pea pods or edamame (soy beans, either shelled or in pods) and be eating them five minutes after the urge packs us.  The bags costs less, contain more pods, and contain no fats or seasonings, so we can control the amount and type of added sinfulness."
1.0,My Cats Will Not Eat the New Formula,"I chose to switch my cats to Felidae after the food they'd been eating for five years was discontinued and I had trouble finding something they liked that was safe for them to eat. Felidae seems to be one of the only brands not involved in the constant pet food recalls. I did start them on the non-senior variety and then moved to this when it was time to more closely watch their weight. They are healthy and shiny with fewer hairballs than they had in the past. UPDATE (June 13, 2012): I just got a new bag of this food. The formula seems to have changed (indicated by a new food shape), and my cats will no longer eat it."
5.0,Celebration herbals-Hibiscus Tea,"This is good tasting tea, no need for sugar....I am drinking one cup per day usually at mid- day for blood pressure...........I am not sure how long it takes to help lower BP but if it helps even a little it's worth drinking especially since its very tasty........"
5.0,Super quick shipping and delicious!,"I originally purchased two containers (6 pounds total) to try this honey for making mead.  Of course I had to taste a little bit before pouring all six pounds into my fermenting tank, and it's delicious. I ended up keeping that bottle open and ordering a third so I had an untainted bottle for my mead, haha. Both orders arrived undamaged and well packaged. The product itself is fantastic, you can really taste the slight citrus notes in the honey, it is darker in color than your run of the mill grocery store bought, nice and thick and gives my mead a very rich, amber color."
1.0,Recipe of Spicy Sesame Linguine seems to have changed for worse & Price gone up by more than 50%,"We have been ordering Spicy Sesame Linguine for the past 2-3 years as this was our favorite pasta! However, we recently realized that the taste of this linguine has lost its sesame flavor completely. The pasta now looks very different in color and texture and from our experience has now become completely tasteless.  Moreover, the price of this pasta has increased from around $13.71 in 2010 (via Subscribe & Save) to $20.30 in July 2011, hence the price has ramped up MORE than 50%!  What a pity the manufacturer of this pasta seem to have changed the recipe for worse. We were so disappointed that we even sent a complaint note on Amazon, who informed us that they have informed our disappointment to Al Dente. We hope that Al dente will make this pasta as delicious as it once used to be. Thank you."
1.0,Nothing like the original,"Yes I had the original Turkish Taffy - No this is nothing like it - The people who are writing the positive reviews are probably shills for the company that bought the brand name.  This is made with artificial flavor, mono and di-glycerides, and egg albumin - it's soft and tastes fake.  Any wax wrapped taffy that you buy in the store (although not the Bonomo style) wil probably be much better quality than this.  Don't waste your time."
1.0,Buy a fly swatter!,Save your money.  I only tried because my originals aren't carried any more.  I'm trying Pro Pest next.  These are AWFUL!
5.0,Jack Links are great,"Excellent value.  These are exactly the same beef sausages that you'll see on the checkout counter at gas stations and party stores.  (for half the price)  If you're a dog lover, like me, compare these to the price of that junk they call ""dog treats."""
1.0,These taste so bland.,"Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad."
5.0,Super tender,"I loved this hearts of palms. I've always been a total fanatic of them, but it is hard for me to find them in USA (an expensive). I tried this ones and the price and quality is awesome. Unbeatable. The palms are smaller than usual, but also more tender than usual probably because they were extracted from young plants (usually fits 6 in a 14oz can and here they were 13 small ones). I also liked that they are organic and protect the forests while you enjoy one of the most delicious food on earth."
5.0,Great value on java,"Green Mountain coffee is very good and this was the best value I've seen anywhere.  I love the smooth flavor and richness of this coffee.   New Customers  When you open an account, you'll gain access to a full range of benefits including: View order history and previously purchased items Store your shipping & billing address for fast and easy checkout To get started, click ""Create an Account"" and enter the information requested on the next page."
5.0,dark and full of aroma,"Community roasts the best coffe.  Everyone in Louisiana can tell you this.  It's too bad that most people out of the gulf south are not aware of how awesome CC's is.  Cafe Special is the best, but French roast is quite good as well.  Deep, dark, rich, and full of aroma, but not acidic and burt like that starbucks garbage.  I highly recommend for those who want to have coffee with taste."
1.0,Coffee grounds are everywhere!,"The seal on top of these K-Cups pops open during brewing, creating a huge mess of coffee grounds.  This was not an isolated incident:  EVERY ONE in the box does this.  I even tried them in a friend's Keurig with the same result.  Beware!"
1.0,Where is the rest of it?,"The description says this is a case of popcorn (24 packages).  For the price charged, it should be!  When it arrived, there was just one package of popcorn included.  Amazon was very prompt with the refund but having to return one package of popcorn to get the refund is silly!"
1.0,The Product is Good... The Price Not So Good...,"My wife loves this product and has enjoyed it for years. The product is the only coffee I will drink as I am not a coffee drinker.  Having said this, the price it is offered at is NOT so good.  We have purchased it for under three dollars a tin and regularly buy it, not on sale, for three twenty-eight a tin as of 12/2010.  I consider the previous reviewer's comments legitimate as I can get a better deal at the local ""Stuff Mart"". It is a deal once it gets below three dollars a tin."
1.0,"Far from ""natural""","This coconut water is completely disgusting. I normally buy brands like O.N.E. and Vita Coco, but it has been hard to find them in stock recently. I've seen Zico, so when it went on sale at a local store I decided to try it. I didn't take the time to check the ingredients because I assumed it was like the other brands, pure coconut water.  First off, this is ""from concentrate"". They defend this on their website, but don't be fooled. It affects taste, quality, and nutrition.  Second, they add ""natural flavors"". There is nothing ""natural"" about a ""natural flavor"". It tastes fake and has a nasty aftertaste.  This is by far the WORST coconut water on the market and I hope they will listen to consumers and actually make it ""natural""."
1.0,"You want it to be great, but it just isn't","I've had many harissas and often have made my own.  While this isn't the worst I've had (that stuff in the yellow tube is), it just doesn't have the robust flavor of a true harissa.  The addition of bell pepper and vinegar make it less versatile and pure if you're looking for the real deal."
5.0,A Great Tast without All the Caffeine,"Using this Green Mountain Coffee ""Half-Caff"" K-Cup greatly simplifies the task of mixing caffeinated with decafe coffee. I was surprised at the rich taste of this coffee. I highly recommend it to those of you who prefer NOT to put so much caffeined into their bodies.  This is a good choice!"
1.0,stevia price,This item is a lot cheaper at the grocery store!!!!  It is about 7 dollars a bag at your local grocery store.
5.0,Really delicious,"This is not only a fabulous tea, but I don't get bored with it. The flavor is interesting and robust enough to keep my attention, but not so intense that it's overwhelming. If you generally like rooibos tea but want it with something extra this is a good choice. They somehow managed to put in the perfect amount of lemon: not so much that it's predominant, but not so little that it's undiscernible."
1.0,ORANGE GREASE IN A CUP,This was so bad I had to find a place to write a review.  It's full of grease and has that preservative acidic flavor to it.... if you can get past the chili powder.  I threw it out and took tums!
5.0,Delicious blend,The peppermint/guayusa blend is delicious. The guayusa is mild and slightly sweet so it blends very well with the peppermint. I love drinking this in the mid-afternoon for a pick-me-up that won't keep me awake at night like coffee does.  I highly recommend it!
5.0,Christmas Kringle,These danish pastries arrived as promised and were fresh and tasty as expected. Ordered on a Saturday but made it out the following Monday and arrived as hoped for a party that following weekend. Was concerned it might not make it in time but they did and were a big hit at the party. Interestingly two other Kringles ordered as gifts at the same time did not ship until the following week. Fortunately they were not intended for the party and the later shipment did not cause any problem.
1.0,Beware . . .. Inedible!,One container of this soup (15 oz) contains 1520mg of Sodium (64% of your daily allowable intake) and it tasted like it. Campbell should be ashamed of themselves. In addition it is in a plastic container and yet has a metal after taste. After a spoon full it went into the garbage.
5.0,my favorite mustard,"I'm so pleased to find an online source for this mustard.  It is not available in my area at all anymore.  I have enjoyed this mustard (the hot) for years.  It used to be ""Durkee's Mister Mustard,"" then ""Frank's Mister Mustard."" I remember it being called a dijon-style hot mustard, probably referring to its coarser grind.  Now is made by a small manufacturer in NJ who probably isn't doing enough to distribute it nationwide.  BUT it a great mustard, unique, hot in a different way than many hot mustards, just the right burn, just the right texture.  Can you tell I really like this mustard?"
1.0,Horrible taste... simply horrible,Whoever green lighted this product should be replaced. It is one of the most unpleasant tasting things that have ever come in contact with my tongue. I spit them out immediately and returned them to the store.
1.0,Items had been expired for 10 months,The bowling pin candy was marked with an expiration date of March 2011. As soon as we handed them out at the birthday party one child noticed the expiration date. By then it was too late to do much about the problem. Another child said he did not like the lollipops. Maybe if they were fresh he might have. The bowling ball candy did not have an expiration date on the wrapper so there was not any way to know how old that was. I noticed one positive review above. I think the lollipops worked out in that instance because the children could not read.
5.0,Delicious Organic Vegetarian Mushroom Soup (Chowder),"We bought 4 boxes of this for my husband's (quite elderly) grandmother. She didn't like it, I suspect because it's got a mild flavour, has no msg and is on the less salty side of things. But we loved it! Rich, creamy, thick with little chunks of mushrooms. Doesn't taste like it was made from a powder! Follow the instructions and cook for maybe even a little longer than package says."
5.0,A Big Hit,Got this for my daughter's Lab Mix puppy. He is about sixty pounds. He loves it when first given it and he returns to it regularly.
1.0,Aged cheddar gives me sinus infection,"Tastes great, addictive but I always get a sore throat and I am coughing up a lot of mucus within 24 hours of eating it. The aged cheddar flavr"
1.0,Ethical Coffee Nespresso capsules,"No wonder they were so cheap.  They don't work very well in my machine because of the ""biodegradable"" packaging.  I wouldn't buy them again."
1.0,Don't be tempted by the price...,"The new price is very attractive. However, it tastes horrible. Maybe if you haven't had the old Zico, or any other of the coconut water brands you might find it acceptable."
5.0,Best Instant Noodles I've had...,"First of all, it tastes great. I've had the Shin Ramyun, Neoguri, and Chapagetti from Nong Shim, and this Kimchi Noodle Ramyun outdoes them all. The spiciness is JUST right, the saltiness is at a good level, the flavor is rich and full, the noodles are firm and have good texture... and best of all, it's easy to make in a microwave. Just throw in a microwave bowl, add water, and microwave for 7 minutes or so (don't take my word for the time... it depends on your microwave). I've lived in Japan most my life (Japan is the paradise of instant noodles... I REALLY know my instant noodles), and ever since I moved to America recently, I've been craving for GOOD instant noodles (not the cheap, crummy stuff in styrofoam cups like Maruchan...). This satisfied my craving. The sodium and oil and whatever are bad for you. Of course. It's instant noodles. Deal with it :D"
5.0,Pumpkin Bread,This pumpkin bread was the most favorite of all the tasty treats sent to my son during his time in a military academy.  All his friends would line up to get in his room on the weeks this bread was sent.  Easy to make and traveled well.
5.0,So Fresh,These are the freshest Good 'n Plenty's I've ever had. I'm addicted to these things. I used to buy them in the theater boxes at the grocery story for about a buck each. These are a lot more affordable. I've done what another reviewer did. Separate a bag into ziplocks so they stay fresher.
1.0,Not for Big Dogs,"Granted I didn't take into account that my dog would chew through the rope, but my Pit had this destroyed in less than 10 mins.  The sides of the bottle are too deep to really dispense without having to tip the bottle, so she got a little frustrated trying to get the treats out.  She ended up bringing the toy to people to get the treat out for her.  Well, she got tired of that and just decided to eat the rope off.  I was really excited to get this toy too, she needs mind games to keep her busy.  This one just doesn't hold up.  Totally not worth the $20 I wasted.  I'm sticking to Kong and West Paw toys from now on.  They are the ONLY brands I have found to hold up and cost less than the new poser brands coming out."
1.0,Vendor is overpriced,At $18.49 for a 24 pack you are paying close to 78 cents per can. THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!  Even the overly priced Petsmart chains have it for less than that. Save your money and skip these people. Current price for any can of Friskies should not exceed 54 cents/can and less than that for a pack or 24+.
5.0,SunMaid Honey Raisen Bran Muffin Mix.....Great muffins.,"These are the best bran muffins I've ever eaten!  When my local grocery store no longer stocked the item, I liked them so well I ordered 12 boxes from Amazon!  To make them even better, I mix in 8 oz of pecan bits. Twelve boxes seems like a lot, but since my niece and her family introduced them to me, we divide the twelve boxes and they go fast!"
5.0,OMG!!!,"I made a pot of coffee this morning, half 8 o'clock and half this.  All I can say is OMG!  This is the best coffee I've ever had at home.  The flavor explodes in your mouth and washes over your palate very smoothly.  I will definitely be trying more of Cameron's coffee products."
1.0,Will not buy this product again,this coffee is by far sub-standard for the Keurig machine. It's just instant coffee in a pod. I will never buy this again.
5.0,"Mmmmm, Mmmmmmm GOOD!!","I am a peanut butter lover!  Never tried Nutella, but this stuff is amazingly delicious!  I was a little weary about the ""grittiness"" from other reviews but went ahead & ordered the 3 pack.  Sure glad i did! I don't think it's gritty and the sweetness is just right.  Will definitely buy again when these 3 jars are empty."
5.0,Fantastic flowers,"I bought these for my mother's birthday, and she was extremely happy with them (and my mother is brutally honest).  She said they were ""beautiful"" for well over two weeks.  She also said they were a very large bouquet and arranged very nicely.  I will definitely buy from Falcon Farms again."
1.0,SHORTAGE,"BE AWARE THAT THE P-NUTTLES PACKS HAVE ONLY 2 OUNCES IN THEM NOT 3 OUNCES AS ADVERTISED.  AS MUCH AS I LOVE THE PRODUCT, I WILL NOT BE ORDERING IT AGAIN.  I DID EMAIL AMAZON ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  NEVER GOT A REPLY."
5.0,Tastes Great!,This is a great alternative to eating cereals that contain wheat.  Amaranth is one of the few grains that has not been tainted by being genetically modified!  Eat this delicious cereal with the confidence that you are putting something wholesome in your body!
5.0,"Wonderful, healthy snack!!!","Simple, yet super tasty, it's good as is or with a flavorful spread. It's quite great with some raw almond butter and fruit juice-sweetened fruit spread!"
5.0,I might have to buy a case,"I bought this on Amazon a while back on a whim and I'm loving it.  Personally, I wouldn't consider it so much of a hot sauce, to me hot sauce is an ingredient whereas I LOVE this on my burgers.  I'll definitely be buying a couple bottles of this for the grilling season this year."
1.0,brojken pail,"i have a subscription for re-order for this product. i received on of the two pails and it was leaking pink juice out of the package. i refused one of the two boxes and have not had a replacement sent. there is no available action for this problem and it also says non returnable, what am i to do?"
5.0,Great tea!,"I must admit that I am not typically one who drinks tea, but am always looking for ways to increase my health.  This tea is delicious.  I typically have trouble drinking green tea, yet find myself having two to three cups of this every night.  The minty aftertaste really seals the deal for me.  I don't know if this actually relaxes me or not, but the taste alone is worth it."
5.0,Great Value.,The 5# of pine nuts I ordered are wonderful.  Used them right away for homemade pesto.  I use pine nuts a lot in my cooking but they're so expensive in the grocery store.  The value on these 5# is amazing.  I figure I saved at least $60.  The quality is great.
1.0,misreputation,I RECEIVED A PACKAGE.  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN IT BUT OPENED IT AND THERE WERE STARBUCKS VIA PACKETS ALL TOSSED IN.  I SORTED THEM AND REPACKED AS IT WAS FOR A GIFT.  IN THE AD IT LOOKS LIKE THE PACKETS COME OUT OF A BAGN OR BOX.  IF SO PLEASE SEND ONE.  THEY ARE A MESS ALL OVER THE DRAWER. THIS IS NOT TOO LATE FOR YOU TO FIX.  IF YOU DO I WILL WRITE YOU A NEW REVIEW.  I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS AS A GIFT.DISAPPOINTED IN STARBUCKS.
1.0,Cheap but you get what you pay for,"Product inexpensive but low quality.  Little black bugs were in the first bag I opened.  You couldn't tell just looking at the package, only after soaking in a white bowl did I see the tiny tiny black tick-like bugs.  If you could get past the gross factor, they are easy to wash off.  However, even if that was a fluke, the noodles are inferior and are not ""glassy"" like I expected.  They must be mixing something else into them as the consistency is a mixture between glass noodles and rice noodles.  Amazon, please offer some decent noodles via the prime program.  The other good noodles come with $7 shipping charge, which is not affordable.  I guess I will be buying in a conventional store."
1.0,Disgusting!,Oh man!  This stuff is so gross!  I made it for dinner tonight as a part of my continuing effort to find the perfect chili.  This one lands DEAD LAST on my list!  I followed the instructions to the letter.  It had the nastiest flavor (or lack thereof).  My husband actually spit it back out.  We ended up dumping it and eating out.  Ick.  DO.  NOT.  BUY.  THIS.     :o(
5.0,Excellent service,"Excellent service! I sent them an email and got a quick response, very nice:) The item was a gift for my family and they were very pleased."
5.0,"Great cookies, thank you Betty Crocker","These cookies are good, chewy and have great flavor.  Next time I may try baking a slightly shorter time than recommended, as mine were a little too brown around the edges but otherwise, perfect.  My son (who does not have celiac) thought that they were fantastic and was disappointed the day after I made them when I had finished them off!  I just couldn't stop after missing good, fresh from the over cookies for years.  I noticed a few negative reviews here from people who have not tried the products!  Shockingly, there is even one from someone plugging her own gluten free bakery and then hypocritically criticizing others for getting on the ""gluten free bandwagon"" since there are ""bucks to be made""! Well, it turns out that perhaps the larger manufacturer has the research money and testing facilities to get the taste RIGHT.  This mix (along with the yellow cake mix) is better than nearly all of the specialty mixes I have tried.  It is sad how many pans of cakes, brownies, blondies and cookies I have tossed in the garbage because they were inedible.  Thank you Betty Crocker (General Mills) for making a very high-quality gluten free mix available in my regular grocery store!"
5.0,IZZE made a hit with my entire family with this flavor!,"We have been drinking various forms of flavored carbonated natural drinks for many years. From Knudsens to After the Fall, to Flavored Vitamin Waters without the carbonation, my family has tried all kinds of different flavors and types of carbonated and non-carbonated drinks with no refined sugars added.  IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is made of 70% fruit juice with added vitamins such as B6, Beta Carotene, Niacinimide, and vitamin C.  I am not sure what the *natural flavors* added are, as this is often a hiding place for ingredients with some companies that do not want you to know little things they sneak in.  Flavorwise, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is very good.  It is made from concentrate so there is not the fresh flavor that you would get from fresh juice, but I find that this juice only has a tiny bit of bitter edge to it- nothing like most orange flavored juice beverages we have had.  What impresses us about this is that it is not overly syrupy like some juices are.  It takes very light, yet filling.  Another feature of this drink is that the bubbles are not heavy and the carbonation is not overly strong.  Sometimes drinks have so much carbonation in them that they are annoying.  This one has light to medium carbonation in it.  One additional thing I like about this is that the cans are relatively small (8.4oz/248ml).  I have never liked the huge can sizes because I feel that you should only drink small amounts of cooked juice products at a time anyway.  There are 24 in the case, which is a good number.  We drank this warm without ice, but chilled it is also delicious.  It tends to go down a bit easier when it is chilled.  With ice, it is an even lighter drink and bit more refreshing as the ice dilutes it leaving just a hint of orange flavor.  All in all, IZZE Sparkling Clemintine Juice is a hit in our house.  Great flavor, just enough in a can for a snack, and all without added refined sugars or caffeine! My daughter keeps saying- ""Mom, I just LOVE this stuff."""
1.0,"So far, so bad...!","Just like the previous reviewer, the first thing I scanned wjth this new app was the (in my case, 18 ounce) box of Rice Krispies in front of me on the breakfast table. And, just like the previous reviewer's, the results I received were inaccurate: ""Community 12-pack"" (at a much higher price than we'd paid). I'll update my review once I've scanned and checked a few more products, but so far, I'm not as ""wowed"" as I have been with previous buys from these guys. ...P. S. - After writing all of the above, but before hitting the 2nd round of ""Publish Review"" buttons, I discovered that the result info had changed! Now, it's telling me that my 18 ounce box is only a 4-pack of boxes, instead of either the 12-pack it had originally said, or the individual package it actually is! (V-e-r-r-r-y interesting...)"
1.0,Terrible,There are only two good things that I can say about this crap. 1) it has a nice yellow color. 2) It smells kind of like the chicken packet you get with ramen noodles.  Everything else about it is terrible. Yeast Extract and corn syrup solids tastes as awful as it sounds.
1.0,Bad Beans!,"Life is too short to drink bad coffee and these beans make bad coffee.  I have a Compak commercial grinder, a Pasquini Livia 90 espresso machine and the experience to use them.  The beans are dry, the flavor is sour and thin.  These are the worst beans I have ever tried and we have thrown them out.  A waste of money."
1.0,Ugh,"After being in Japan and having fresh green tea, this stuf taste like someone's old shoe. What a let down.  I tried to get used to it, but I give up. It stinks and tastes bad."
5.0,Good Stuff,"I had a small bottle of decorticated cardamom that lasted for years as I only used a small amount every now and then. But then I used it all up and got this bottle. Way more seed amount and for less cost! I use it primarily in my coffee...grind up a pinch of cardamom with the coffee beans and you get this wonderful flavor and aroma in your coffee. With this large amount, I can now try it with other foods."
5.0,"FABULOUS DOGS, the BEST I ever tasted!!!!","Although I am a confirmed carnivore, and love all things meat, if I ever do decide to quit and become a strict full time vegetarian, these would become a staple. They can be now anyway, thanks to Amazon as they are very difficult to find. Once you taste these you will just be amazed at how fantastic they are, one taste and you will be hooked, they are simply great. You can have them in casseroles, on a bun with onions, pickles and relish or just have them all by themselves, they are unbelievably delicious and this is an excellent deal because they are very filling (without the cholesterol)and at 20 oz, one can will last quite a while, and 12 cans will def last a loooong time no matter how often you have them. I love them with any kind of beans, chili, BBQ, baked beans, kidney beans, or green beans. Have one frank and you will fall in love. Enjoy!"
5.0,Everything you could want in a tea,"This tea tastes great, is organic and decaffeinated. It's the perfect combo for me. I don't normally like decaf tea, as it tastes diluted in comparison to caffeinated, but while preggo and nursing, only decaf is acceptable and this tea still manages to have a full, dark taste to it."
1.0,They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff. We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time. Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same..."
5.0,Bought by mistake,"Thia was a great mistake, I thought it was the powder but its the paste, I mainate bonless chicken breast in soy sauce a little sugar and rice wine vinager.  Then put this rub on(sparcely) and do on a gril pan about 7 min. per side and boy is this great."
5.0,Outstanding Organic Coffee,"We have been buying beans from Larry's for several years now. Living in Raliegh we found Larry's local coffee shop. Now that we live in Florida I still order all my beans from Larry!  Coffee is like wine; Everyone has different tastes so don't let any negative reviews prevent you from trying the best coffee (EXCEPT FOR KONA while in Hawaii) we have found. It's all organic, fair trade coffee with lots of different roasts and blends... Our favorite stand by is Cowboy Blend and Frankie Blend (use to be Frank Sumatra). Recently we tried Mountain Sumatra and it was outstanding.  If you want great roasted coffee from a great person that is pure organic fair trade than Larry is your man.  (BTW- I don't not work for Larry) I was just prompted to write this review since we really love his coffee)"
1.0,Tasted absolutely horrible to me...,"Taste is of course a very individual thing, but I ordered these assuming it'd be just like Kikoman teriyaki sauce, but instead it was just horrible. The taste was just off, and I ended up pouring them down the drain."
5.0,Excellent Peach Tea,"I really like this Lipton Diet Peach Tea, its one of the best Diet Peach Iced Tea on the market right now (Crystal Light and Arizona branded dry mixes are also good).  One thing I noticed though with the Diet Lipton, is when stirring / adding water, it froths up alot.  Not sure which ingredient in the drink mix makes it do this, but kinda makes me wonder what is really in there.  I haven't seen any of the other Lipton drink mixes do this, but this is still an excellent product."
5.0,Excellent Coffee AND Excellent Supplier,I cannot find this coffee in any of my local grocery stores anymore.  Love the flavor.  Decided to try what is becoming more and more common:  Buy from the NET!  Got coffee today.  Fast shipment.  Great packaging.  Perfect product.  Highly recommend this seller!  Thanks so much!
1.0,Not the same old product,"I purchased this product in 2011 and it was just what I ordered -pure dates and delicious.  I ordered again last month and got an adulterated product with sugar and water added to date juice.  Don't purchase unless you can be assured that you are getting the unadulterated product.  The sugar water is a throwaway.   Alwadi Al Akhdar Date Molasses, 24.75-Ounce plastic jar (Pack of 3) "
1.0,Not very good...,"Jack Link's turkey jerky has not been available for a while, so I tried this.  It tastes like jerked worcestershire sauce. There isn't much I can add. I'll not buy it again."
5.0,SHE RAN OFF WITH IT!!!,"I really can't say too much here....My dog licked, sniffed,  &nibbled on her new toy then snatched it and ran off like a horse at a race track!!  She's been gone for almost 30 minutes and I can still hear her knawing and grunting like a little piggy...hee hee...."
1.0,"This crap made my puppy sick, don't buy!!!!","I recently purchased this food for my 5 month old black lab mix. When I first adopted him several months ago, I started him on Wellness puppy food. The two issues I had with the Wellness was that, you could only buy it from Petco and of course the price, I was paying $51 for a 30 pound bag. I felt that I could do better. So, I did some research and it seemed that the beneful was the way to go, I bought a bag of the beneful and fed it to my puppy, well, within a few days he was crapping all over the house. Being concerned for his health, but also getting tired of picking up puppy poop, I contacted my local pecto for help and spoke to the trainer, she urged me to immediately stop feeding the puppy the beneful and go back to the Wellness dog food. She even called the beneful ""The Worst Dog food out there"". So I took her advice and immediately saw results in my puppy, he was back to being his healthy, happy, and playful self. I have learned a lesson, not to cut corners on dog food. If buying more expensive food is going to mean a happy puppy, I will spend the money.  Update: 1\20\2011  I read other review on similar beneful products, other people seemed to have similar problems. Many complained about their dogs losing fur, getting rashes, and problems with ""gas"". It appears that this product uses a dye to color the bits of food, I remember when my puppy was sick, I noticed his stool was a red color, I was first scared that it was blood, but apparently it was the dye, and Im guessing he was allergic to the food. Definately BE AWARE of this product!!!!"
5.0,These taste like lemon juice,This is good - It tastes like real lemon juice. I go through these pretty quickly by putting lemon juice in every glass of water that I drink.
1.0,The shipping cost is a joke.,"I'm on a low sodium diet and use this product regularly.  Think it is very good.  Try their salsa.  Couple of jars of this & a couple of jars of another pasta suace, spices, seasonings, etc.  However, the $44.00+ shipping cost is a major rip-off.  Try one of two or three sites on Google.  You will save $20.00 to $30.00 a case."
1.0,Horrible smell and taste (yes I tried it too),There was a horrible smell to the formula that only intensified when mixed as directed. My son refused to get anywhere near this formula. I thought he was over reacting so I tried to taste it and nearly lost my lunch! Seemed like a great product until we recieved it. Save your money any find something else. Got this product because it was labeled gluten free. For other celiacs out there... enfamil is totally gluten free as well and my son was happy to drink it.
1.0,"Its like mixing paint with your coffee, 1 star, I hate it.","I purchased this at my local store in a quart bottle. This flavor is bad... real bad. I felt like someone mixed paint in my coffee. Something is really off in the flavor, can you call paint a flavor? Because that is what this taste like, and sorta smells like. It has a plastic, weird, chemical taste, not good. I emailed the company, do the same if you bought it and do not like it, they will send you a coupon for FREE creamer. Just trust the reviewers here, don't get this flavor, someone screwed up at I.D. Someone needs to get fired for this or made a janitor. Try Almond Joy, I have been using that for months, it taste the best."
1.0,truly nasty,"This is unlike any chai I've smelled or tasted.  The the cassia oil and maple oil totally overwhelm the clove, orange peel, cardamom and cinnamon (the bag does not list orange peel, cassia oil or maple oil as ingredients, but Amazon's website does).  I can't even be in the same room as the closed bag of tea without getting a headache and feeling like retching.  Had to get it out of the house."
5.0,Cost Saver. Dog loves them.,"We have been using Pill Pockets for about 5 years, for Cocker Spaniel that must take seizure medication.  He has never refused to take it.  It is a little treat I always put on top of his food, and even if he doesn't eat his food for some reason, he always eats the Pill Pocket.  Also, I have paid $11-13 EACH bag for all those years at a popular pet store.  To pay $20 for FOUR bags (same weight, same product), is like a huge sale for me.  Very happy with purchase and deal!"
1.0,Disappointing tea purchase,Complete bag of very small tea leaf pieces that normally fall to the bottom of the larger leaf pieces and end up in the bottom of a container of tea.
1.0,No peppermint flavor,"I wanted something to put in my hot chocolate to make it pepperminty and most candies seem to have lost much peppermint flavor. I saw this and read that they are available at Walgreens, so I went over and picked up a bucket. They are light, fluffy, airy, sugary, but not pepperminty. Great texture, no flavor. I put one in my hot chocolate and there wasn't even a hint of mint. Disappointed. Sadly the Bob's brand is worse. They're hard and don't have any of that light airy texture they are supposed to have. I'm going to order some from Williams Sonoma. They get great reviews."
1.0,Safer moth control is no good,I have returened the item because it didn't catch any Moth Fly in 15 days while another brand I got on the same purchase was filled with stuck Moth Flies. (SpringStart BioCare ) is the best. it keep catching more and more Moth every day.
1.0,My two cats just looked and walked away,"Sorry, but all my hopes just flew away -- the cats were not at all crazy for it - as a matter of fact took one whif and walked away.  Not at all like what little gravy is in the canned cat food they usually get and lick every drop up."
1.0,not what it seems,"I ordered this set based on the information that it would fit my Epson NX115 printer and the cartridges are too big. When I called KopyKake, I was told that I was sent the wrong thing. These are used for a printer that is discontinued. Be careful when buying this product"
5.0,Best Curry Yet,"Not only is the price great, but the product tastes awesome on chicken!!  Not to mention the health benefits.  I hope it stays around long enough for me to order when I'm out, which will be awhile thanks to the size."
1.0,A card would be better,"I was a bit embarrassed when I visited my sick friend (65 yrs old) and saw this product I'd shipped.  It was a bunch of junk, basically.  I should have read the contents more closely -- a nice plant would have been better and probably cheaper."
5.0,Yummy - best salt ever,"With lots of minerals, this salt it actually works well with the body and taste amazing. The plastic bag was strong and the salt was in perfect condition. For over 10 years, Himalayan salt is the only salt we use! This packaging and quality met my expectations and I will order again."
5.0,They really taste like key lime pie:),I purchased these candies as I was having a Key West themed party. They are awesome and really taste like key lime:)
1.0,Not good!,"I was really looking forward to this cacao powder and really wanted to like it, but it is REALLY not good.  It tastes very mild and the only taste I can really get out of it is the bitter taste.  It doesn't have the rich taste I am use to .. just bland and bitter."
5.0,No kitchen should be without this.,"Maggi is the king of the cubed bouillon market, its better than Herb Ox (which is owned by Hormel and if you only knew what they are doing to the food supply!) and makes everything from chili, soups, sauces, gravy, and even Beef Au Jus taste better.  This has a rich stock taste, its bolder than the competition and much more flavorful than regular beef broth. If you can find it locally, this is the one to buy. And whatever you do, don't resort to using Wyler's, that stuff tastes like shoe leather."
1.0,blech,"This tasted old and dry - I found it to taste stale, like old, instant coffee. It was a disappointment because I got this machine for my son to take to college, and had hoped the coffees would taste good.  I am still hopeful that other manufacturers will start to make capsules for this machine. But, currently, this is probably the strongest flavor available, and is just not very flavorful."
1.0,Expired Dog Bones,"Amazon.com had the nerve to send me expired dog bones. I do not believe this was not the manufacturer's fault (Sergeant's). In my opinion, this was the intentional wrongdoing of Amazon.com. The packages of bones said ""BEST IF USED BY SEPT 2011 (mind you, it is almost June 2012 now). Then they placed a sticker (that you can peel off) over the Expiration Date of SEPT 2011 that read ""MARCH 2012,"" which would still be considered 3 months expired!  How illegal and sneaky is that? To boot, the dog bones were covered in chicken...not something you mess with regarding the possibility of spoiling. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON.COM  As far as I am concerned, you should not be allowed to be in business for doing something so unethical and potentially dangerous to my dog's well-being. These bones were incredibly expensive to boot, and now I have to deal with returning them to Amazon, making sure they credit my credit card, and also deal with a third party seller for one of my dog bone order returns."
1.0,God Awful,"I just got this drink at the retail store I work at. This drink doesn't even deserve 1 star. I can honestly say this is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my entire life. It was so bad, I kept it to let my friends taste and share my worst drink experience ever. After tasting this, I immediately went online to see all of the hilariously bad reviews. It's labeled a Thirst Quencher. It's more like a gateway drink because it makes you want to immediately drink something else to get the taste out of your mouth. The #1 ingredient should say vomit because that is what you are highly inclined to do. This is worse than cancer."
5.0,Quite Good Chili. Somewhat Zesty.,"My nearby grocery store carries a lot of gourmet and health-related items and I like to try them. One I picked up recently was Amy's Organic Chili. I bought both the regular and the spicy varieties and I'm reviewing the spicy one here. It's quite good for a canned chili. I'd say it's at least as good as any other canned brand. Plus it's fairly low in fat and seems to lack that oily topping I associate with canned chili. I't's a little higher in sodium than I'd like, but not by much. The taste is quite good. It's somewhat zesty but I'd rate the spicyness as mild. The meat is ground and occurs as tittle interspersed grains rather than larger chunks. Of course, it's organic. I've always liked chili and this is a good one that I can keep stashed in my pantry.  Gsry Peterson"
5.0,More convenient but not as cost effective,"I was pleased to discover this product again after Sam's Club quit selling it.  However, the pricing per unit at Amazon.com is almost as high as in stores when the smaller individual packages go on sale.  The previous price at Sam's Club was about $6.48-$6.75 per box.  On line it runs about $10 per box or about .55 per tub.  The box is more convenient but not necessarily less expensive."
5.0,Great,I have been searching for an acceptable alternative to the Penrose sausages for years and have eaten many mediocre and gross sausages. This is the best Penrose substitute that I have found.
5.0,Crap!,"Yet another form of the ""generic"" Rogan Josh spice! you end up with something you would find at a Punjabi restaurant which is supposed to pass for Rogan Josh! NOT the real thing...crap! Try to find the authentic deggi Mirch if you want the real thing..."
5.0,Mio,Tastes pretty good. Very useful on vacations to flavor your water and save money on drinks. Just make sure to shake-up/stir a lot of else there is a bad after taste. I don't really have a favorite flavor but the purple one appeals to me a little more. Now I want to try the sweet tea flavor next.
5.0,Perfect Substitute,These are as good as Planter's Cheese Balls which were discontinued a few years back. My husband was recently looking for the original in the store and purchased a store brand of cheese balls which were extremely salty. The container keeps them nice and crisp even in the humidity of the Pacific NW.
1.0,Tiny Bottle,"I don't care how good this product is, it is not with the price. I was shocked to see how small the bottle was for almost 11.00."
5.0,It's OK to drink the water in the can,"It's OK to drink the water in these Del Monte French Style Green Beans cans because no salt has been added and lead has been banned from the canning process in the U.S.  In fact, according to the ""Nutrition Facts and Analysis"" website, the fluid in the can contains at least 20% of the nutritional value (vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants) of the entire can of green beans.  So drink the fluid inside the can as if it were a very healthy tea.  All beans are moderately high in antioxidants (and calories).  French Style Green Beans are slightly above average among beans in antioxidants and substantially below average among beans in calories.  Among beans, only soybeans, which are high in calories, are healthier for us to eat than these low-calorie green beans.  Eating 6 cans of green beans equals the same number of calories as eating 1 can of soybeans.  Like most modern varieties of green beans, there is no string in these French Style Green Beans.  When compared against Libby's French Style Green Beans (no salt added), Del Monte (this product) was just slightly firmer and just slightly better tasting inside the can.  But Libby's product is priced slightly lower than Del Monte's.  According to whfoods.com, green beans are moderately high in the carotenoids, beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin and in the polyphenols/bioflavonoids miquelianin, quercetin, kaempferol, catechins, epicatechins, and procyanidins and in the absorbable, bone-friendly mineral, silicon."
5.0,Delicious,"This is the best vegie mix I have ever bought. It adds so much flavor to my soups. Every item I bought from this seller has been very fresh. I just bought 6 more jars of the vegie mix to keep on hand. I even boil it with spaghetti, My son loves it that way. I am going to give a few away to friends, so they can share in my findings."
1.0,"Rating for Amazon price, not the coffee",This is our favorite Starbucks flavor.  So the flavor gets 5 stars but the Amazon price of over $27 for 36 ounces is terrible.  BJs sells a whole bean bag (40 ounces) for $21.29.
1.0,Partially Hydroginated crap,Threw the entire box away.  I thought I was buying Cappichino grade coffee not realizing it was a pre-mixed crappichino. Not only is it premixed but the main ingredients couldn't be more fake and gross. It's a k-cup full of preservatives......YUM.
1.0,Rip off,"I bought this product and when I got home and opened the package I was in for a surprise. Not only was the product no where near as good as I remembered it to be, but it had a 3"" by 4"" label smack dab in the middle of the front. When I opened it, yup, no candy underneath the label. Talk about 'false advertising'. Will never buy these again just on principle. This company evidently doesn't care about a loyal following. Fool me once..."
5.0,Great Salsa!,"Great salsa! I prefer the Red Salsa to the Chipotle. I have bought whole cases to bring back with me from Houston. I wish it was cheaper, but it has become something to enjoy now and then. I've brought it to parties and most people think it's great. Some of the bad reviews lower on the page show that many people are unaccustomed to actual salsa that has more of an ethnic flavor. If you prefer your salsa to be made of something more than just tomatoes and corn syrup, check this out."
5.0,Really Good Coffee!,"I love great coffee and I have tried many brands offered here on Amazon. This Lost Art Blend is perfect with the added benefit of being low acid. I would call this a full bodied medium roast, it is very smooth with a slightly sweet finish. Stands up well to cream and sugar too. The beans are not oily at all, they actually look dry like a decaf. I grind the beans about 25 seconds in my Krups grinder for a cone drip brew. I plan to buy a bigger bag while its on sale this month. No stomach or bladder irritation anymore either!"
1.0,Not good,"I was buying quinoa from a different supplier and when their prices went up I switched to buying from amazon this ancient harvest brand. Bad mistake. My daughter started to get this rash around her mouth like she had eaten something with wheat in it. She had the rash for months and would complain about her stomache hurting. Everyone else in my family said it made their belly hurt, even the ones who arent gluten free and yes the bitter taste is bad. This quinoa hasnt been rinsed. the exp date is still good but I will be throwing out the rest of it and going back to my old brand!"
1.0,horrible product,Please make sure to buy a small box first .... make sure you like it befor buying it.  I think it's terrible!
1.0,THE CREEPIEST AFTERNOON  OF MY LIFE...,"Admittedly, I had a fever.  And I must say I am a devotee of the Corn Flake (though I only eat Trader Joe's Brand--Kellogg's flakes, though tasty, have too much crap in them).  But Cereal City--the true target of this review--and a place that now has GREAT bearing on my thoughts about this product--was CREEPY.  From the bald lady with two teeth who took our ticket and felt that this gave her liscense to engage us in a too-long conversation, to the Pennywise-looking clown that reeked of smoke--our first two minutes set the tone.  Throw in a weird new-agey film with floating balls of light that became speaking versions of dead historic figures who never got along in life and pick up their arguments right where they left off on the screen.  Add to that a poorly-lit animatronic Snap, Crackle, and Pop who end up either looking like they are rising from the grave or falling in worship at the feet of Tony the Tiger (depending on whether they are coming up or going back down).  Our (hopefully) unique experience involved not being able to find a lady crucial to our scavanger hunt for 45 minutes (did she go in back and take a nap?) I want a shirt that says ""I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup.""  Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length. But I won't.  The main point is that I get the sense that Kellogg's, as a company, is just as creepy as its tourist trap. Avoid both."
1.0,Cardboard!,"How can something that looks this delicious fail to have any taste? There's dark chocolate but almost no discernible sweetness! SO disappointed. For the 190 calories and plenty of protein AND great taste, I would recommend  Zone Perfect Sweet and Salty Cashew Pretzel -- 1.58 oz Each / Pack of 12 -- out of this world!  Won't be buying the Nature Valley ones again!"
5.0,absolutely the best!,"this is the best tasting bear claws i have ever eaten, a few were a little melted,so i called customer service & they took care of it immediately, i have never had a company take care of a problem as fast & professionally as they did, i will definitely be doing more business with them in the future!"
1.0,not Petit Beurre,"I ordered these biscuits in a naive assumptions, that they will be similar to the french original. No way - I donated them to the charity."
1.0,Useless,"Picked up a bag of this on recommendation from the lady at our neighborhood pet store.  This litter consists of large sawdust pellets that are too big to fall through the scooper, and as soon as they get wet, they disintegrate into damp sawdust that smells rather piny and neutral, but is impossible to scoop because it doesn't clump whatsoever. This is the opposite of how I want my litter to act. The dirty stuff falls through the scoop, while the clean stuff gets stuck in it?  I don't think my cats like the damp sawdust either. They ended up peeing on their bed even though this litter was ""clean""."
1.0,False Advertisement,"I am so disappointed - this item was listed as pods for Keurig, instead I received round coffee bags! I don't know how I can trust to order from Amazon again. How do you differentiate the items!  Very very unhappy!"
5.0,Delicious!!!!,I am a tea drinker and a chocolate lover.  This tea is decaf and has a very chocolatey taste.  It satisfied my craving for chocolate without any calories.  I love it and so does the rest of my family.
1.0,Cheap yet pricy,"The cheapness of the soda is very good deal but the Shipping charges rounded 10 dollars. I didnt see it when i bought, perhaps a greater or a warning at all would help"
5.0,Good Energy with No Jitters for me,"Despite it's juvenile sounding name, this isn't a child's energy drink that's for sure. Each tube packs about 42,000% the recommended daily dose of Vitamin B12. The high from this is extremely stable and hasn't yet given me the jitters.  Everyone reacts differently though so to guarantee 100% that you will not get the jitters would be a lie.  When I take it, I feel very awake, alert, and clear headed. I use it before a workout and several of the ingredients make it perfect for the gym. The let down is probably the smoothest you'll find among energy drinks. And if you feel a cold coming on, downing one of these may help tremendously.  The name comes from the interaction the mix has with water. You pour one vile into a 16-20 oz bottle of water and the stuff fizzes like crazy! If you don't get the lid on fast enough, you'll quickly find there will be a mess! I've found using a wide mouthed nalgene bottle is the best way to prevent these types of accidents.  In addition to the massive amounts of Vitamin B12, it has a good amount of Vitamin C (500mg), Niacin (10mg), Vitamin B6 (2.5mg), Calcium (60mg), Magnesium (100mg), and Potassium (905mg). It has almost every water soluble vitamin meaning that a lot of the excess that your body doesn't utilize, will be flushed through your kidneys. With that being said, drink a lot of liquid with this and don't over use the product (company recommends no more than 3 a day) or the chance of getting kidney stones exists.  It has a 317mg ""proprietary"" blend blend of L-Arginine, L-Taurine, Caffeine from guarana, Alpha-lipoic acid, Grape seed extract, Green tea leaf extract, Ginger root, and Ginseng root. I don't know how much each compound contributes to the 317mg but they do acknowledge that 100mg of it is caffeine (about the same as a cup of coffee).  There are multiple flavors but I'm partial to Grape and Orange Soda. The flavors are very sweet and candy-like but they surprisingly have no sugar. 10 total Calories and only 2g Total Carb.  This is an excellent product and recommend it over any other energy drink."
1.0,Bad. Bad. Bad.,"This is literally the worst salsa I have ever eaten. I bought this thinking it would be spicy. It isn't. It's really bitter and after looking at the ingredients, I can't figure out why.. They all seem pretty natural and there is no sugar at all in the product so maybe that's why? Maybe it's left over burnt flavor from the charred (not hot spicy at all) peppers used in this product. I actually had to add Valentina brand salsa/hot sauce to this to make it slightly passable, and that didn't even help enough. I'll never be buying this salsa ever again. BEWARE: If you're looking for something HOT and SPICY, DON'T buy this. Also, if you have taste buds and like eating things that taste good, also don't buy this."
5.0,Great Ceasers Ghost- These Cakes Are Great,"WOW WOW WOW WOW,WOW,truly great tasting Banana Nut cake. I've been looking for this type of cake for quite awhile,just found it by accident on Amazon,glad I did,I would highly recommend these & I am going to try their Apple pies next,you won't be disappointed."
5.0,Best tea out there,"This tea is incredible quality, taste and price! I have tried teas all over the world and this gives anything out there a run for its money.  Taste is robust without being too tannic. Smooth and crisp taste with a beautiful color.  Buy it!"
1.0,Wild Planet Canned Salmon,"The label on the can says... No liquid or oil added... That's just not true. I poured off 1 3/4 ounces of liquid from one can. That comes out to a price increase of over 40%  per can for the salmon you actually get. The salmon was good but if you are doing a price comparison per can based on the amount of salmon you get, the real price is approximately $6.46 per can or $25.84 per 4 pack. The other 3 cans sound like they are also full of water. If Wild Planet is not going to be truthful about the amount of liquid in the can, what else may be untrue? Is it really a product of the USA, or never previously frozen like the can says? The next can I have, I will weigh the salmon after pouring off the water."
5.0,This is really good stuff!,"I made some blondies with this last night -- I've made this same recipe tons of times with various vanillas purchased from the grocery store, including a few ""premium"" selections.  Last night's batch with the Nielsen-Massey vanilla was great!  Very rich flavor and aroma.  Yum."
5.0,My 2 dogs love them,"It's great to find a healthy alternative to rawhides. My dogs are about 60 lbs, and they love these treats!"
1.0,1 BOX of 10 packs....,Buyer Beware! The wording is confusing - seems as if listing makes it seems like 10 pack - it is 10 packs in the 1 box. These are less than half this price in the stores. Buyer Beware!
1.0,"Wanted to try it, wanted to like it, but didn't","As a fan of The Real Housewives, I decided to try the BLK water that they talk about and promote on the show. I have to say the thought of a BLK water made me a bit apprehensive but I wanted to try it. The bottle itself and design is really nice, packaging great. The color of the water looks almost like a flat coke. There is no smell to it really. However, I am so disappointed to say, the taste is really bad. It has a metallic aftertaste that does not taste good at all. I purchased one bottle for $6.99, this is not cheap water. And, I guess we don't even need Fulvic Acid to survive nor does it really do anything for us (based on opinion from what I have read online,not a Doctor). All in all, overpriced, tastes pretty bad with not good aftertaste that lingers for awhile. I am so sorry, I wanted to like it!"
5.0,The best pancake/waffle mis you can buy!,"Really, this is the best. Don't make the mistake of adding milk as it becomes pretty heavy. I have never bought a mix that I liked and just had to add water, oil and egg. Very easy to make and a great timesaver in the morning when everyone seems to hurry out the door. And it doesn't hurt one bit to support an employee owned business that stands for true quality."
5.0,yellow label loose tea,make this tea with a basket percolator for an perfect tea.great for iced tea or hot. This is the only one we will drink at home now
1.0,Two months until expiration date,"I received my order in April 2010 and was disappointed to see that the expiration date on all three packages of coffee is June 2010.  The same bags of Starbucks at the grocery are usually almost a year out for the expiration date.  I won't be buying coffee online again.  Otherwise, the service and shipping were just fine.  I'm almost always happy with my purchases from Amazon-- this is a rare exception."
1.0,Edible is a questionable term,"I was so excited about these sprinkles for my cupcake decorating needs... that is until i tried a cupcake that i had LIGHTLY dusted with the glitter.  It feels like tiny razors in your mouth and absolutely ruins the texture of your baked goods. Go natural, dump these ""edible"" flakes."
1.0,Disappointing,"I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.  This is what I found:  - In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn. - While Great Northern has a 6-ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers.  (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.)  So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping. - Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped. - Great Northern Popcorn had a ""chewy"" texture to it."
1.0,Poison!  Poison!,"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great ""treat"", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009! Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these ""treats""!"
5.0,Great mapley tasting cookies!,They have an authentic maple taste. These cookies were a great value. Most cookies arrived intact despite the shipping. What more can I say?
1.0,The Company has covered this product in candy sweetness.  Milk had no taste.,The Company has covered this product in candy sweetness.  Milk has no taste.  Better than the other products competing with Milk.
5.0,My special needs cat can eat this and love it without digestive consequences!,"Other than the fact that this pet food periodically seems to become unavailable, I give this five stars. Nala started haavin the runs, and the vet said something, probably an allergy, was causing her entestines to swell. This venison cat food has really solved our problems. She looks healthy again, and both of my cats love it."
1.0,Horrible new taste!,"I fell in love with this flavor - the original recipe.  I did the subscribe and save option to that I'd always have plenty on hand.  I had to cancel it and will not buy this again.  I don't know what they changed in the recipe, it now tastes horrible!  I can't even finish a whole cup.  I have to throw it out after only a few sips.  I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I'll drink taster's choice instant over this.  I'd highly recommend you do not order this flavor.  It's worse than swill."
1.0,Sampler?  I think not,"My pack came with 4 cappucinos, 2 apple ciders, 2 decaf and 10 of the flavors were repeated.  Not a true variety and why would they put cider in a coffee sampler pack? Ummmmmm.  It seemed like the company bought giant cases of each flavor K-cup and then threw them in a bingo ball sorter.  Never know what your going to get.  I will not be buying this again for one."
5.0,Finally Found It!,I can't believe I found this sauce.  My husband has been raving about it since I met him.  He had it when he had travelled to Belieze years ago and just couldn't get enough of it.  I've ordered this and more as part of his anniversary gift.
1.0,really?,"this stuff is candy water - if you like sweet sugary drinks, then why even bother with kombucha? - isn't coke zero more what you're looking for? It's completely clear so there aren't any live cultures I can see, though I'm not sure they can survive in the ingredients listed on the bottle anyway - I know I can't. It's cheaper than GT Dave's variety, but it tastes nasty, all bubbly, minty and sweet at the same time. Like a party in my mouth with a bunch of uninvited guests - seriously, stay away!"
1.0,Worms!,"I purchased two bags of these Wonderful Pistachios, and both of the bags I received were good.  So, I ordered them again.  The second time I ordered them, in each of the two bags I received, were so many either burned or rotted pistochios...about half of each bag had to be thrown away.  The last straw was when I cracked one that looked only mildly burned and discovered to my horror a WORM!  In addition to the worm was a lot of weird-looking, brown matter.  DISGUSTING!!!!  Needless to say, I found them far less than ""wonderful"" and will NOT be buyng them again."
5.0,Yum!,I searched high and low for a good multigrain cereal and found it in Country Choice. We love the texture and how it's not gloppy like oatmeal. It turns out exactly like the picture on the label. Even my 6 year old loves it!
1.0,strange taste,"I purchased this at the grocery store, not Amazon. It has a strange flavor. It is too sweet and not rich or creamy. I will not purchase again."
1.0,bobd,"Dont be fooled.  This is only a 16 oz container, but by the looks of the picture it appears to be a gallon.  With that being said, this stuff has absolutly NO TASTE.  Dont waste your money on this junk.  The best flavor I have been able to find is the stuff from Wabash Family Farms, Butter Flavor Topping in the yellow Gallon size container."
5.0,Taste So Good,"I like Strawberry the best! Tastes to good I eat one every day, can't help it, and sometimes even two. Can be an addictive habbit, good luck!"
5.0,Incredible Deal,"I used to trek 25 miles to a wholesale warehouse to get a 1000 packet economy box of Sweet 'n Low.  It was such a savings over the smaller 100 packet supermarket variety.  I am so delighted to find it is available on Amazon with ""Prime"" shipping for a better price and with no travel, mileage, gasoline or time expenditure.  Now, I always check Amazon first."
5.0,My dogs love it!,"I am so glad Amazon had our brand! After our distributor went out of business, I couldn't find Hi-Tek anywhere! We switched our two Cattle dog mixes to Hi-Tek from Blue Buffalo after it made our 9-year-old gassy. This food is all natural and made in America (even the packaging is made in the USA) and I can get a huge bag of Hi-Tek for $20 less than other natural brands in the pet store with Amazon's free shipping. When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!  I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek! Natural food on a budget."
1.0,Warning: This is not Juicy Fruit.,"I love Juicy Fruit. In fact, it's one of my favorite kinds of gum. However, I recently bought a pack of this ""Juicy Fruit"" in this big, 60-piece pack, and all I can say is that I'm thoroughly disappointed. This gum tastes absolutely nothing like classic Juicy Fruit (which I have had as recently as a few weeks ago, so it's not my memory). I ate a couple pieces and spit it out in about 30 seconds of chewing. It has a very bitter, noxious taste and has a ""minty"" taste in it as well which is not characteristic of regular Juicy Fruit.  Do not buy this. I will not be purchasing these ""big-e"" packs again, but I will be purchasing the sticks in the future."
5.0,Great gift!,Great business gift. My agent was very excited to get such a sweet surprise. I recommend this gift to anyone looking to impress!
1.0,Cardboard Chips,"These taste like cardboard. Hard, bland and the black bean have an off bitter taste. I've had a lot of baked, diet chips and these are the worst!"
5.0,Love this green tea,This is a smooth grenn tea with a touch of cardamon. I let the teabag seep in very hot water for a couple of mins. Incidentally it is way overpriced here on Amazon. I pay less than $2.00 for a pkg of 30. Just google Tapal green cardamon to see various online stores.
1.0,my cat did not like it,"I guess my cat is not into fish but rather chicken and beef, when I opened the bag and put some on the floor, he just sniffed it and looked up at me as if to say ""what is this?"" and walked away no doubt disapointed, now I have no choice but to throw the whole bag away because he won't eat it, next time I'll just stick to Temptations treats, he loves those."
5.0,I can't believe it's not homemade! Thanksgiving Memories!,"Had these from store 3 years ago and can't find anymore, but the memory hasn't faded as we still speak about them. They taste homemade, that is if you have a French pastry chef living at home. I'm so happy I've found them here. Christmas dinner, here we come!"
1.0,Yucky!,"I wanted to make sure my kittens had the best, healthiest food and read many reviews on Felidae and how good it was for kitties.  My cats won't even touch it, and unfortunately I bought two cases of it.  Oh well."
1.0,Very Disappointing,"When I got these nuts I expected what the description said,sea salt and a 'hint' of pepper.Instead I got a salty,hot assault on my taste buds.There is no taste of cashew left.All you get is an overpowering hot,peppery mess.I would never buy these and do not recommend that you buy them either,unless all you want is heat.Then I recommend you stick your tongue in your car's cigarette lighter.The resulting taste is about the same."
5.0,Great service and grains,"First batch was lost in the mail so a second batch was promptly sent.  The amount of grains was small but you do not need a lot!  After several months, the grains are about two tablespoons in size.  I have already given some away to other kefir drinkers here in Brazil."
5.0,Kay's Naturals Protein Chips,I love the spicey taste of these snack chips. They have lots of protein and are quite filling. They are one of the best protein snacks I've found.
1.0,misrepresented,"purchased this product based on the title ""Roll Curls 4in 1LB 24 - 1 pound / 4 inch""  Believed to be getting 24 roll curls per package - this is not what arrived; when package arrived there were 10 rolls in each package.  Will not purchase from this supplier again, as I believe this to be a misrepresentation of the product."
5.0,Contains quinoa,"Little dude really likes this flavor.  Wish they made a bigger squeeze tube--he usually wants a second one after he sucks the first one down.  It seems like these ""pouches"" can be nearly completely emptied (no food stuck at the bottom).  The pouch completely collapses (like a CapriSun) when it is empty."
5.0,The best coffee around....,All of Lavazza's coffees that I've tried are excellent. I use espresso - as you can see by the label - the way I would ordinary coffee in my drip coffee maker. Lavazza espresso yields a strong yet never bitter brew. There non-espresso grinds also are excellent. You absolutely can't go wrong with Lavazza.
1.0,Yuk,"This tomato basil flavor is weird. It does not work at all with tuna. I bought these months ago and I still have several in the pantry. My husband will tolerate them, otherwise I would have tossed them already.... That just gave me an idea. I will give them to the local food pantry."
1.0,Nasty!,"I love Underwood's Chicken Spread so I decided to give this a chance. It tastes like ground up cardboard. The consistency is pasty, like putty. I will not be buying this again."
1.0,$8 shipping for 12 oz...ARE YOU KIDDING ME???,The tea is ok but I won't buy it again....not with the crazy shipping charges.
5.0,Very happy!,I purchased this item even though some of it's reviews were negative. The first meal I made with these wraps were Enchiladas. It tasted great and was very filling!I am happy that I found a healthy alternative!
5.0,"Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Cherry Chocolate, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)","This is absolutely delicious.  Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow.  I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha.  That also cuts the sweetness.  It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!  I get mine through the ""subscription program"" along with several other flavors from Stephen's.  The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed."
1.0,disliked treats,"I have two dogs and one of them didn't like the treats at all.  She refused to eat any of them no matter how small.  My other dog, who will eat anything (and I mean that!)  loves them.  So I won't purchase them anymore since I want something they both like"
1.0,Expensive.,"Go to Walmart.  You can get a 3 pound bag for under $8.00, about $2.67 a pound.  This costs almost $5.00 a pound."
1.0,"Bad, bruised candy","I ordered two boxes of these -- one for myself, one for a thank you gift. After opening my box, I realized that I would be ashamed to give these candies as a gift. I have been to Belgium and have eaten many Belgium chocolates, and these are just poor quality -- overly sweet with little flavor. They arrived bruised from the shipping and looked like they were ten years ago (dried out and marked). Absolutely horrible."
5.0,Can't ask for more,Everything was in the box and all in date. They added a 10% off coupon for their site and I got the package 6 days ahead of time. I'm assuming most of you are familiar with 5 hr energy but if not its works decently. I have always had low energy that even vitamin B & D supplements couldn't help ( I do still take them to keep my levels in a healthy range). I tried coffee but it messes with my stomach plus it takes to long in the morning. So these shots are perfect in the morning before a workout or going to class. They make you aware and focused instead of completely wired ( for me anyway).
1.0,"DO NOT BUY THE ""NEW GREAT TASTE"" Spearmint Altoids","Just tried the ""new great taste""-labeled Spearmint Altoids and they are HORRIBLE.  For some reason, the Oil of Spearmint has been removed and replaced with artificial flavoring.  These don't even taste like spearmint..."
5.0,Timely Tea,It was wonderful to be able to purchase the tea in this quantity which makes it more affordable.  It also arrived incredibly quickly.  No complaints!
5.0,Delicious and light,This is one of the best ! No aftertaste or bitterness. Capriccio is normally my fave but this may have surpassed it! Delicious!!!
1.0,NOT coconut...tastes like pina colada,I purchased several of this company's extracts and ALL of them were horrible. Strong chemical smell and taste. I would not recommend.
1.0,Still no safety seal -- dealbreaker for me,"I have to wonder about the leadership of this company.  There's a review here from 2007 complaining about no safety seal and obviously no one at the company with the power to change that thinks it's a big deal.  I bought this at my local grocery store.  When I got home and opened it without the lid popping, I took it right back to the store and got my money back.  I was going to call the company but there is no phone number on the label.  Get this--it says if you have questions or comments about the product to WRITE to them.  Ok, sure.  Bet they don't get many questions or comments...which apparently is how they like it."
5.0,"Hot, hot, hot!","I bought this for my husband who is into trying out hot sauces. Is latest interest is the ghost chili pepper which he tried at this burger place in San Antonio. When I saw this had ghost chili peppers in it, I was sold! I knew he'd love it. He dabbed maybe one drop of the hot sauce on a chip and he said it was HOT!  He loved it. I like how it comes in a wood crate too. Great gift for hot sauce lovers."
1.0,Way overpriced,One would think that access to the internet would tend to flatten out prices somewhat.  But these folks missed that. You can buy the same item from the manufacturer's store for $7.99  OOOOOPPPs
5.0,health nut eats these as a meal replacement,"Even if these bars did have a lower cal and fat count once, I never used them until after the company changed their formula. I have tried countless raw/alkalizing bars and this is by far the greatest. I eat one for breakfast and one for lunch and my weight has stabilized after loosing 50 pounds. When considering this bar as a meal replacement, I don't see what the big deal is if the fat calories and regular calories and carbohydrates come from healthy, raw, organic foods. There is nothing wrong with healthy fat and plenty of it--especially when trying to loose weight the healthy way. The Green's plus bars that I would recommend staying away from are the peanut butter protein bars which have an unhealthy cholesterol count and the chocolate coated greens bars which just seem counter intuitive to me."
5.0,"Thank YOU, Elastijoint! (Cue studio audience applause)","Don't look for this to work right away.  It was a couple weeks before I really noticed any difference. Definitely gave me a leg-up (no pun intended) when I had knee trouble.  I've tried both flavors and unless your base for comparison is sodas or sugary-sweet drinks, both are far from terrible.  The taste is better than any other supplements I've ever had to choke down.  Excellent product."
5.0,Love them taters!,"We tried these once after finding them in the local grocery store, then could never find them again.  These are some of the best-tasting mashed potatoes that we have tried.  Glad Amazon sells them!  They cost a little more, but are worth it."
1.0,total ripoff...don't buy,I had high hopes for this gadget to make my life easier.  I have not had a good experience at all.  1.  This food chopper is cheaply made and it really does not puree as well as I would like for my daughter.  My cuisinart is much better at pureeing.  2.  I had a friend who forgot to clean the water part and it has excess mold/mildew...  I just think that paying $150 for this food maker is over the top...I am very disappointed
1.0,Product recall issued in Taiwan,"There is a Chinese article from Taiwan (found in yahoo-Hong Kong) that issued a product recall for all Indomie Noodles.  The test result from Taiwanese authorities shows that the product contained excess amount of preservatives. Although damage to human may not be immediate but prolonged consumption could lead to kidney disease.  I, myself, used to love this product but I have reduced the consumption of all Instant Noodles from once a day to once every 3 to 4 months.  Best to stay away from these processed food especially one with a recall.  ([...])"
5.0,Republic of Tea is the best,"I was introduced to the tea from the Republic of Tea by a friend and I've been drinking it ever since. I cannot have caffeine and these caffeine free teas are delicious. I am completely hooked on the Cardamom Cinnamon and will keep buying it. Amazon always has competitive prices and this helps since it is a bit pricey. During our long winter, this is a very soothing, relaxing treat any time of day."
5.0,Great Gift,"I originally purchased this as a gift, but ended up ""ahem"" trying it out for myself. The food in this tower was fantastic and the cherries were the best. This product was as good and fresh as compared to items offered by bigger brand name gift mail order companies. At the time I ordered free shipping was included, which made this an even better deal.  This tower of sweets makes a wonderful gift for a single person, a couple or just for yourself."
1.0,There are two! from concentrate and not from concentrate,"I haven't had a lot of experience with zico, but I have seen lot of reviews saying that they switched to concentrate. With little research, I found that the one in the 11.2 ounce carton thing is not from concentrate. Sure, I can agree based on sheer numbers that this coconut water sucks, but the other one does exist in case some of you still care."
1.0,Blah.,"#1  The shipping is more than the item.  #2  I just received this ""orgeat"".  Orgeat is an almond infused sugar syrup.  The Fee Brother's ""Orgeat"" is corn syrup, artificial flavors and preservatives.  Not surprisingly, it had a bland flavor.  #3  Good cocktails are made from good mixers.  This is not a good mixer."
5.0,Veri Peri ~ Great as a Chicken & Veggie Marinade!,"Absolutely love the lemon & herb VERI PERI sauce.  Marinated a bunch of chicken thighs and sauteed a mixed vegetable medley of zucchini, summer squash, onion, garlic and mushroom to go with it.  Love this sauce!  It's so flavorful.  You can use it as a marinade, as a sauce in your skillet or work, it's even great as a condiment (dip).  Try it...you'll like it!!"
5.0,Great Dog Food,I have used Wellness SFS for some time - I have two cocker spaniels and one with bad allergies.  This is the only food that helps It may be pricey - but I'll pay the price to keep him comfortable and good food means less vet bills !!!
5.0,"Berry, Berry Good","Contrary to popular belief, these are not just for baking. Not only are Oregon Blueberries loaded with antioxidants, they are delicious right out of the can.  I buy them in bulk from Amazon.Com. I add two or three tablespoons over my Total cereal every morning, along with a heaping spoonful of crushed, honey-roasted almonds and some Splenda. Float the heavenly mixture in skim milk or light soy milk. Add in a glass of orange juice and a banana and you're in for a treat.  Eating healthy can be fun.  This comes from one who was raised on a daily breakfast of bacon, saugage, eggs, whole milk, grits or hashbrowns and biscuits all dripping with homemade butter.  Granted, this was wonderful at the time, but it's a miracle that anyone survives past 50 on such a diet.  However, no health food is any good if you sit on your butt all day and do nothing."
1.0,Dry nd not so tasty,"To each his own, but I did not care for his product at all.  I found the end result too dry and I found the taste pretty bad - I have had healthy products that rank far above this.  I can't bring myself to recommend it."
1.0,Great if you like to eat things that taste like cardboard....,"I used to get something similar to these as a kid in the early 90's so I was kinda psyched when I saw these. However, my excitement quickly abated when i tasted one....they have a gritty texture and the cookie portion tastes like...well nothing...maybe what cardboard would taste like if you ate it...and the chocolate center is not at all creamy like I remember, it's more like a chunk of chocolate chalk or something...not pleasing to eat at all...nostalgia aside, I would certainly not eat these again...maybe I got a bad box, but i can't recommend these..."
1.0,Just didn't like it,"Thought I would try Starbucks coffee because I never had it before and wanted to see what all the ""talk"" was about with Starbucks. I just simply did not like it. It was WAY to strong and a little bitter for my taste. I made the mistake of having this right before bed, which no other coffee has bothered me before, this kept me up almost the whole night, so I can't imagine how much caffine is in it. I'm a newbee when it comes to coffee as I just got a Keurig and am trying all different flavor's and blends. Out of all the ones I've tried, I like this one the least. So far, I like Green Mountain the best - all flavors - IMO."
1.0,Terrible,"I love having a cup of Chamomile Tea before bedtime. But Timothy's Keurig version tasted awful. It was weak and flavorless. I tried making it stronger, but it didn't taste much better. Perhaps I got a bad batch."
1.0,TERRIBLE STUFF,"The cubes don't dissolve well in hot water--a lot floats around on top--and what does dissolve has little taste. Save your money and buy a different brand. BTW, I asked for a refund and Amazon deducted a couple of dollars to pay for shipping, which I get ""free"" as a Prime member."
5.0,Lipton Herbal Pyramind Tea,"During the cooler months, I love to drink a good cup of tea. But there's nothing worse than getting everything ready to find that your tea bag broke and your have leaves floating in your tea. So now with the Lipton Pyramid, you won't have that problem anymore. The pyramid itself is made of a mesh material that's very strong so it won't have a problem with breaking. And the tea itself is delicious. The flavor of it was very delicate and relaxing. Overall it's a much better way to brew tea."
1.0,Shelf Life,"Received the package and tried one out immediately. I don't know what the expected shelf life is on a coffe kcup but I think this one expired a long time ago. The coffee had a harsh smell, like when you left the can open and the coffee went stale. The taste was bitter and did not meet my expectations. Cross it off my list!!!!"
5.0,Fantastic!,These olives are delicious! They are not overwhelmingly spicy.  My 8 year old son just ate an entire bag today for a snack.  They are not packed in juice but are moist and flavorful.  The bags are small enough that they are perfect for tossing in a lunch box or bag.  The calories listed for consuming the entire bag is only 100.
1.0,Horrible!,"I love white mochas, but this is horrible. I can't even drink it. I came on to see if others felt the same or if there was actually something wrong with my creamer. I guess I'm not alone in thinking this is horrible. I'm calling international delight tomorrow :/ how does a company let something this bad into stores!?!?"
5.0,"Great coffee, free shipping, great price","We love this coffee. We are not coffee connoisseurs but do enjoy a good cup of Joe. It works wonderfully in our french press and makes a nice, fresh, coffee shop grade cup."
1.0,Terrible,"I ordered this item for a salt grinder that I have. It arrived quickly, however the salt is not even dry. It is soaking wet! That does me absolutely no good at all. Will I buy this product again? Absolutely NOT!!!! I give it a minus star! Celtic Sea Salt, Light Grey, By The Grain & Salt Society, Coarse Ground, 1 lb "
5.0,Best Pepper Ever,This pepper has the best flavor I have found.  It is worth the price.  I use it for all uses but I love it ground up on steak with sea salt.  Yum!
1.0,Ash tray,"I hate to be harsh, but this coffee does taste like what you think an ash tray would taste like.  And, it's not because it's ""dark roast"".  I truly enjoy dark roasted coffee, but this is horrible.  I purchase it because it had more good reviews than bad, however, many of the bad reviews were spot on!  I am very disappointed with the purchase."
1.0,Not the real product we knew as kids,"The american and european (UK, Canada, etc) market products are very different. Heinz messed things up for us americans by replacing genuine sugar and molasses with ""high fructose corn syrup"" which leaves aslippery gumminess on the tongue and a basically slimy aftertaste. The ""other"" (UK, Canada)sauce is clean, sharp with distinct flavor layers and a beautiful, long-lasting aftertaste. Sorry. I order my product from Canada for the same cost, and hope Amazon soon offers the ""foreign"" product."
1.0,Beware of the Size,I ordered this product from Amazon becuase I wanted it delivered to my home.  I have been using this product for a couple of years and my husband and I like it a lot.  When I opened the package it was a small bottle; about half the size of the regular bottle I buy from William Sonoma.  The price at Williams Sonoma is $26.95 for 17.6 oz and through Amazon I paid $25.00 for a little over 8 oz.  The description of the product does not specify the amount.
5.0,Great Apple Snacks - Highly Recommended!,"A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any ""good for you"" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!  These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like ""Astronaut Ice Cream"") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.  Each pack contains -  Fuji Apple: About 1 1/2 Apples per pack 39 Calories 7 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)  These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!  Highly Recommended! We bought  Brothers ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana - 20 Count Bags  and like all three types!  Note: These are made in China  CFH"
1.0,Terrible Tea!,"So to fairly qualify this, let me say I ordered this after reading good reviews on this product beforehand. It got shipped quickly enough and arrive in fine condition, the problem is the tea itself.  I love the K-cups system, but I think it just doesn't work with brewing tea, as tea tends to benefit from steeping, and a 1 minute or so brew left me drinking very non tea tasting hot H2O. I tried adjusting the setting on my machince to give product every chance, but still blech!"
5.0,The Best Candy Ever!,"I love sees candies, and this year I bought these pops for my two best friends and they loved them.   I ordered them the week of Christmas and they arrived just in time for my trip. Thanks so much for the great delivery service...."
1.0,not correctly listed!,"Unfortunately,if you click on K cups on the left side of the screen these come up. They are not! They are are a non returnable item,so it is money wasted!!! I am so disappointed because it was so convenient to buy on Amazon."
5.0,How can so little work SO WELL?,"I recently purchased the multi-pack of pomegranate 5 Hour Energy shots for a driving trip, because I know that after only an hour on the road, I tend to fall asleep at the wheel.  When I have eight hours of driving ahead of me, that's not the safest place to be.  Now, I knew that 5 Hour had the potential to keep me alert, because I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY from Smiley360 and it had worked VERY well to keep me focused on house cleaning - why not driving?  Eyes drooping, halfway to Knoxville, I grabbed a 5 Hour Energy out of my purse and downed the thing.  I'll admit - the flavor isn't the greatest, and Orange and Pomegranate are the only flavors I've tried that I can tolerate.  However, within ten minutes I was alert, wide-eyed, singing along with the radio and finally appreciating the beautiful weather as I drove through the mountains.  5 Hour, you're a life saver!"
5.0,"nice for babyback ribs, dry rub!","very good for dry rubbing baby back ribs, tastes great, gives ribs a beautiful color!"
1.0,not worth it,"Just go to WalMart and buy the SmartyKat - cheaper, faster and BETTER!!  Can't believe we waited almost TWO WEEKS to get this junk -it is so IMpotent, both cats couldn't care less for it!"
1.0,I Highly recommended.,"Hei, customer!! If you like fragmentatized chips, this is the product for you. If you like to eat chips with a small spoon? You can not miss any of those.  I Highly recommended."
1.0,Horrible stuff,"This is the polar opposite of Sleepytime tea. I had one cup last night, and I laid in bed and didn't fall asleep till well after midnight, and then kept waking up every few minutes after that. Worst sleep I have gotten in my entire life! I'm going back to Sleepytime tea. At least that stuff works."
1.0,Metallic taste,"This coffee bean doesn't taste anything like the one i've tried in starbuck and at some oher candy store. It has a somewhat rusty or metallic taste that i can't figure out. Also the product arrived partially damaged i guess from the extreme heat, i just don't know if it has something to do with the overall prouct taste?"
1.0,Very Strange,"I usually really like Numi teas, and I like just about anything that has lime, but I did not like this tea.  Unappetizing color, too."
5.0,Delicious and Sugar Free - A Low Glycemic Wonder!,"Many years ago I began to suspect that sugar consumption was adversely affecting my health.  I cut it out of my diet and noticed an immediate improvement in my energy, and other great benefits as well.  I even went to a doctor and took the fasting test to see if I am diabetic or hypoglycemic but was told that I am not.  After that, I read ""Sugar Blues"", which further confirmed for me that sugar needed to be permanently removed from my family's diet.  Since then I have searched for ways to enjoy sweet treats without the negative effects of sugar.  This syrup is delicious and does not cause any of the problems I noticed after eating sugar!  It's wonderful after literally years of not enjoying pancakes and french toast to have this excellent product.  Thank you Fifty-50; your product is not just for diabetics!"
1.0,Nasty,"I only gave this a one star because there were no minus stars.  This stuff is just nasty.  Maybe its my taster or maybe we don't have the right water for it.  But, I did try the chocolate/peppermint flavor and it was yummy.  The instructions are just way off.  If I put in the correct amount of powder, the water/milk just changes colors...barely.  So, I add more and more.  By the time I can taste the flavor its just waaayyyy tooo much flavor and its bitter. This can says it has coffee in it but it is 10th on the ingredient list.  The first three ingredients are some sort of sugar.  For 8 ounces of water and 4 teaspoons of powder the calories are 60, the total fat grams are 2, 60mg of sodium, 11 grams of carbs, 8 grams of sugars and less than 1gram of protein.  Skip this colored water and drink some mud instead.  The mud will be the better tasting of the two."
1.0,Died very quickly,"I followed all the instructions and even looked up how to care for it online, but within a month the plant was dead.  I read online and they said the gel it is packaged with is toxic to the plant which caused it to die.  Do not buy this product from this seller!"
1.0,Does not work in sandy soil,Live in Florida and bought 4 of these traps based on the reviews here. This trap seems rather large for the size moles we have here in Florida. The tunnels which I could find are no bigger than 1 inch. The soil is so sandy that the trigger gets covered up and the tunnels collapse when trying to set this trap. I did as suggested and leveled the fist size mounds to see where the active tunnels were which showed up the next day. Not one trap went off. As far as placing the trap with the trigger above the ground (as suggested by some reviewers here) this makes no sense as the tunnels are NOT RAISED and there is no way the trap will go off. The traps were placed with the trigger in the tunnel so the moles would go under it and trigger the trap. Anyone living in a hot sandy soil area who has found a trap that will work please post.
1.0,Tastes like cough syrup,This tastes like horrible cough syrup.  It is nothing like cherry cola.  I tried using it several ways and it is just awful.
5.0,Why is this stuff so hard to find?,"My wife and I love this stuff; nothing else brings out the flavor of a good grilled steak, nothing. But it seems to be getting harder and harder to find. Have not been able to find it in bulk, so you have to buy it in the typical spice-rack sized bottles. And it is pretty expensive that way. Would love to buy a pound or so of it, but I guess I'm happy that I can still get it. C'mon Spice Islands, gimme a break....and get more distributors so I can buy it locally. The shipping charges are nearly a deal-breaker."
1.0,5lbs of hard!,"I reviewed these 5lb mini gummy frogs right after I received them about a month ago. It wasn't a favorable review either. I can't believe the last post on this product was over 6 months ago (Sept. 2010). They probably had 6 months of bad reviews...anyway, I'll try again and hope I'm able to warn you about these gummies. Let me first start out by says how much I LOVE Haribo gummies. When soft and fresh, these are definitely worthy of five stars. I love the green frogs and mini frogs the best. Whenever I am at Cost Plus (the only places I find the mini frog gummies) I'll purchase a small 5 oz bag at $1.79. So when I saw the latest deal through Amazon to get 5 lbs of mini frogs for cheap, I jumped on the deal. Yes, I did read all the reviews and saw the one and two star reviews before placing my order. But most were old posts, some years old. They've got to improve their product freshness issue by now, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, what arrived was a big block of hard, stale mini pellets (gummies). I was totally disappointed. Hence, my one star review. For those of you wanting soft gummies. Buy the 5oz - 12 packs. Those are tightly sealed packs and hold in the freshness better than the non-airtight packaging of the big 5 pounder. Not as good of a deal but you'll be getting a fresher product. Would I buy this product again? 5lb package: no. 5oz 12 pack: yes."
5.0,Love it!,"Very yummy. Mix with a tad bit of mayo and a yummy dip for shrimp or to put on a sandwich. It is hot, so take that into consideration. We will buy again!"
1.0,Deceptive item title,"The title says that this is raw cheese, yet the ingredients begin with pasteurized milk. Pasteurized is not raw. This is clearly an attempt to deceive consumers into purchasing a product that is not of the quality that is being claimed."
5.0,sweet potato treats,"great service, fast delivery the cadet sweet potato treats are a favorite of our doggies will purchase again from amazon"
1.0,poor advertising,There is no mention of the fact that these are singles.  The picture with this advertisement clearly shows the box that holds the four 2 QT packages.  This is poor.  Purchaser Beware!
5.0,Worth every penny!,"I know this is expensive, but when you open the can and see how much shredded chicken is in each can, it will make it all worth it.  It is amazing.  Both my cats love it and I love the quality.  At this price, I had to stock up.  My girls even ate the little bit of kale that was mixed in with the chicken and then licked their bowls clean.  I love giving them this food!"
1.0,Very Frustrated,I feel that I have really given this product a fair chance but I can't get it to work for me.  I have tried many different amounts of coffee and even running the Senseo with the filter completely empty and I still get leaking water all over the place.  I've seen several reviews with very satisfied users...what is the secret?
5.0,Harbo,These are the best Gummi Bears. My kids love them and they don't last very long in my house. Have placed 2 orders in a month.
1.0,shipping over kill,"the shipping was great... packaging great and the product, wonderful.  the shipping cost was out of line.  If my order was sent in a USPS flat rate boxes, you can get a much cheaper shipping cost and it is just as fast as UPS.  Especially to Nome, Alaska.  Shippers like UPS because of the ease of them picking up the items to ship but if they did their home work, they would see that the USPS does the same and it is so much cheaper...and to Nome Alaska...faster! Thank you for letting me vent! Patty Andersen A laska resident for 32 years"
5.0,A yummy treat for the office,Our office staff love this strong bold coffee.  It is a 2 in the afternoon favorite.  We will be ordering it again to keep our people going on those busy work days.
5.0,gotta dance,"As a 63 yr old this ""sodapop"" brought back memories of years gone bye...if you had a favorite drink in the ole days then this drink is for you"
5.0,sesame for me,"We enjoy sesame snaps for snacks and desserts, and we've tried several brands. This one doesn't get any better. Thanks Amazon."
1.0,Really?!,I would never buy this cake. It looks horrible. Some of the fondant work on this seller's other cakes is shabby the piping is horrible...worse than a cake you would buy at the grocery store. The flowers look like red and green blobs. How can you possibly think you should sell these to people?
5.0,Liked it,"This is one of my favorite veggie soups, pretty strong flavor, the batch i bought had no water at all, all solid lentil goodness. I eat one can with plain rice, it fills me up easily. Would buy it again. The ones from Walmart i bought a few months ago had more water which is cheating."
5.0,Excellent Product,This product has made a tremendous difference in my household.  I own 3 Pugs.  If anyone owns one Pug they know how much they shed.  I started all three on the Shed Stop and it was like a miracle overnight.  The dogs absolutely love the taste too.  I wholeheartedly indorse this product.
5.0,YES!  A SUGAR FREE MARSHMALLOW!,"I can not stress enough how good these are.  Our family was challenged with putting together a low-calorie/sugar-free SMORES kit.  They tasted great, melted great.  If you are looking for a sugar-free marshmallow.  This is the one you should buy!"
1.0,"Terrible, Simply Terrible.","I recently ran out of GMCR's ""Our Blend' and was forced to try Newman's Own.  It took my colleagues 20 minutes to convince me that I wasn't drinking urine.  It truly offended my taste buds.  You can taste the lack of passion and pride in this blend.  Newman could take a lesson from ""Our Blend"" - show a little pride for your work.  Don't be afraid to think outside the box to create a coffee that doesn't taste like cow sweat. That's what makes ""Our Blend"" great - you can taste the uniqueness and creativity in the brew.  My advice to Newman's Own: Step aside and let the artists behind ""Our Blend"" restore America's faith in coffee."
5.0,perfect,this product arrived on time and in perfect condition.  will definitely order from the vendor again.  thanks for such an easy process!
5.0,My favorite is O.N.E!!,"O.N.E. Coconut water is the liquid found inside young coconuts, not to be confused with coconut milk. Coconut water is found in the core of young, green coconuts. As the coconut matures this liquid largely becomes absorbed into the nut's flesh. Coconut water has long been a popular drink in the tropics, especially in Brazil, Tropical Asia and Trinidad and Tobago, where it is available fresh or bottled. It is naturally fat-free and low in food energy (16.7 calories or 70 kilojoules per 100 grams).  Coconuts for drinking are carefully packaged and sold in many places.  In Central America, particularly in Costa Rica, it is found and sold in strategic highway stops or on the beaches; there, the coconut water is called ""agua de pipa"", and the coconut is cut in front of the customer to ensure its freshness. O.N.E. Coconut water is a natural sports drink because of its high potassium and mineral content which helps the body recover from rigorous exercise.  I LOVE THIS O.N.E. Coconut Water!!"
5.0,great product great price,They are great in a salad or just great eating out of the package. It is a great price and perfect size snack bag.
1.0,Gross!,"Read the fine print before you buy this! I got it as a gift for a friend who is allergic to gluten but loves licorice. Turns out this is for 6 teeny tiny, barbie doll sized boxes of licorice. What look like juicy, chewy licorice bits in the photo are about the size of ice cream sprinkles in a tiny box. Plus they taste TERRIBLE and Amazon won't let you return food items, so now I'm stuck with a bunch of inedible tiny boxes of licorice! Yuck!"
1.0,"Watch the size, these are small cans!","The cans you see in all the stores are 18.8 oz., not the 10.75 oz. size listed here.  Makes a big difference when you're comparing prices."
1.0,extremely nasty,"My friend bought these, we both agreed they smell like old lipstick but it could have been a bad/old pack? Either way I haven't tried another since.  I wouldn't say they're very sour either, I bought the 'Sour power' brand which is leaps and bounds more sour and actually comes in distinctive flavors."
5.0,Amazing Coffee,I missed this coffee and finally found a good deal here on Amazon. To me it is worth the price as it is true french coffee. Be sure you use your french press on this one to get the full and proper flavor.
5.0,Great Cereal,"This cereal is great! The nutritional profile is fantastic for those looking to cut out all of the additives, preservatives, HFCS, etc, etc from the foods they eat. A great addition to a clean diet. I eat this everyday for breakfast!"
1.0,Awful,"This product is actually made with soybean oil and vegetable broth.  Unfortunately, you get plenty of both and it makes the tuna quite mushy and tasteless.  The one that's made in vegetable oil is superior in both taste and texture."
5.0,tasty,"This is the best tasting hot sauce ever, yes hot sauce with a flavor ,my first bottle of this sauce came from a VERY VERY good friend when I found out what grocery store it came from i bought all they had now they tell me they cant get it anymore :( so where do i go? Amazon , but shipping for 2 bottles of this fine hot sauce is more than the sauce its self ,"
5.0,Great Food at a Great Price!!,"I began my search for the perfect puppy food after finding out that Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet and other so-called ""Premium"" pet foods are basically the same junk as Kibbles 'n Bits, but with a premium price. My research led me to the Wellness brand, which is a great food but a bit on the pricey side. I stumbled across Chicken Soup and decided to compare the two, since the price was much more reasonable, but I honestly didn't expect it to come close to Wellness. ""Chicken Soup"" really blew me away! The ingredients are just as good, if not better, and my pups LOVE it. My only complaint is that the bag tears very easily, but if cheaper packaging keeps the price down I will live with it HAPPILY. I highly recommend this food, and I will be staying with this brand when my pups are old enough to transition to adult formula."
5.0,"delicious, great price too","I am just placing my order for the 2nd box. These taste better than the Wholefood,and Trader Joe's - Price at about 60% off theirs. Everyone who tasted this, from 4 year old to 84 year old loves it. The box of 4 lbs were gone in 2 weeks!! Best buy in snack for us in 2011."
5.0,Awesome.....,I use this to make iced tea and hot tea.....either way they come out perfect..  very flavorful and wold reccomend this to anyone wh ois looking to try a different tea experience
5.0,My favorite hot sauce,"This is, by far, my favorite hot sauce.  It is pretty mild, but packed with jalapeno flavor.  I use this in almost every soup, stew, and gumbo I make, as well as many other dishes.  I just bought four bottles of it, and wish it came in a larger bottle!"
1.0,Don't bother,"These Sweetleaf ""flavored"" products are only for people who want something really sweet with just the very barest whiff of some flavor (you probably won't even be able to tell which one it is). If you're looking for a product that's about half sweetness and half flavor, THIS ISN'T IT. I urge you to save your money and look for another solution."
5.0,SPORTea Iced Tea Bags,"This is a great buy. I usually buy from Whole Foods (believe it or not they have the best prices for this tea locally) but with free shipping this is a much better price. The tea is very refreshing and is just slightly sweet with a little hint of citrus. I avoid soda, caffiene, and anything with artificial sweetener so this tea really hits the spot."
5.0,AWESOME drink,IRONBEER is a great soft drink originated in CUBA (not mexico) and it is available in most supermarkets here in S. Florida so if you are ever in town get yourself a pack (6 for around 3 bucks). However if I didn't have access to it i would defenitely pay the bucks for it.
5.0,Just what the doctor ordered,"This Sugar Freen Banana flavoring is the perfect way to put a little something in your coffee and not mess with your blood sugar. The taste is natural and satisfying. Diabetics, Post-Gastric Bypass patients and anyone looking to keep an eye on blood sugar can add this to plain yogurt, coffee or batter to make boring fun. The seller was very fast in delivery. Best if used with recommended pump which helps manage sticky spills, keep bottle clean and dispense a consistent measure of flavoring every time."
1.0,Not the best choice,"I will NEVER buy this tea again. Earl grey smells like orange spice, peach and rasperry flavours hard to recognise."
5.0,Addicted! Very Good!,"These are the best Granola Bars you'll ever have. I think I am addicted to them. They're absolutely wonderful! :D With little fat and little calories (tasty too!) in each bar and being organic, these are awesome! The Choco-chip ones are really good, and are my favorite."
1.0,Inedible for smaller dogs,"I have always trusted the ""Newman's Own"" brand.  From popcorn to salad dressings, I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2"" X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a ""treat"". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on ""Newman's Own"" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again."
1.0,Not what I expected,"chocolate is always delicious but in this case the pieces were way to hard.  The candy coating was to thick and it made them kinda hard to eat.  I was afraid that I would crack a tooth!  My husband seemed to enjoy them but he had a similar opinion on how hard they were.  I think they would be better without the candy shell on the outside and instead of a whole almond in the middle maybe some almond pieces.  Im not going to buy these again, Ill just stick with the almond M&M's which are WAY better."
5.0,fabulous PB alternative,"I tried this because it was recommended by one of my favorite recipe websites and I LOVE it!! has a great texture and flavor. I do love the taste of soy, though, so that probably has something to do with it. I can eat it on my toast in the morning and not worry about the high fat (although its good fat) of regular PB. I do wish it had more protein though."
5.0,purchase,I get Constant Comments tea by the boxfuls quite often and have never once been dissapointed. They are proffesional and get my products here fast. Always happy with them. THANK YOU!
1.0,This milk tastes sour,My son and I both tasted this milk and it was terribly sour. I don't know if I just got a bad batch or what.
1.0,Yuckkk!,"If you want a low calorie food that tastes good, have a glass of water rather than this gross stuff! It is cheaper and far more satisfying. What a waste of money!"
1.0,Cat Loved it.. BUT....Their hair started to fall out.,Used for less then 2 months both cats fur began falling out bad. Stopped using it & the cats fur is back to fine. Back to feeding my cats Nature's Variety instinct. I baught this PetGaurd product at Fairway Market not Amazon. Will not use it again.
1.0,very disappointing,"I have been happy with most of the Green Mountain K-cups, but not this one. No sweetness that you might expect with carmel and/or vanilla taste. Sorry that I bought it, wish that I could return it!"
1.0,what is it really???,"I would like to try this, however I do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of, did I miss something? They only say what it is not! Would really like to know."
1.0,Thieves,"Tassimo increased the price for this pack of 2 Twinnings Chai form $19.98 to $34.98. I will go to BBB and return my Tassimo brewer. Tassimo, I hope you go bankrupt."
1.0,DECEPTIVE LABELING!,"This stuff is a horror show for those concerned about MSG (aka excitotoxins, or free glutamates). This stuff is laced with free glutamates! Autolyzed yeast extract is MSG! Hydrolyzed protein is MSG! Labeling laws allow MSG to be listed as ""natural flavor"" too. What a joke to advertise this as ""no msg"". MSG has many many aliases! This product contains transfats as well."
1.0,These bars are too expensive for how tiny they are.," Since I can't attach a photo to my review, I decided to take a video of my 8 year old son opening one of these bars so you can see first hand how small they are in comparison to a small boy's hands.  I purchased these for my son who has celiac disease.  We were incredibly disappointed on the packaging and size of these bars.  Based on the size of the box and the picture on the front, we expected full size bars - not a tiny gummy square.  Most of the packaging is air.  My son does like the taste of these however.  The packaging just seems misleading and they seem to be way too expensive for what they are."
1.0,"Yeast Extract = MSG, They DO Contain Preservatives!","Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these!"
5.0,Great food for dogs that have chronic loose stools,have tried pretty much every dog food for my 12 year old lab who gets terrible gas and diarrhea. Specialty formulas(Science Diet WD)  from the vet didnt work along with Solid Gold. This is the only food we have found that totally has solved her problem. No clue why there have been complaints. This food has really done the trick.
1.0,Tasty Treats - Questionable source,"Treats smell so good I would like to eat them myself. They are manufactured in China and they look shiny on the outside and I am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this. I have concerns because of China's reputation, plus they eat dogs in China,so how concerned could they be with making a clean expensive dog treat for rich Americans!"
1.0,Don't buy this item!,"I really wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this,unfortunately I bought it during a lightening deal and felt rushed to purchase it. Read the review I completely agree this product or sale is crap! The cute box in the picture isn't even in the shipped product, it all is just tossed in a shipping box with some cheezy saying I can't even read because it's covered in shipping labels, and tape. I opened the box to find the majority of the weight it a 1 liter bottle of some soda I have never heard of, and I would say about 50% of the candy wasn't even legit, and most of it was generic! Seriously disappointed in this product. I could have created something unique myself with candy from the $1 store because that's what this felt like! So save yourself some time and money and don't buy this product."
5.0,Great Choice for Halloween Candy,"Jelly Bellies are absolutely the BEST jelly beans!  I purchased these for Halloween candy, because we don't usually have many trick-or-treaters, and adults love the leftovers.  This box has 36 sealed 1-oz. packets (2-3/8"" x 5""), each with about 26 jelly beans in assorted flavors.  The flavors vary from packet to packet, but include licorice, buttered popcorn, watermelon, and bubble gum, in addition to the usual vanilla and fruit flavors.  For smaller packets (.35 oz.) that are also suitable for Halloween, take a look at these:   Jelly Belly Jelly Beans, Assorted Flavors, 0.35-Ounce Bags (Pack of 80) ."
5.0,My dog loves these,"These pill pockets are great, dogs think they are treats!  For small pills, I cut them in half so they go further.  They make it so easy to give my dog his meds!"
1.0,Prickly Pear Syrup -,"I was soo excited to get this prickly pear syrup because I had wanted to make a pricky pear juice drink and this was the closest I could find. I put club soda in with this syrup and didn't get the taste I was hoping for. It's way TOO sweet and just not as good as I had hoped. I am disappointed,"
5.0,Wonderful~Childhood Revisited~Just like I remembered it!,"I thought this product was no longer available. Then by chance I found it here. It is so good I cannot find the words to describe it. It just arrived and I had a can opened and a slice warmed up with butter on it within 5 min. I sat and savored it for 20 min, taking tiny bites. It is 100% the same as when I was a child. So moist. It is 130 calories for a 1/2 inch slice which is plenty as it is so rich in flavor. It is almost like cake. In the 1960's we ate slices of it with the B and M Boston Baked beans. My mother also sliced it thin and put creamcheese or marshmellow cream between 2 slices and sent it as a treat for my grade school lunches.  It you want a healthy yummy taste of the past try this bread. The value is fantastic also. I checked a few other websites and it was sky high in price. Highly Recommend."
5.0,Great value noodles,"Well worth the money, especially on auto-ship. Absolutely a great value, not to mention tasty and delicious! Would definitely purchase again."
5.0,Pleasant surprise,I was pleasantly surprised with the taste of this tea. Great lemon flavor that is not in any way overpowering. I highly recommend this product. Great taste!!!
1.0,2nd BEWARE - Baby Had BAD Reactions to this Food,"Our 6-month old had been eating rice cereal for 2 months when our order of Earth's Best Rice Cereal from Amazon arrived.  He has not had any major illnesses in the past.  Upon his first feeding of this product, he became ill (vomited).  We tried feeding him cereal again in an hour, and he vomited profusely- drawing a fever.  After a visit to the pediatrician, we were told he had a ""virus"" (code for, ""we don't know what it is"").  We switched him back to breast milk for the next 2 weeks, expecting his tummy couldn't handle cereal while he had a virus.  The fever itself had passed the same day as his vomiting.  Fast forward to last night- all is well and we attempt to feed him a small bit of the Earth's Best Rice Cereal.  He began to vomit profusely to the point where we had to rush him to the emergency room for fear of dehydration (we were told he needed an IV).  He had a fever and was extremely pale and floppy.  We were scared.  After 3 hours in the emergency room (waiting) we were able to breastfeed him and he kept it down with no trouble; color returned; no fever; he's back to his old self.  Doctor wasn't sure WHAT was going on (virus or otherwise).  We realized that the ONLY three times he got this sick was when he ate this cereal.  He is not allergic to any of the ingredients on this box.  He is fine now and we've contacted Amazon about this.  They claim they may pull this product."
5.0,My favorite black tea,"This is my favorite black tea on the Keurig.  It's good black tea, without any extra ingredients like sweeteners added.  I like this brand because it's rich enough to brew very large cups, but never bitter tasting.  I prefer to drink this plain over ice, or mixed with a touch of lemonade.  I've tried most of the other brands, but many are either too weak for a large cup, or too bitter to drink plain."
5.0,Absolutely Delicious!!!,"If you like coconut, you will enjoy this coffee.  It's one of my favorite K-cup flavors!!!  Don't hesitate to buy!"
1.0,Showed up Leaking and Broken,"I bought this for my mother in law who has an allergic reaction to everything.  I was excited when I saw this was something she could drink and ordered it for her birthday with a custom made wine glass.  It showed up opened and leaking.  NOT impressed.  If they can't fix their packaging and delivery, I would seriously look elsewhere to buy.  They won't even send her a new one.  They'll give her credit but won't refund the cost or send her a new one."
5.0,"Good, Mostly Organic Cookies","I have not had ginger snaps in a long time, so I was excited to get these.  They contain mostly organic ingredients and are very good!  They taste ""fresher"" than most store-bought cookies and less processed.  They aren't too hard or too soft, though ginger snaps are harder than normal cookies.  There are wheat and soy ingredients in them, so if you have an allergy to those two things, then you're out of luck.  I also don't know if I would call them vegan since they are ""manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, tree nuts, and dairy.""  The ingredients do not list any animal products, so it just depends on how ""vegan"" you want to be.  There are 130 calories in 5 cookies which is not bad, and only 30 of those calories are from fat.  I would recommend these and would buy them again next time I get a craving for ginger snaps."
5.0,everything you want for your little one,"I was sad when I wasn't able to breastfeed anymore when I became pregnant again(lost my supply) and picking a formula was hard. After much research I found Earth's Best organics to be a very easily accessible organic formula, the transition was easy and my baby has no trouble digesting it. It's great choice you can feel good about giving your baby. I would recommend it for any mom who is unable to breastfeed, but if your baby's not here yet and you're looking at formulas, remember 'breast is best' and always try that first."
1.0,why so expensive?,This is almost twice the price it should be.  Why?  And why not carry Intenso and Delicato?  It was selling at Amazon for less than the distributors at one time.  This is marvelous coffee.
1.0,Mediocrity,"Price is okay, without free shipping it is not a good deal. The stuff seems to be on the old side. I cannot find any date info on the packaging. It's ramen noodles, whaddya want?"
5.0,YUMMY!,"This honey is SO GOOD! I'm not even kidding when I say that when I have a sweet tooth, I will literally take a spoon and eat a teaspoon of this and I'm satisfied. I use it in my tea, on my toast, bagels, this stuff rocks! I bought some for my Mom and she went nuts over it too. I tried Agave nectar and as it turns out, I'm allergic to it. I got itchy and dizzy and my heart felt like it was going to pound of of my chest! Stevia just left me with a bad aftertaste. YUCK! This honey is awesome, I highly recommend it!  Great alternative to sugar."
5.0,An excellent balsamic vinegar at a great price.,"This balsamic vinegar has 4% acidity so it is more mellow than most balsamic that you would find on the supermarket shelves. And it is thick like a syrup.  It is great for dipping and for drizzling over fruits or ice cream. Have not tried using it as a meat glaze but I'm sure that will taste great, as well."
5.0,great dark roast,If you like dark strong coffee-- this is the one for you.  I have been buying this coffee for two years and love it
1.0,Hexane in organic formula!,"I am very mad at myself for not doing better research before selecting formula once my breast milk supply dwindled.  Do your own search!  The Obama Admin has said that organic formula should no longer be allowed to be marketed if it contains dha/ara made with hexane.  Organic foods for adults are not allowed to be labeled as organic if they are made with  hexane.  There are several articles out there discussing possible side effects including autism and ADHD from hexane.  I am switching to Baby's Only which is the only organic formula that contains Dha/ara not manufactured using hexane.  It says it is a toddler formula which is why I didn't consider using it to begin with.  Do your own research, supposedly they market it that way to support breastfeeding exclusively for the first year.  It meets. The infant Formula requirements.  I am hoping to return the box of Earth's Best hexane formula I paid so much for thinking I was doing something good for my son.  Red the review here that copies the response from Baby's Only about it being suitable for infants   Babys Only Organic Dairy Formula Case (6 cans) ."
1.0,NOT AS PICTURED!,"When I ordered, the photo of the can clearly stated ""e...San Marzano"".  When I received the Carmelina cans the ""e...San Marzano"" was not on any of my cans.  San Marzano tomatoes command a premium price and I question the value of these."
1.0,consumer lab report on dogswell happy hips,"consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable, to low"
5.0,Loving PERO  is good for me,"PERO is excellent and good for avoiding an additional product, containing caffeine.  I choose this produce because it is tasty and has no side effects."
1.0,False advertising,"Calling this a ""Protein Snack Bar"" is bordering on fraud.  It has four times as many grams of carbohydrates as protein.  This is actually a ""Carbohydrate Snack Bar"", otherwise known as a candybar."
5.0,wonderful,"I bought these gummies up at our local mall, and they are amazing! >w< They taste like a perfectly ripe kiwi, and there are also little kiwi seeds inside the gummies themselves :3 You also get quite a lot of great tasting gummies in the package, so the price is worth the end result."
1.0,It is not mangosteen,It is not mangosteen. I eat mangosteen fresh fuit before in Brazil and this does not have anything to do with that exotic fruit. You are not selling mangosteen you are selling lichi
1.0,The Moles will be safe with this piece of junk,Don't waste your time buying this piece of junk. The instructions must have been done by a three year old and trap cannot be set as shown. Customer service people do not even repond to my inquiries.
1.0,Surprise coconut flavor,"I buy several of the Think Thin bar flavors - tried this one and found, to my dismay, that it has a pronouonced coconut flavor, which is okay if you like coconut.  Flavor is darker, but muddier, and ingredients list a fractionated palm kernel oil, which is not in the other bars I buy.  Would not purchase it again."
1.0,Formula changed dramatically,"These new formula Potato Buds are horrible.  Betty Crocker changed the formula recently and the result is the worse instant mash potatoes ever, as compared to their original version that was the best in class.  Now the texture is sticky and gummy, and there is no potato flavor.  To make it even worse, there is a disagreeable aftertaste that remains for several hours.  I strongly suggest trying a small box from your local store to try, before committing to this new version.  I think you will find that any other brand is better.  The change by Betty Crocker is a big mistake, and it will result in a loss of customer loyalty, including mine."
5.0,Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed,"This is the 2nd order i have placed for Bob's Red Mill Organic Flaxseed. It is a good quality whole flaxseed. We grind it a little at a time and sprinkle it on cereal and in yogurt. It keeps a long time in the freezer. I have been using this flaxseed for about a year now ,eating a tablespoon about every day and have noticed that my skin is softer , plus it keeps me regular, if ya know what i mean !!! Flaxseed is also a good way to get in some of the Omega 3's, that the body needs."
5.0,delicious specialty dish mushrooms,"I have found consistently high quality in almost every Roland product I've ordered over the years, with very few exceptions.  I ordered these straw mushrooms to make Thai Tom Yum soup but use them in miscellaneous stir fry dishes also.  My husband who tends to complain about some kinds of mushrooms really likes these. Some mushrooms (portabellini for example) can get dried out and rubbery if they are overcooked even a little.  These canned straw mushrooms stay soft - not mushy. And they taste good, too!  The only thing that could make these mushrooms better (and other Roland products as well) is if Roland changes to BPA-free can linings.  That would be wonderful!  Unfortunately all the cans in my first delivery were totally bashed/smashed (way beyond dented!). As always, the customer service rep was most gracious and the replacement shipment arrived in perfect condition in its own sturdy cardboard  shipping box.  I actually placed this order as a separate order but the shipping department combined this order with 5 others, some of which were my monthly subscribe and save items, and threw them all into one big box.  Most of you ""out there"" know that Amazon has a problem in its shipping department with people who have not been trained to not throw a heavy cardboard case of canned goods on top of bubble wrapped cans.  Bubble wrap can only do so much!  I am becoming more and more hesitant about ordering any canned products from Amazon and that is a shame because I've done a high percentage of my shopping on Amazon for several years and would like to continue to do so."
5.0,As hot as advertised!,"I've always loved hot, spicy food, and after hearing about the Ghost Chili on ""Man vs. Food,"" I decided I had to check them out.  Did some research on the internet, including watching videos of people eating dried Ghost Chilis, and still thought ""no way are they that much hotter than a Habenero.""  They are.  So hot, in fact, that the huge bag of dried Bhut Jolokai peppers I recieved in the mail is enough to last for years- a half-teaspoon of the dried peppers ground up is enough to make a huge pot of chili very hot, the same amount in a container of home-made salsa renders it un-edible by all but a very few ""hot-heads.""  Smoky and spicy at the same time, it has a heat that builds a little slower than other hot peppers and lingers longer, with a definite sinus-clearing component and a catch in your throat.  For super spicy food lovers only, be careful when handling them as well."
5.0,Very yummy!,"These candies have a very unique flavor, and it is a very yummy one at that! However, I think most people would enjoy the flavor because it is not 'odd' or too overbearing/strong. I would recommend these :)"
1.0,i got only 2 boxes!!!!! I want my money back!!! I am so mad***,"I love this snack and when i read  Product Features Two cases of six boxes, each containing six .77-ounce bags of crackers (72 total bags) ***i got 12 bags*** Low-calorie, crunchy blend of crackers, Ritz bits and pretzels No trans fats or cholesterol Just 100 calories per pack; all of the flavor, and none of the guilt Single-serve packs ideal for lunchboxes  i thought great deal....but today it came and i only have 2 boxes... What the heck. i can get that at walmart for 2 packages for 4.00  i dont get it...what a rip off!!!  very misleading go to the store and buy it yourself. I will never buy food from amazon again last time i did it was expired i should of learned!!!!"
1.0,Main ingredients SALT and MSG.,"What else is there to say? If you want MSG in your food, buy a bottle of Accent, use your own salt and pepper and save lots of money.  Big Fail McCormick. MSG causes all kinds of health issues."
1.0,Very disappointed in the packaging,"It just looks like someone bought a bunch of random k-cup packs and through individual cups into a box, slapped on some tape, and marked up the price a bit.  The k-cups were just floating free in a long, white box.  There was plenty of open space in the box so they weren't shipped securely at all.  Luckily none of them burst open.  We purchased this as a gift and ended up having to arrange these ourselves in a different box so it didn't look cheesy.  I just hope the various coffee is decent.  Finally, be prepared for several teas and a few decaf coffees.  So a little less than 30 are regular coffee."
5.0,Highly recommended.,"I am so glad I tried this premium dog food at a great price for a small (but not too small) bag to try it. My dog loves it and I feel better about giving her something healthy. Next I will try the canned food. I do wish these companies would offer 6 can deals however instead of just 12 and 24 can deals for ""taste-testing"". Not every dog likes a drastic change from junk foods to higher quality food. Meanwhile, no more Purina ever!"
5.0,Dentyne Ice Mints. Truly the strongest mint available.,I can't find this product in any of my local California stores so I value this retailer. I would reccomend them.
1.0,Too salty and dry!,I ordered these chips and found them to be very salty and dry! There was a huge amount of spices in a ball in one of the bags I opened.
1.0,Not the best....,"I recently became diabetic and i had to find a sugar sub. Ive tried mny different, and this was by far the worse. Everytime I used it, there was this sickly taste to it, and i ended up getting a stomach ache after I used it. I'd rather stick to Splenda then anything."
5.0,"YOU HAVEN'T TRIED TEA, UNTIL YOU'VE TRIED IMPRA!","I was not a regular tea drinker until six months ago, when I spent time at my girlfriend's parent's home.  Her family is from Russia, where they culturally drink tea ALL DAY, EVERY DAY...  So, as you can imagine they offered me a cup of tea, and I said ""sure"", because I thought tea was nice to drink (but certainly not my favorite thing to drink).  I was blown away with how good this IMPRA KNIGHT tea is!  It is NOT bitter, but very smooth and gentle to the taste buds.  I am now a regular tea drinker!  I have also ordered the IMPRA EARL GREY tea, which is absolutely amazing tea as well (earl grey is spiced with a hint of bergamot - a small lime that grows in Europe).  The back side of the IMPRA tea boxes are written in Russian, the front side in English, so apparently they market the tea on both sides of the globe.  I guess it is fair to say, you haven't tried tea until you've tried IMPRA!  No joke.  To back up this claim, I've introduced IMPRA to my father, mother, sister, friends, etc...  all who are Americans - and not usual tea drinkers - and they've all been blown away with IMPRA.  They now drink it regularly."
5.0,Fantastic crema!,"I get rave reviews from everybody who has a cup of my Lavazza.  I have a built in Miele machine that loves these beans and produces a fantastic, deeply flavored, highly aromatic coffee with a rich crema topping."
1.0,Snacks are great but this is a rip off,"I agree with the previous posts. It is a little misleading, I also thought I was getting six boxes and instead got 5 packets. I will read more carefully in the future. This is far over priced from this seller."
1.0,~~so disappointing~~,I'm 35yo and I remember eating this stuff for breakfast all throughout my youth.  I loved it.  Loved it to the point that there were days that I would eat it for breakfast and dinner if I could get away with it.  For some reason I stopped eating it.  I saw this and decided it was time start it up again.  I'M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!  The flavor is completely different.  The end product is soupy and letting it sit for a bit doesn't help.  The portions sizes do seem like they might be a bit bigger but that's the only good thing I can come up with.  It might be a healthy choice but I think I'll just stick to my fresh fruit breakfasts.  This is just bad.
5.0,Best Drink Mixes,"These are the BEST drink mixes available. I love the individual pouches and the wide variety of flavors. We used to sell Big Train coffee drinks at our restaurant. When we closed, I was sad, thinking I would not be able to have these drinks again. Then we found the mixes at Amazon and I was so excited. I kept our restaurant blender when we closed and start every day with a Big TRain drink. I save so much money, not having to drive to Starbucks for their drinks anymore. As a bonus, severalof the mixes can be made hot or cold, so they are good to have year round."
1.0,Tasts like muddy water!,I am Brazilian and have always loved anise seed tea.  This tea is dirt and makes tea that tastes like muddy water! Now I am stuck with this stuff and don't know what to do with it!  I don't know where I can find good anise tean in the United States.  When I first came to the U.S. there was a source but they went out of business.
5.0,Scrumdiddiliumptious,"These are the best coffee beans I've ever tasted in my life. Be careful with how many you eat though, you could be up all night!"
5.0,"Delish, and a good price","I love these Snapea crisps, and so do my kids.  Now, I realize they aren't exactly a health food, but as far as junk food goes, I consider them to be on the good end of the spectrum.  Thanks for carrying these, Amazon!"
1.0,Big mistake,"My cat, who has been on a gluten-free all-canned diet for a few years, did not like this food.  I got her to eat maybe two tablespoons over the course of two days and that was all it took to wreak havoc with her system.  I bought the food based on my complete satisfaction with the same brand of canned food and also because I would like to be able to feed dry food in addition to canned.  I thought my cat would appreciate some variety as would I.  So here I am wide awake at 3 am laundering sheets because immediately after a near liquid litter box episode she bee-lined it for my bed.  Obviously this food is a huge success in some households and I wish more than anyone that my experience was positive too.  But considering my lost night's sleep, the total waste of money, and the negative impact on my cat's health, what other rating can I give this product?  I rate based on my own experience and this purchase was disastrous for me and my cat so I give one star."
1.0,Not pleased,"When the fruit slices were delivered, the sugar coating had melted away & there was runny juice at the bottom of the package.The slices looked as though they had been tossed to & fro & did not look anything like the picture. They were limp & gooey looking. I was asked to remove my negative feedback if given a refund however, I feel that others should know on the ratings here. I was refunded the amount but had ordered this particular item for my daughter's cooking party. I ended up not using them as they were not very pretty after the delivery ! If you live a distance away, make sure you ask that Bierman's put ANY item that can ""melt"" or get too heated on ice !"
5.0,best coffee ever,"I was having trouble finding a good everyday coffee for my new Keurig. I like a strong flavor, but all the ""bold"" ones I tried were too bitter, some even tasted burned. The ""not-bold"" ones were too weak. I decided to give the San Francisco Bay Fog Chaser a try because of the reviews, recommendations from friends, and I like their minimal packaging. This coffee is great! Exactly what I was looking for, a strong rich coffee flavor with no bitterness. Perfect for me!"
5.0,Best Dry Food HANDS DOWN!,"***For the person with 1 star It states quite clearly on their site FAQ: DOES THIS FOOD CONTAIN ETHOXYQUIN? Taste of the Wild Pet Foods sources all protein meals (chicken meal, fish meal, etc) from vendors that do not use ethoxyquin. As always, only natural preservatives are used in our manufacturing process to preserve the foods.  So why someone would review this and give it 1 star is beyond me! I started to use this after my smooth coat chihuahua Herbie seemed a little sickly. I didnt realize soy and grain is not a good thing for our animals. I previously used Royal Canin.  He's full of energy and his coat is darker and shiny! We also augment his food with the Tast Of The Wild Wetlands food and he loves that also.  The high protein content means the animal will be less hungry and consume less food in the long run.  Think about it if you eat chicken or steak your less hungry than if you ate a bunch of rice because carbs get burned quickly. BUY this food your doggy will thank you for it!"
5.0,Awesome......!!My daughter loves it!,"My 4 yr old daughter never eats breakfast and she is a picky eater.From where we come from,we are not used to cold milk out of the refridgerator,plain warm milk is not my daughter's favorite.After I found out abt this product,I didn't have to look bk.This replaced the nesquik I was giving her earlier.This is less sugary and for  vegetarians like us,this was a great source of proteins.I would like the product to be even less sugary(especially the strawberry flavored) so that even I can drink it and it will be a great meal substitute.Overall a great product for picky eaters.....!!"
1.0,where's the tripe,"My dogs go nuts for tripe, so I thought this would be an easy way to give them what they love in biscuit form. I was not impressed nor were they. It is not smelly and looks very wholesome with good fresh biscuit qualities, the problem is the only thing I could smell was parsley, there was no hint of tripe smell to it and that is what dogs love. My two spoiled fur buddies just sniffed and walked away. I won't order any more."
1.0,"Great product, BUT IT IS NOT HALAL!","The product in and of itself is great.  The chicken bouillon has great flavor and works well in recipes.  But, I called the manufacturer of this product today (Nestle USA) and they told me that they do not have halal certification for this product here in the United States.  Therefore, it is not halal.  The man told me that they do sell a milk product called Milo, which can be found here in the US as halal.  But, this product is not halal.  I just wanted to write this review because the message behind it is so important for my Muslim brothers and sisters out there."
5.0,Love these!!!!,"Unlike the other flavors of the Ice Breakers Mines line, the taste of the Cinnamon doesn't get old or tired. Because you have to travel a minimum of 200 miles outside the St Louis Market to get this one flavor, I thought I would give mail order a try. I normally depend on traveling family and friends to bring them back to me."
1.0,Bad Stuff,This has to be the worst tasting coffee I have ever had in a k-cup. I buy a lot of k-cups this is the by far the worst. Don't waste your money on this product.
1.0,Nutritional Misdirection,"Each packet of this soup is NOT single serving size!  ...and the packaging does very little to correct that misperception: the soup is shown in a coffee mug-sized scenario. You're supposed to add 4 cups of water to each packet; which is more soup than anyone is looking for at lunchtime. Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons? You're supposed to forget that consuming a reasonable amount of soup fills you with 100 percent (if not more) of your daily sodium intake.  This is an absurd product."
1.0,Read the fine print...,"I am giving this tea a rating of 1. I have not tried it yet, so it may actually be the best tea in the world, HOWEVER, no where in the general or the technical description does it say that this tea INCLUDES Sage and Lavender. If you blow up the picture of the product, it does say in the small print on the label that these two ingredients are included. That being said, I wanted 100% pure Guayusa tea -- which was implied by the written descriptions -- not Guayusa with other ingredients. It would cost almost as much to ship it back as was paid, so I will keep it, but please, Amazon, update your description showing the added ingredients!"
5.0,DELICIOUS TORTILLA CHILLI,"The soup reminded me of chili so I added pinto beans to the soup & ate it with cornbread.  Delicious, Nutritious & Easy! An instant family hit!  NOTE: I strive to incorporate items on hand into recipes, especially when buying in bulk. It also makes a shorter grocery list!   Natural Value Organic Beans, Pinto, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12) "
1.0,YUCK,I thought these were the same as I purchased at Christmas time from Costco.  I purchased these for Valentine's Day and they are just awful - they taste like cocoa covered lard.  Don't care what the price is - I'd rather have a delicious taste like the ones from Costco (they don't have them anymore).  I don't know how anybody can say these taste delicious !!  They have no taste at all.
5.0,My fine hair looks thicker! And I love the subtle aroma!,"I'm completely satisfied with  CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce  because it does what the advertising says: makes my hair softer, shinier, well-nourished and better moisturized... All that and it smells good too!  The one complaint I have is the same as another reviewer: When I opened the manila envelope it arrived in, shampoo dribbled out onto my hands. At first I thought the shampoo container had exploded, but it actually leaked through the lid. Since the lid wasn't secure, I had to funnel it into another shampoo bottle in order to use it. That's nothing against the product; rather it's against the packager, so this product still deserves five stars, in my opinion.  Review by Betty Dravis, June 20, 2012 Author of award-winning ""1106 Grand Boulevard"""
5.0,Very well received,I was on the phone with my friend when she received this basket so I know she and her family enjoyed it very much.  She said it was beautiful and that there was soooo much stuff in it.  It was nice to hear the hapiness in her voice during such a difficult time!
1.0,Zatarain's Tuna Cake Mix,"I tried the Tuna Cake Mix, added tuna Disappointed! I then added crab to a batch, since the main ingridence is the same for tuna, or crab. Still the same, not what I expected. Your better off making these from scratch."
1.0,read your ingredients people,"these treats contain corn products and BHA AND BHT very bad for dogs also RED COLORING dont buy these give stomach aches and loose stool they also purchase ingredients from china yes they are ""made"" in the usa but not all ingredients are from the usa before being placed in this"
5.0,Delicious!,My family of 4 loves this product.  This is our second bulk order of this product from amazon!
5.0,Delicious Hot Cocoa,"I am very impressed with this hot cocoa for two reasons.  It has a delicious dark rich chocolate flavor and it's made from simple, natural ingredients.  There aren't any corn syrup solids or vegetable oils in this product, unlike most hot cocoa mixes sold in stores.  I love it!  I usually add less mix than the directions call for, though, or the taste is too sweet for my family's liking."
1.0,molded chestnuts,"The chestnuts arrived closed in a plastic bag and they were all wet... Not a surprise only about 2 out of 25/30 chestnuts were not molded. Everybody knows that chestnuts should be kept in a breathable bag, such as canvas, cloth or paper bag, not sure why the seller ships them in plastic: mold is unavoidable in plastic. Maybe is a biological safety issue. I'm glad I tried 5-6 chestnuts at home before give them as a Christmas gift. I have to throw all them away."
1.0,Gustaf's Dutch Licorice Nighmare,"This product tasted more like bleach than licorice.  I actually LIKE salt licorice, but this brand was just ugh.  It has a definite stong bleachy undertaste. Don't buy it unless you have tasted it first!"
1.0,Does not work; severe cramps continue,"As I write this, I am doubled over with pain and so nauseated I can barely keep from throwing up.  I am on my third cup of tea.  Yesterday I had four, and before that I had two, then two again on the day before that.  So I can say with absolute assurance that it does not work for me.  Please don't waste your money on this product if you have debilitating cramps each month, because this tea will not so much as ""take off the edge.""  It seems only those women who are lucky enough to have ""minor aches and pains"" each month will find relief from their symptoms with this tea."
1.0,Accent Does Have Lots of Sodium,"MSG is the sodium salt of the amino acid glutamic acid and a form of glutamate. It is sold as a fine white crystal substance, similar in appearance to salt or sugar. It does not have a distinct flavor of its own, and how it adds flavor to other foods is not fully understood. Many scientists believe that MSG stimulates glutamate receptors in the tongue to augment meat-like flavors. -- FDA"
5.0,Great Beans Horrible Price,"I have purchased these beans before when they were in the $2.00 a package range.  They are tasty athough my Mexican friends say they are not as good as Mom's. At almost $5.00 a package with a modest $7.00 for shipping, thats only $1.00 for each ounce, brings the beans to a total price $12.00 for just 7 oz.  A man would be a fool to pass up this deal.  Pound for pound it would be cheaper to fly Mamacita in from Mexico so you could experience the real deal.  Sorry no sale at these prices."
1.0,Check ingredients before purchasing!!,"The labeling debate continues ... Natural... Doesn't mean it's natural to consume! How can a product geared towards children that boasts 'made with real fruit and vegetable juice' also contain an ingredient that among other things, prohibits the normal absorption of vitamins and is used to clean industrial products? Please search 'mineral oil' before purchasing Motts products. There are healthy gummy alternatives out there or you can offer actual fruit and vegetables at snack time. I am referring specifically to Mott's Medleys assorted fruit fruit flavored snacks. Let's keep our kids healthy!!!"
1.0,Strange spots and metallic taste,Sardines had strange brown and yellow spots on them.  There was an off putting metallic after taste.  Caught in Cali but processed in Vietnam compromising freshness.  Still in search of quality sardines for the Omegas.
1.0,GOOD coffee. BAD price.,Don't buy this coffee here!! You're paying more than the retail value!! K-cups should average out to be about 50 to 65 cents a cup MAX.
1.0,made my baby gag!,"My 7-month old son was recently diagnosed (through blood tests) with a milk allergy. He's had bad cradle cap and eczema on his face since he was about two months old. After trying MANY other formulas (Enfamil, Good Start Gentle Plus, Good Start Soy, Similac Advance, Baby's Only Soy), the doctor finally suggested going hypoallergenic. So we tried Nutramigen... he seemed okay for the first couple of minutes, then he pulled the bottle out of his mouth and gagged. I tried again... and again, he drank for a minute or two, then gagged again. Then he refused to drink any more. After reading up on hypo formulas I was expecting a bad smell, but I didn't think it'd be bad enough to make my son want to hurl!  My son never had any problems drinking all of the other formulas; this is the only one that actually made him gag. Maybe if I had started it earlier when his tastebuds were more immature, I would've had more success. I'm hesitant to give him the Alimentum because of the high sugar content. I guess my son will just have to continue suffering with rashes until I can find a formula that works for him. :("
5.0,Terrific and all Natural,"This rice is natural, no additives and we really like! We always add a little bit of water before we put in microwave and it is fantastic.  Looking for something low in sodium and that tasted good---no sodium and fine taste.  We add spices if we want before we heat.  It is the easiest rice we have ever had and it is good for protein as well.  Thanks Amazon for carrying.  Oh yes, try the subscription service and you save even more $$$."
5.0,How do I love fruit cake?,"I'll tell you how I love Claxton fruitcake.  With the crunchy nuts and the moist fruit, it is to die for.  My family does not care for traditional fruit cake with the citron, so Claxton is the answer.  It comes to us with all the goodness sealed in and ready to slice and serve. FRUIT CAKE Boxed -1 lb Regular Recipe Claxton Fruitcake "
5.0,No Problems,Product arrived perfectly in tact and on time with a good couple months before the expiration date.
5.0,Great dog food!,"I have been feeding this food to my bulldog for the past four years and out of all the brands I've tried, this has been the best!  I hear people say all the time what bad gas their bulldogs have, but I don't have that problem with mine, and I am sure that what I feed  him makes a huge difference.  I would definitely recommend this food!"
1.0,Sampler?,"I was really looking forward to receiving a sample of jerky to try. However, of the 10 items five were antelope sticks and two were ostrich sticks. So for 10 possible different flavors I only received five and 50% was one flavor.  Furthermore they were all date stamped before the date I ordered. I certainly hope that is not a sell by date.  This is not what I expected."
1.0,Unmarked Paper bag,"Well, I got an unmarked paper bag full of K-Cups. And only got 24 cups of the 30 I paid for. This is the first time I bought k-cups on amazon and probably the last."
5.0,My kitten has been eating this for six months,"This food is economical; because you can (and should) moisten it with water, one 10-pound bag makes 30 pounds of cat food. It's nutritionally complete, fortified with both taurine and carnitine (amino acids which occur naturally in meat, but are usually processed out in the making of meat-based animal foods and have to be added back.)  It is much ""cleaner"" than meat-based pet foods in which--regardless of what the customer is led to believe--a company can include all sorts of ""meat by-products""--hair, beaks, feathers, and even ear tags. Considering that rates of heart disease and cancer among cats and dogs parallel those of their human companions, there must be a better way to feed them. Animals being fed Evolution are regularly living over 20 years now, and with far fewer geriatric problems such as arthritis and heart disease than their carnivore counterparts.  Best of all, cats like it; my young cat has been eating it for several months now and is thriving, with a glossy coat. For variety, I also give him Evolution canned food, which he loves."
1.0,what quantity is it!,I wouldn't even think of buying this product unless I know the price per unit. How can I compare other items online or in a store?
5.0,Super deal.,Great product.  Very flavorful.  This item is always a giant hit when the box arrives.  I highly recommend this for anyone that likes high quality gummies and a great deal.
5.0,My favorite Starbucks coffee.  Yum!,"I have tried several of the Starbucks coffees and enjoy many of them, but Kenya is my absolute fave.  Waking up to its smell makes me immediately happy :).  Thanks, Starbucks for going all over the world to find very yummy coffees!"
5.0,"You can't beat the bold flavor in this sauce, you guys","Take it from me, you can't beat the bold flavor in this sauce, you guys. Just when you think it might be a bit too spicy for you, the creamy ranchero flavors come around to make you want more. Try it on pizza while you're having a few cold ones! Maybe Chili's could come up with a sauce like this???? That would rock."
1.0,Unbelivable tasteless.,"Title say it all. About 90 percent of the content is just the little bit salty messy tasteless tiny crab meat. I can garantte even water boiled chicken taste better than this. Avoid at all cost since they come with Pack of 12, and I think I will never touch the second can."
5.0,Excellent Salt but don't buy here!!!,"Shoppers beware, the same 1/2lbs bag of salt costs only $2.75 if you buy direct from the company. Just google Celtic Sea Salt. Can't believe the Amazon vendor has marked up the price so much. What a rip-off!"
1.0,So bad I thought I was doing something wrong,This looks absolutely delicious from the picture. I love pad thai and the thought of a cheap quick tasty one was really intriguing. The sauce burns when you cook it and the taste is abysmal...I then tried adding more water to dilute the sticky black goo they call there sauce. It got better but this is still by far the worst pre-packaged meal I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor and save your money...this company should be absolutely ashamed...someone had to have tasted this before selling it so the fact that it made it into stores is repulsive. I will never buy anything from this company and will tell as many people as I can as well not to.
1.0,Cross-contaminated!!!,"I used to sell these cookies in my health food store.  Several years ago my celiac and gluten sensitive customers began complaining that they had reacted to these cookies.  I read the back of the box,(you should always read the back of the box) where it stated that these cookies were made on equipment also used to process wheat.  I also found that in order to make these cookies more price competitive, the manufacturer added soy flour to the recipe.  I would suggest to anyone who is celiac to look for another brand that is made in dedicated wheat free facility."
5.0,the best and easiest by far!,this product is great.  it is so easy to use.  it disolves instantly.  no chasing a cube around in a cup of water!  the little packets take little storage space and it is great to take camping or in a luchbox for a hot cup of broth on a cold winter day.
1.0,Look Somewhere Else,"When bought the shipping was a Great surprise! Shipping was more than the Sauce. Contacted Merchant & they said they would cancel the order. (It doesn't take 29.00 to ground ship a gallon of Teriyaki Sauce!!!) I was happy they said they would cancel the entire order, however... it arrived 7 days later & my credit card was charged... I believe they enjoy just telling you what it is you want to hear & they will do what they want & keep the exorbitant Shipping rate as margin. Very disappointed & would suggest purchasing elsewhere. I did keep the gallon & the sauce is average in taste & is not as great as talked up... Again BEWARE of exorbitant shipping with this merchant..."
5.0,Better than Senseo pods,"I think Keurig is pushing out Senseo. The grocery stores near me stopped carrying Senseo pods. I went with this order based on the 3 positive reviews. They were right. Great cup of coffee. In fact, I think the coffee is better than what is in the Senseo pods. These pods are a little thicker, IMO, compared to the others but this means I can sneak another half cup of coffee out of the 2 pods. Would definitely reorder these again."
5.0,my very picky puppy loves these,I have been through so many treats for my puppy.  Trying to find something healthy that she actually likes has been a challenge.  But she loves these and she loves the Wellness Pure Rewards too.  My search is finally over.  And I love that they can be easily ripped into smaller pieces so I can use them in training without giving her too much at a time.
5.0,Very good and prompt service,I had a problem finding these sugar-free products locally for awhile and ordered them from Amazon.  The order was quick and I had no problems.  Thank you
1.0,Thin - Wattery - Not worth buying,"I have written MANY reviews of Amazon products. Most of them have been either 4 or 5 stars ... occasionally a 3. THIS IS MY FIRST ""ONE STAR"". I would have given it a zero if I could have. This stuff is JUNK.  Perhaps the other reviewers are correct ... and I just got a bad pair of bottles. But the ones I got were so diluted as to be nearly useless.  I plan to throw these in the trash as soon as my order of a better brand arrives from Amazon.  The ONLY plus I would give this outfit is that they are prompt in their delivery, but perhaps over zealous in the bubble wrap and tape department.  Fred Moore, Herndon, VA"
5.0,Tasty!,"These were very tasty, individually wrapped, sugar free gummy treats.  I recommend checking out the producer's website - www.diabeticfriendly.com for a boat load of sugar free snacks."
5.0,Great Tea!,I got this tea from a holistic health store and it had me feeling better the first day. Highly recommended for cold/fever relief. I am happy to see Amazon sells it in bulk because I want to send some to the family!
5.0,Maple sugar very good.,What I ordered was what I thought I would get and I was not disappointed.  Thank you for your promptness.
5.0,When you bite into a Crunchie,"It goes, mmmmmmm in your mouth. It also goes CRRRR in you mouth. It's delicious! The chocolate is not as sweet as Hershey's and does not have that odd waxy gritty feel Hershey's has. The honeycomb is delicate in the middle and will melt on your tongue, and is satisfyingly crunchy around the edges. This is one of my all time favourite chocolate bars, and I am thrilled to have found them on Amazon!"
1.0,"IT'S A SMALL, SMALL EAR","After researching ""roasted pig ears"" for my beloved dog, I chose this product...the package arrived in a timely manner; the bag was so small and lightweight I couldn't believe it contained my order...Unfortunately it did. I didn't bother to un-tie the hand-knotted bag but put the LIGHTWEIGHT package back into the box in which it arrived and will now return them...For the price paid, I could go to one of the local pet supply stores and purchase MORE than 24 ears...and also would have an ear large enough to satisfy my large mix-breed pet! These ears are SMALL...while they appear to be ears, not strips, they are ridiculously small and have no weight to them. Color me disappointed. I thought about ordering another brand but this experience has made me gun-shy...or ear-shy !! Poor product; cheaply packaged in thin hand-knotted plastic bag...No thanks. My dog--and my wallet--deserve better !!"
1.0,Diarrhea,We just bought a package for our lab.  The only thing in her diet that has changed was the one dentastix she consumed and the diarrhea I've had to clean of my carpet makes me very unhappy.  Our opinion is the dentastix caused it.  We won't be buying this again and would not recommend them to anyone.
1.0,"should be called ""candied strawberries""","I wantd to make the Barefoot Contessa's recipe for strawberry scones, which calls for dried strawberries.  Expecting to get something akin to dried cranberries or raisins, I was disappointed, these should be called candied strawberries since they hardly resembled fruit and were coated in sugar.  They were OK in the recipe, but I can't feel good about feeding these to my family.  Save your money (they are pricey!)and use craisins instead - or just go for chocolate."
1.0,Coffee Mate Creamer 50 oz,"I did not order, nor receive this product and do not understand why it's on my list of products to review.  I gave it one star only because I was not permitted to submit a review unless I checked at least one star.  I personally do not care for powdered creamers, and I am unable to give an honest opinion of this, or any other brand of powdered creamers."
1.0,Disappointed is not strong enough,"The product shipped me was so old the chocolate had turned white and was dry, cracked and tasted toooo nasty - returned items to shipper but have not received a refund.  First time I've been unhappy with a purchase from Amazon.  Ordered all three candy pkgs shown on Amazon - was unhappy with all of them as they were definitely rejected product but at least the other two with the Reese's products and Hershey bars were fresh - just misshapen or broken but taste was good. Will never order candy again from any of these folks."
1.0,A daily source of GI distress (cramping & flatulence),"I ate approximately 4 of these rather deceptively delicious bars through a one day period and had one of the worst episodes of cramping and gas in my life. And on top of that, I was at work, orchestrating a cacophony of trumpet piercing farts in the acoustically optimal office restroom. I had to sit on the toilet about 8 times that day and by the end of the night, the mucosa of my rectum was prolapsing out of my anus. It was burning down there as if I had an enema with a pint of Tabasco sauce. If you insist on eating these, be sure you are alone and at home."
1.0,the price is up!!!,I bought this kind of dark chocolate bar on February. The price was $16.60 . The price is up to $30.00.
1.0,EWWW,"I like green tea but this is overly sweet, artificial tasting too and it has little pieces of what I am guessing is aloe vera, YUK. This is not really a healthy drink either, it has too much sugar which makes the drink too sweet, and from the label it appears to be watered down tea? I don't like it and it is definitely not worth paying the price. I wouldn't buy this if it was going for a quarter."
5.0,Delicious and healthy,"This cereal is *really* tasty - sort of like an apple-mild-cinnamon flavor.  Very healthy, too, and good for people with many allergies; check out the ingredients. You can buy it on sale at Kroger for $2.50/box when it's on sale."
5.0,Tasty!,These dried apples are great for snacking right out of the bag or used to make our own homemade cereal! They're a great healthy treat!
1.0,Made in China,Be aware that these treats are made in China. We received the mini twistz as a Christmas gift for our dogs and one of our dogs started having petit mal seizures about once a week after Christmas. We couldn't figure out what was going on but when a friend pointed out that these treats were from China we tossed them real fast and sure enough the seizures have stopped. Of course I can't prove that the seizures were caused from these treats but I can't help think there's a connection.
5.0,The best!,"This is the only cocoa I use for homemade hot chocolate.  I've tried others, but always go back to Droste - fast."
5.0,Economic Natural Deodorizer,"It works well even beyond the refrigerator and freezer. It's easy to use and is cheap. I highly recommend it because it's better and more cost effective then the ritzy, cutesy fresheners."
5.0,Puffed Rice Cereal,I compared prices at my local grocery store and I ended up saving quite a bit of money! Thanks Amazon!!
5.0,Delicious!,"Delicious, healthy beans with BPA free lining.  I highly recommend them!  Wish more companies were as responsible as Eden Organic."
5.0,Candy in a bag,I bought this for My little brother for his 13th Birthday gift and he told Me I was his coolest sister & he loved all the candy that came with it
1.0,Gross,These coffee beans taste and smell really terrible. I've had other cherry flavored coffees that were much better. it came with two bags. I threw them both away. Total waste of money.
5.0,practical party favor,"I got this at a Mother's Day Tea and I love it.  It fits in my purse and I've used it to measure furniture, windows and luggage.  I hope it becomes available again as I would like to buy it for a party I'm giving."
1.0,Banana Nut Bread,I received the Banana Nut Bread soft baked bar in my Influenster Summer Beauty VoxBox and I wasn't that big of a fan of it. I personally do not care for bananas to begin with so I knew that the chances of me liking it would be slim. My mom loved it though.
1.0,Not very good,"Not tasty Not spicy Just some bland mix of vegetables, you can make something better at home even if you are new to using the stove. Try Jyoti brand, i have to try it yet but based on reviews it should be better  EDIT:  Tried ""Jyoti"" and ""Truly Indian"" brands of Grocery and Gourmet Food. Exceptionally better stuff compared to this trash Tasty Bite  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_grocery?_encoding=UTF8&node=16310101&field-brandtextbin=Truly%20Indian http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=bl_sr_grocery?_encoding=UTF8&node=16310101&field-brandtextbin=Jyoti"
1.0,1 box,"Product description says 2 boxes, only received one.  This is a huge ripoff, I paid $10 for one box of 5 bars yet they are counted as 10.  How do I go about getting my other box?"
5.0,Flavored coffee k-cups,Great item at a great price.  Less blueberry would have been great.  All the other flavors were great.  Thanks for a great time with COFFEE !!!
1.0,TASTES MEDICINAL NOT MEDITERRANEAN!,"I love quinoa, so I was excited to try these flavored Roland Quinoa mixes for quick, easy side dishes.  I bought 3 varieties and tried the Mediterranean last night.  I was so disappointed!  It had a peculiar, almost medicinal taste. It was inedible. I hope the Black Bean and the Garlic flavors are a lot better. . ."
5.0,Bye Bye Flakes,My hair is very dry and living in the desert does not help.  Every summer I start to see flakes which you can see from a mile away.  I currently use Anthonys shampoo in the green tea for dry hair.  My current shampoo never helps so my hopes were low for the Clear Men. After one use pf Clear Men the dandruff was done and it has not returned.  The shampoo has a very strong green tea smell and the shampoo itself is thicker than my normal shampoo which creates alot of suds when you apply.  This is a great Anti Dandruff Shampoo and works better than expected.
5.0,Very Pleasing and quick,Made this and chapati one Saturday night for guest.  The loved it!  The finished the curry sauce with a bosten butt I made for BBQ.  I almost think pulled pork cooked in this instant curry mix is better then chicken.  Wife had me make a second batch on Sunday.
5.0,Excellent Tea,My wife is Chinese and drinks this every day. She prefers the loose leaf type and this tea comes in a mylar type sealed bag inside the box. This keeps it very fresh until it's time to open a new box. The flavor is a mild traditional green tea.
5.0,Best price for organic pouched pears,"If you need the convenience of this kind of pouch packaging (lightweight, not breakable glass) for ""on the go"" situations, the Amazon price for these is the best anywhere.  Less than $1 per 3.5 oz pouch.  At the time I'm writing this review, the per ounce price is less than Plum Organics, Ella's Kitchen and Sprouts.  I also prefer this packaging over Sprouts because you don't need a spoon to feed baby, just squeeze directly in the mouth.  However, if I'm feeding at home, the best bargain is with  Earth's Best Organic 2nd Pears, (6 months & up), 4 Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) .  Even if you don't do Subscribe and Save, it's a great deal, compared to the pouch style competitors."
5.0,"human quality ingredients, unique manufacturing process-- my cat loves it!","Blue Buffalo Spa Select is great! Top of the line ingredients, human food grade-- in addition to the indoor cat formula there's a chicken version and a fish version. This food meets a very high standard. No yucky meat ""by-products"", meat and meat meals are the top ingredients, plus a host of wholesome and varied ingredients and probiotics.  On top of that, this is an incredibly palatable food. My cat LOVES it. In fact, she scarfs it right down, when she typically has just grazed on a piece or two at a time of other premium foods. I have to be careful to use a measuring cup and not overfeed her, 'cause she will seek me out and meow for more!  Blue Buffalo uses a unique process to manufacture ""lifebits"" which are added to the food. These smaller, darker pieces are cold formed in order to maintain nutrients. I don't believe any other company incorporates this kind of element into cat or dog food.  I came across this cat food at the local Tractor Supply. I'd never heard or read about Blue Buffalo, but I respect what they are doing, and I've changed to Blue Buffalo dog food for my golden retrievers, too.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Here's a summary of the nutritional information: -Recommended daily feeding chart-- amount varies based on age, activity level, breed, and environement, but in general a 5-9 pound cat will eat 1/4-1/2 cup, while a 10-14 pound cat will eat 1/2-1 cup. -One cup contains 478 calories -Major ingredients: Deboned chicken, chicken meal, whole ground barley, fish meal, oatmeal, whole ground brown rice, whole potatoes, chicken fat (preserved with natural mixed tocopherols), natural chicken flavor, dried egg, dried cellulose, whole sweet potatoes, whole carrots, cranberries, blueberries, flaxseed (natural soource of Omega 6 fatty acids), barley grass, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, kelp meal, taurine, l-carnitine, l-lysine, ycca schidigera, green tea extract, turmeric, salmon oil (natural source of Omega 3 fatty acids), black malted barley, dried chicory root, fructooligosaccarides, oil of rosemary, the expected vitamins and minerals, and several probiotics (lactobacillus acidolphilus, bacillus subtilis, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bifidobacgterium longum, enterococcus faecium).  I hope this helps you evaluate whether or not this food is a good match for your feline friend.  My cat and I have been really happy with it."
5.0,Glutino Gluten Free Cheddar Crackers,If you have to have Gluten Free products this is a great one.  I love them and my whole family cannot tell they are anything but a good cracker.  Good price also.  The Cheddar ones are the best the plain I don't care for.
1.0,An Epic Disappointment,"I read about the taste of Skyline chili on a Tulsa, OK website [..], posted by someone trying to simulate the unique taste of cheese coneys made by the Tulsa, OK-based Coney Islander hot dog restaurant chain.  A transplanted Tulsa native that's lived in New York City since 1977, I was suddenly overpowered by the urge to recreate the mythic hot dogs of my teenage youth, so I immediately ordered a case of six 15-ounce cans.  Amazon promptly delivered the chili and I eagerly set about sampling it. Unfortunately the chili turned out to be (no disrespect intended to Skyline fans in Cincinnati and elsewhere) inedible--at least to my taste buds--and looking nothing like the product depicted on the can wrapper. The contents consisted of half watery soup, half highly spiced meat, and resembling nothing like the savory, meaty chili described by the website writer. Even after pouring off all the liquid, the remaining chili was so heavily spiced with I believe to be a heavy dose of cloves and perhaps some cinnamon and other ingredients that I stopped eating after a single bite.  Still, wanting to believe that I could somehow employ this chili to help mimic the taste of my beloved Coney Islander cheese dogs, I asked my wife to sample the chili, who proclaimed it to be ""awful.""  Much as I hate to step on a product that some people no doubt love, I have to say this is the absolute worst canned chili I've ever eaten. It was so bad I felt slightly nauseated a few minutes after having the single bite, and a faint worry about food poisoning briefly entered my mind.  Needless to say, the five other cans were summarily tossed into the garbage. The quest to find the perfect chili for hot dogs continues..."
1.0,This Mocktail doesn't cut it,"After having previously tried the  Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4) ,  I had high hopes this would be equally refreshing.  Sadly it was not the case, it has a nasty aftertaste  Maybe like a real Margarita it requires salt around the edge of the glass."
5.0,Great Tea especially before bed,"This is a classic from South Africa and I'm from the same place so it's not new to me.  This tastes like Rooibos should taste.  The picture shows a brown paper bag.  Mine arrived in a high tech foil pouch with a brown paper exterior.  Which after you cut off the seal has a zip lock top. No need to find another container as one reviewer suggested now that the packing is improved.  I sleep best when I drink Rooibos before going to bed.  I like drinking it all day.  It's good for you and caffeine free.  I drink it with milk or Almond milk.  The history of Rooibis is it was developed as a tea substitute in South Africa due to the expense of importing tea in the 1700's and 1800's.  It's not a true tea and what's in the bag is a lot finer than a traditional loose leaf tea.  Until it expands from hot water a few of the tiny leaves will slip through most brewing devices.  The leaf size is just a FYI, not a problem for me.  With the free shipping from Amazon this is probably the best Rooibos bargain in the USA.  For the true South African experience you need to dunk Beskuit (pr. Bess-kate) a Biscotti like rusk in your Rooibos tea.  Amazon carries ""Ouma Rusks"" the number one brand of Beskuit in South Africa or just Google the recipe, I bake my own.  Being that this product is from South Africa UPS decided to send my Prime 2nd day air order via Timbuktu, but I won't knock the product for UPS's incompetence."
5.0,"Yum, professional baker","I am a ""PJ baker"" I run a small bakery form my home, I love this product especially for key lime pies. taste like the realu thing and a lot easier than squeezing limes."
5.0,BEST CRACKER INN THE WORLD,Just my opinion but these are the greatest with there light taste and crispness. I do reccomend that you request extra packing as these are fragile. There are none better.
1.0,Is this really organic?,Please note the photo and description of the product does not indicate that the apricots are really organic.  The only reference to organic is in the title of the item.
5.0,Their current best flavor,"This is awesome, awesome tea.  Does not taste like coffee - though I can see how it has a sort of grain-based civil-war coffee stand in appeal to it.  My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea was Almond Sunset which they discontinued - it was AWESOME.  This tastes someone what Almond Sunset, but without the amaretto tones.  I am scared they will discontinue this, though my husband is convinced that will never happen.  I think I may buy a few cases just in case.  If you loved Almond Sunset, you will like this tea."
1.0,ALL I GOT WAS TINY PIECES!,"You see the picture of this? Well, what I got were tiny dried up odds and ends. I don't know if this is normal for this product, but I expected them to be like the picture. It had way too much sugar, probably because the pieces were so small. They were not nice and square, they were much smaller and mostly triangle, and nugget shaped. I bought them mainly to use with some red onions and cook them with steak. But it would probably be too sweet, as small and sugary as they are.  UPDATE: I emailed the seller and they told me they switched companies and the new company was not selling the squuares pictured on the bag and that is why they were smaller. I don't know. But they refunded me. Good company to deal with, anyway."
5.0,Best tasting broth for vegetarians,"My wife is a vegetarian and finding products that taste good to both of us is a challenge.  After finding Osem consomme products at a local Safeway, we were both hooked.  It is the next best thing to the real meat broths in flavor we have ever found.  I am glad Amazon carries these in bulk packs at a good price."
5.0,Diamond Walnuts,"Diamond walnuts - great- and if you heat them up for about 2 minutes it brings out the oils and enhances the flavor, add them to oatmeal and it adds a little crunch."
5.0,Worth a try!,"I feel my milk supply increased within 24 hours. I have loose bowel movement on the first day of taking Fenugreek Seed pills, but it help my constipation.  I was nursing my daughter almost by the hour in the first month, and it's necessary to establish milk supply. With help of this pill now I can breastfeed my 2-month-old without supplement. No more bottle washing. Save time; save money. Lose weight without diet and exercise. It's been great."
1.0,awful taste," Kraft Italian Salad Dressing, Fat Free, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 60)   Big mistake, I am stuck with 59 packets of these horrible tasting salad dressings.  Kraft has a decent rep when it comes to items like this but they really missed the mark when they produced this item.  Horrible very salty taste perhaps because it is lite dressing, although I have tried other Kraft lite salad dressings and they were not bad. Does anyone want to buy 59 packets of italian dressing?  I will more then likely wind up throwing these out unless someone in my family decides to try them and likes them."
5.0,So much yummier than the original!,"I remember that the old animal crackers used to be a lot thicker, pastier, and dryer. These ones are different from those ones that often come in the big plastic containers. These have a yummy ingredient that I can't quite put my hand on...almost like cinnamon and they are sooo yummy. I can just keep eating and eating it. I didn't get them off Amazon so I can't comment on the freshness of those or anything but the actual food is very tasty. I just HAD to write a review! I'd definitely recommend them! :P"
5.0,Listed for dogs loved by cats,"I know this product is listed for dogs but my cats love it.  They are not beggars but when we have smoked salmon out they go nuts and this is the next best thing.  Even my shy boy who does not usually take treats goes for it.  I am not a pet food expert but this looks like it is  basically just dried salmon and has to be good for them. Great product, reasonable quantity for the price. One warning - it does smell like salmon and is a bit chewy.  My cats are large and like chewing on it.  Little cats might find it tough.  I will definitely re-order"
1.0,Hot mess,"These swiss miss k cups don't really work, there is at least 1/3 of the chocolate powder left in the k cup. I tried tapping the cup to get things stirred up before placing it in the machine, no luck. The hot chocolate is weak even on the smallest setting. It also has a bit of an aftertaste. I'll keep looking, this one is not a keeper."
5.0,I just got mine and I am so excited!,"It smelled great in the jar. I used it immediately on my pregnant belly, thighs, eyes, and a dry patch under my mouth. I also heated up a tiny bit (a little goes a long way) in the microwave to apply to my hair and ends to freshen up my 3rd day flexi rod set. I can just tell this is my new beauty staple! My cat tried to eat some too and that just goes to show because my smart fat kitty would never try to eat any hair product, but he knew this baby was naturally edible lol."
5.0,Best cup of coffee I ever had!,Absolutely the best cup of flavored coffee I've ever had! And the aroma! My house never smelled so good. I'm putting it on a subscribe and safe auto delivery! Yummmm!!!
5.0,SunMaid Chopped Dates,"This product is excellent for baking, and its size is convenient, as well.  (I use in oatmeal cookies, trail mix, etc., etc)."
1.0,New Stevia sweetener is terrible,"The new Stevia sweetener ruined this, formerly my favorite drink by far. Cannot choke this new stuff down. I won't be buying it anymore until they change back to the old formula."
5.0,Chocolate Lucky Charms,This cereal is extremely hard to find. They are gluten free and delicious!Chocolate Lucky Charms are worth getting for yourself.
1.0,davidsons bulk tea decaf french vanilla 16 oz bag,"I love french vanilla tea, but this was absolutelt the worst taste, I usually drink 5-6 or more cups of hot tea a day, and this will not be one of them."
5.0,It works...,"I don't do a lot of reviews, but I just had to say that this stuff works for me.  From traveling long distances on boring highways to staying clear in the head while writing a book to reading boring stuff, it just keeps me engaged in the activity at hand.  It seems to get me past the big lunch sleepy-time that follows...  Give it a try.  (I have no financial interest in your doing so... except that it keeps the product in production so I can get more when I want to! :)  Keep smiling, Ron"
1.0,Bergin Nut Company Almonds arrived stale.,These arrived today.  They are stale and chewy.  There is practically no flavor.  I am soooo disappointed!
5.0,An unusual flavor combination.,"I love cashews, and I love black pepper flavored potato chips, so when I saw these, I knew I had to try them.  At first taste, I wasn't sure what to make of them.  The pepper taste was strong, almost overpowering the cashew flavor.  But I soon found myself enjoying the flavor, even craving them.  This is certainly not a flavor for everyone, but if you prefer savory flavors to some of the sweeter nut varieties out there, give these a try.  And I have to once again comment that I love the canister these come in.  They fit well in a car cup-holder, and I can just pop the canister in my messenger for a between-class snack, without worrying that the container will pop open, scattering nuts everywhere."
1.0,Horrible. Just Horrible clam chowder.,"Campbells Chunky ""Healthy request"" Clam Chowder tastes horrible. It's that simple. I wouldn't eat it again if it was free, really, I wouldnt. Only thing that could save this chowder is if you added at least a Tsp or two. of salt. about a 1/4 c of heavy cream, at least 2 TBSP of butter and a 6 oz can of clams to the 18.8oz can, as this stuff is all but devoid of those three things. If you like watery, bland potato soup, this stuff is for you!  My suggestion: Just get the real stuff, but eat less of it and you get the same calories. At least you will enjoy each bite rather than cringe and after the 3rd bite throw it out. Maybe that is their plan. Make food so bad you just throw it out and lose weight from starvation. Way to go Campbells!"
1.0,BLOOD EVERYWHERE!  BEWARE - NOT SAFE!!!!!,"I was in the same room with my schnauzer when he suddenly went nuts and there was blood everywhere!  the middle insert came out and he got his teeth caught in the cube trying to get to the food.  NOT SAFE!  he was hitting everything in his path and it took a few minutes to calm him enough to lower his head and get his teeth out of it.  We won't use THAT again EVER  It is also VERY difficult to put the food into, you need good finger dexterity to accomplish that feat.  This was truly a waste of money.  This deserves a ZERO star."
1.0,"disappointing, the gum seemed old and stale","I have purchased this same spry gum at the local health food store and love it.  I saw it on amazon and free super saver shipping.  The price was good and it seemed like a good deal.  Once I tasted the gum I knew something was wrong.  It seemed stale or old.  The expiration date was fine .... not bad until 2013 so then why.  I don't know if the shipping conditions were bad and exposed to heat or cold, but I will not be buying this from amazon again."
1.0,STALE AND DISAPPOINTED.....,"This item arrived to me STALE! I was very, very, very DISAPPOINTED. I will not be buying this item again."
5.0,wonderful,"This coconut oil is fantastic - high quality, and it smells really great.  Amazon had the best prices for anything similar, and we will definitely get this again."
5.0,I'm a Steaz lover.,I buy them by the case because they are completely free of artificial stuff AND sugar which is very hard to find in an energy drink.  I think they taste fine - not as good as a milkshake - but not much different from plain red bull to me.  The energy boost is mild a long-lasting.
1.0,Tastes Like Chalk,"I had rather high hopes for these, but they taste truly awful. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it -- though I did manage to get through several of the color changes. My wife described them as tasting like chalk and didn't get as far through hers as I did before pitching it.  If you're hoping for something like a giant Wonka's Gobstopper (as I was), don't get these. In fact, unless you like slightly sweetened chalk, don't get these."
1.0,Like a mouthful of pepper,"The product description currently states that these nuts have ""a hint of pepper.""  Don't you believe it.  There's at least as much pepper on these as there is salt, and there's too much of both.  I can't taste anything but the pepper when I eat them, and they're so salty that I'm thirsty afterwards.  This is a terrible product, and the company needs to seriously scale back their seasonings."
1.0,My review on this *cough* *hack* oh sorry,"put one in your mouth and you'll understand,they're bad. And not just BAD,they're the baddest of the baddest. A black hole of taste.  I just want to say that *cough* *cough* *hack* that they're really... *cough* oh forget it!"
5.0,Hosanna Praise & Worship Collection,"Second special praise and worship collection focused on God-centered spiritual warfare.  Long Play with lyrics.  Leaders: Bob Fitts, Bob Kauflin, Kent Henry, Mark Conner, Ron Kenoly, Don Moen, Rusty Nelson, Randy Rothwell.

1.0,Upsetting,"Who decided walden farms should sell this product? It's so terrible. The fact they still sell this should be a crime.  Tastes like a packet of splenda mixed with mystery chemicals. Why does it have to be that sweet? It's like they didn't even taste test before this was put on the market. Was this a joke on the consumer or what? I mean it is THAT bad. I told myself I'd eat it because I hate throwing food away, but even opening the jar makes me gag when that awful smell hits my nostrils. What a waste of money. I bought mine at the store, not through amazon, but seeing the other reviews on here, it's going to be terrible either way. I don't normally complain about food but man, this is the worst thing I have ever eaten. I hope there are better alternatives to peanut butter out there than this."
5.0,Must be this brand.,"Once again, I have tried other brands for this and like my english breakfast this one is more bold and tastes right. This is the one youll want to buy!"
1.0,Don't buy the Sobe Mango Mandrian coconut flavor,Save yourself the money do NOT buy the Sobe Lifewater  Mango mandrian w/ coconut flavor- GAG. Not that I know what a smelly arm pit tastes like but it would have to be very similar to this distgusting Sobe flavor.
5.0,Smooth & flavorful,"This coffee is delicious.  It's smooth and flavorful, not bitter.  I do have trouble finding tasty decaf, but I am enjoying this very much.  It is so important to wildlife to buy shade grown, not to mention organic, so I will definitely reorder.  I also consider the price to be quite competitive."
1.0,not fresh,"I returned these because the expiration date was the day I received them.  They were quite expensive but I was willing to pay the price because these are not always available in the local stores. I want to order again but am afraid I might get the same shipment date. If Amazon can check the exp. date before they sent them out, I would order again."
5.0,Gatorade,This was on my son's wish list and was sent to Afghanistan as part of his care package. Response time was good and product arrived in good shape.
5.0,Can't go back to old brand.,I will NOT go back to regular hot cocoa mix.  This is heavenly.  Worth the price.  Buy it and indulge.  ymmmmm.
5.0,Kitty Loves,A fairly expensive item but kitty loves it. Ofcourse plain old kitten food does not taste good after eating these treats.
1.0,"Made me sick, JUNK",I tried this product because of good reviews.It makes me ill and tastes extremely BAD. I just found out a company can be hired to send lots of positive feedback for a fee. This is a very poor product.Garbage compared to superpump 250.
1.0,No Smell,"I purchased this lavender for the fragrance to remind me of the south of France. The product arrived yesterday and there is little or no fragrance. The bag is labeled ""culinary lavender"".  The product is not listed as culinary lavendar on the web page and it was reported to be great for making sachets - no way!  This was a total waste of money."
1.0,Vicks Vapor Rub,"I'm really curious as to what ""blended black tea"", means. It doesn't say it on the ingredients list, but it smells and tastes just like menthol, camphor and eucalyptus oil, with a nice blend of cinnamon, which it does list. In removing it from the wrapper, it had such a strong aroma of Vick's Vapor Rub, that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink. However, I did want to try it, so here I am, alive and still kicking. The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth, and the packaging is easy on the eyes. Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though, in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage. The ingredients are: blended black tea, ginger root, cinnamon, cinnamon oil, clove oil, allspice, nutemeg, clove, and cardamon oil. Because of the unknown element, I wouldn't be surprised if they started marketing it, as a familiar cold remedy. Todd Wilbur?...you missed one."
5.0,Great Item! Stock up now!,This sweetened Kool-Aid drink mix is great because having the sugar already added makes sure that no one will add too much sugar.  The taste is just as wonderful as the regular Kool-Aid.  Being able to save using the Subscribe & Save program was also a HUGE plus.  I actually sent an order to a college student as a gift.  They love to get care packages in the mail.  Amazon makes sending plenty of care packages easy with these excellent deals!
5.0,Coffee,"Tried this coffee. Loved it, so now we have it auto-shipped. The ""Jamaican Me Crazy"" flavor is just absolutely wonderful. We get both regular and decaf shipped to us as we mix them to lessen our caffeine intake. Great product. Would recommend to anyone who loves their flavored coffee!"
1.0,"the ""GAG ME"" diet","Do not buy these!!!! And if you think you can ignore all the negative reviews, just because you so sorely wanted a pasta substitute, you'll be extremely disappointed. What's amazing is that even many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers admit to the things tasting horrible. But still, because they're labeled as 'noodles', some people will maintain a willingness to force them down.....such is the lure  of Pasta!  I suppose you could freeze fecal matter and sell it as ice cream and  some people would choose  to eat it if they desperately craved ice cream and wanted to believe the packaging.  These are shaped like noodles. All resemblance to any type of real noodle ends there.  Horrible smell....as noted here,gags many people.Smells like a fish that rotted in a beaker of benzene Horrible texture....like a scary foreign body in your food. No flavor (beyond the obnoxious smell) They don't really absorb any flavor either. The sauce just coats the outside, and in eating, any  sauce  quickly departs the  noodle surface and you're left with this disgusting mass of  slimy rubber  worms in your mouth. Even well rinsed, the weird fishy smell remains in your olfactory memory throughout the meal, thereby  eliciting a constant, low order,  gag reflex as you try to chew these things.  Somehow I pushed the order button twice...so I'll be throwing out $60 worth of 'food',. Not sure I want them in my garbage can. I may have to drive them straight to the local land fill. I didn't expect greatness from a zero calorie noodle, but I really hoped these things would  at least be a palatable substitute.....not even close.  Proving again; there's no such thing as a free lunch."
1.0,Bad Reaction from my cats,"I like natural products...gave some of this to my 3 cats.  They all liked the taste.  One threw it up (and continued to throw up) and the other had diarrhea (horrific smell) from it.  The third might of had diarrhea as well but I'm not sure.  It happened twice but I hadn't linked it to the treat yet.  I stopped giving it to them and then started again.  It happened again...both the vomit from one cat and diarrhea from the other.  It was a definitive smell and I know for sure it was the product.  In defense, my cats have sensitive systems and the one that vomits also tends to vomit greenies...she does keep down straight meat like canned tuna...cats are carnivores (more so than dogs) and do best strictly on meat.  However, the smell and level of reaction from my cats from this product was not like anything else they have tried."
1.0,"I hate to rain on anyones parade, but...","The starfish included in this little gift is very likely not sustainably harvested. In fact just the opposite. Anyone who cares about the ocean or the environment should not buy this. OTOH, the idea of a bromeliad in a little crystal hanger is a lovely idea, and there are several other great products very similar to this, without the environmental consequences.  What nice is that a bromeliad requires very little care, so even those with a black thumb can likely keep one for quite some time, thus making for a lasting gift.  So, yes, a gift like this one is a good idea. Just not this particular version. Please."
5.0,***Miraculous!***,"Before trying this miraculous product, I had been happily nursing my second daughter for 9 months with no problems.  Then I got my first postpartum period and my milk supply was down to almost nothing.  My daughter was miserable, biting me and crying at every nursing session and quickly ended up constipated.  For a week I was nursing constantly, pumping and drinking over a gallon of water a day to increase my supply, with increased frustration being the only result.  I was devastated and my daughter refused formula in bottles and sippy cups except when she was asleep.  I knew I had to either wean or find a miracle!   I googled my issue and learned about a few products that could possibly help.  I can't swallow pills so fenugreek wasn't an option but this tea sounded totally doable.  I ordered the pack of 6 with overnight shipping for only an extra $3.99 with my Amazon Prime benefits.   To brew the tea, I pour 8oz. of boiled water over the tea bag and cover the cup with a saucer and let it sit for a minimum of 10 minutes.  Then I dunk the tea bag 15 or so times and then gently squeeze it to extract every last bit.  When I tried my first cup, I hated it.  It tasted like musty, minty licorice.  I have a sensitive stomach so I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink it.  Adding honey didn't help but just a bit of sugar made it taste okay.  My second cup was a little bit better and by the third cup, I genuinely liked the taste of it!  I drink 4 cups a day and now I actually crave it!   The first day of use I didn't notice any increase in my milk supply but I did smell a bit like maple syrup, which my husband actually likes.  When I woke up the next morning my breasts felt slightly fuller, but not much of a difference.  I again drank 4 cups that day, waking up the next morning with fuller breasts and enough milk to sustain my daughter's thirst.  And the next morning?  I woke up practically engorged! I have been enjoying 4 cups of this miraculous, soothing product everyday for almost 2 weeks now and my daughter and I are both so thrilled and grateful.  Nursing is peaceful once again!"
1.0,"misslabeled, terrible customer support","I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same."
1.0,Horrible price,You can do better buying these drinks at the store. This is a terrible deal. They are 2.39 at gas stations.
1.0,"Disgusting, yuck, no thanks!","Disgusting, yuck, no thanks! The first three words I thought of after biting into one of these chocolate fruit tragedies. Buy something else, these are terrible."
1.0,The smell was horrible...threw the whole bottle away!!!,This hair oil had a very offending odor....so much so that it made me sick to my stomach...I threw the whole bottle away!!!
1.0,Oily crap,Tried this geeky crap and threw it out. Bad flavor.  What w waste of money. Get the clear Stevia. It tastes better and is not greasy
5.0,Great Tea,This is my favorite tea.  No artificial anything.  It tastes like down home sweet tea from the old days. My favorite on a hot summer day.
1.0,STALE!,"These are so hard they break apart when you bite into them, not chewy at all!  This has to be the stalest batch of sour belts I have ever seen in my life.  I could use them for drum sticks!"
1.0,Cadet Beef Tendons Canine Treats Not as Depicted!!,"First, I waited for over two weeks to get what appeared to be a good alternative to the chicken sticks that my Shih Tzus love. Imagine my disgust when I opened the box of Cadet Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats and found black bugs in the bag and in the packing box. In addition, the Cadet treats are not as depicted in the picture. I expected sticks, not these humongous strips, fit for a Great Dane. I immediately dumped the whole box into the trash, called Amazon, who were very apologetic and immediately refunded my purchase. Thank you, Amazon!  But shame on Cadet! I am boycotting all of their products and will never buy another item from them, ever!!! The lesson for me is read the customer reviews.  Had I done so, I would have avoided the whole horrible experience and I wouldn't be making chicken strips for my Shih Tzus right now.  Cadet 1-Pound Bag 100-Percent Natural Beef Tendons Canine Treats "
1.0,RIDICULOUS! DON'T BUY THIS....,"I also only received a single package. I'm not sure who the idiot was that packed these boxes but come on - are you kidding me. When they ship granola bars - they ship 12 boxes and call it a 12 pack - they don't ship 12 individual granola bars! Also note that the ship weight is 10.2 lbs - Duh! Obviously, one package does not weigh 10.2 lbs! Amazon - fix this problem!!!!"
1.0,terrible pasta,What a disappointment ! They taste terrible and the texture is discusting. I would not ruin a good dish by adding them. I will never buy them again. Nasty !
5.0,Blessed Sleep,"I am one of those people that find it difficult to sleep after a particularly stressful day, and I would wake up around 3 am and my brain would go into gear, and I had to take naps just to make up my lack of sleep.  I tried this NeuroSleep and it only takes a half of a bottle at night, and within a half an hour I am dead to the world and I wake refreshed when I want to.  Worth every penny spent."
5.0,breakfast,"I have three grandchildren who love oatmeal for breakfast. Previously purchased a larger box of the original oatmeal, but they have eatten more of the variety pak than of the original. Love receiving it on a quarterly basis."
5.0,French vanilla cappuccino,"Loved this product, highly recommend it. If you like cappuccino you will love this. Also recommend the caramel flavor cappuccino also."
5.0,"Great product, easy preparation","We bought this product in the past to ship to our daughter, who lives in China. Refried beans is one food item from home that she craves from time to time.  She can buy tortillas at an import store, but not the refried beans. Cans are too expensive to ship, so a dehydrated product is the perfect solution.  Last time we bought a box to ship to her, we decided to taste the product ourselves.  We found that we agree with all the five-star ratings.  This stuff is good!  I was afraid that a dehydrated product would be finely powdered, and yield just pasty glop.  Much to my surprise, the product has good texture, comparable to canned refried beans.  This tastes much more like home-made beans than the canned version, however.  We will be buying more for us!  Great product."
1.0,Yuck,"After reading many reviews, I thought this would be a product worth trying, boy was I wrong. Not only did it taste disgusting and required a pinching of the nose for every sip, it didn't bring me any feelings of relaxation or stress relief. I even tried two tea bags and nothing. I followed all steeping and heating instructions and still nothing. It was gross and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."
1.0,Not good!,"This was definitely not worth the money or the shipping cost. The caviar was almost inedible as it was entirely too salty (yes I know its supposed to be salty, but not THIS salty). Spend your money elsewhere."
5.0,Great bribes and swimming treats for lil ones :),"Aside from being a nostalgicly great treat, they have no high-fructose corn syrup and are small enough for little hands.  We use these at our house for treats after helping clean up the playroom, and for rewards when working with our 1 and 3 year old in the swimming pool for swimming lessons.  The subscribe and save price is the best I've found - with 100 options to buy sweedish fish on amazon, this worked out the best for us.  The red flavor is the same it has been for years, and my personal favorite.  We tried the mixed flavors/colors, but they were just like other candy flavors, nothing special like the red ones :)  They arrived soft and fresh, with a far distant expiration date.  We are on our second box now, and appreciate the high quality.  Lu"
1.0,Mostly Peanuts,"I was led to believe that this Nut mix did not contain peanuts, when in fact it contains mostly peanuts."
5.0,The greatest cheese flavoring I've ever tried!!!,I tried the Whirley Pop Popcorn Zesty Cheddar Cheese Seasoning the same day I received it!  It was better than I had expected!  Much better!  Even tasted great sprinkled on some tortilla chips which made them taste just like Dorito's!!!  GREAT!  Will buy this product again!
5.0,Delicious,I bought these because they are so cute with Gumby and Pokey.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good tasting there.
1.0,Sorely Disappointed,I really enjoy Starbucks' pumpkin spice lattes and wanted to try to recreate it at home.  I looked around the reviews and settled on this one since everyone gave it 5 stars.  Know the candy hot tamales?  This syrup has the aftertaste of the candy's flavor profile.  More hot cinnamon than pumpkin flavor I'd say.  Also the safety cap on mine didn't work --the ring below the cap did not break when I twisted it off so I have no guarantee it was not opened before...
5.0,If you like Butter Beer from Universal Studios get this!,"I bought this product because I went to Universal Studios Orlando and tried Butter Beer which is sold in the Harry Potter section.  I didn't like the frozen Butter Beer that much but I loved the regular one.  I hunted online and found a recipe for it which included Vanilla Butternut(never heard of this before)and butterscotch flavoring, and cream soda. This recipe was on the mark and you don't need to use much of the flavorings."
1.0,How do you buy a 20 dollar gingerbread house?,"This is not a review of the quality of the product.  I just don't understand how anyone pays this much (even the on sale price) for a gingerbread house unless it is a dollhouse sized mansion with more candy than you buy for halloween.  Craft store, Wallmart, even the grocery store has these things.  If you are a family who doesn't eat the house, buy a post holiday house on sale and save it for next year, it lasts.  You can buy a Halloween house after that holiday and decorate it for christmas - cost 2 bucks.  Just saying."
1.0,I'd rather blend my own,"Why, oh why, can't I get straight Dutch processed cocoa? I bought this blend by accident (thought I was getting DP cocoa because of tricky labeling) and was severely disappointed. I use a lot of cocoa, and this blend is still sitting in my cupboard after 9 months. Time to search the internet for another company that sells DP cocoa. Attention Hershey's, in the meantime, what are we to do for recipes that use DP cocoa???  PS. This Hersheys blend tastes worse than than the two parts. IMHO DP and non-alkali cocoa should not be blended until just before using."
5.0,A Two-Fold Product That Works For Me,"Sometimes with an active lifestyle comes bad joints. I have arthritis in my knees and hips and get very little relief, if any, from all the diets and supplements I'm on. I'm far from crippled but the stiff painful joints is enough to make me feel and move like an old man at times. A guy at work recommended Black Cherry juice and I ignored him for quite a while since nothing else seemed to work - so why should this? Out of despair I picked some up at the grocery store and within 24 hours I felt much better. Not just much better but a lot better! I can't say this will work for everyone but over the last month I'm a new man. It's still hard to believe it's actually working.   As for ""Tart is Smart"" it saves me a lot of money by buying it through Amazon. It's concentrated and goes a long way. I use two bottles a month which gives me two 8 once glasses of cherry juice a day. I'd be spending three times as much in the grocery store. The taste isn't bad but as far as juices go it isn't my favorite. It's worth the health benefits though since I'm getting arthritic relief and boosting up my fruit consumption for the day."
5.0,"Sweet, salty, and savory!","My kids always want bourbon chicken when we go to food courts, so I decided to do some research on recipes and found this item (along with bourbon chicken marinade in the same line). This sauce didn't disappoint us; it tastes just like what we had at food courts.  For best flavor I do have an advice: Use the marinade sauce for a strong smokey flavor and save time, or charcoal grill your chicken AND throw in hickory chips. I love grilling and don't mind all the hassle, and the chicken turns out even better than the food court version."
5.0,Like the product.,"I am pleased with the Ken's Italian Dressing. I have been for years. I was vey disappointed that in order not to pay an outrageous shipping charge, I had to open a credit card account with Amazon."
1.0,AWFULL-DISAPPOINTED-MORE LIKE CRANBERRY,I emailed the following to Ocean Spray:  *Blueberry Juice Cocktail The new Blueberry Juice Coctail does NOT taste like Blueberry at ALL!! Your add & label are misleading.  This is more like cranberry juice with a splash of blueberry.  I don't like cranberry and I am extremely disappointed. Your tv ad should have the guys in the cranberries with a few blueberries - that's realistic.
1.0,very dry and hard to chew,sometimes it feels like chewing on paper..flavor is not very good either...will not recommend it again..
1.0,No Information,"This is the first time I would be using powdered Kelp and there is no information about this product on the packaging or on this website.  Ingredients--I expected to see 100% sea kelp, but it is not there.  I would like to know how to store this powder--refrigerate or not--not there.  Suggestions of how to use this product--not there.  I will continue to search elsewhere for this information, but this is not right for the company to not provide this information."
1.0,They ruined them.,"The first shipment we got was delicious.  The second and third was too.  Then with the fourth shipment I noticed they were crumblier and drier. The next shipment was dull in flavor.  I began realize they were taking out some of the molasses and most of the ginger, which are the main ingredients that make a ginger snap cookie.  Now it's like putting a half cup of  brown sugar in your mouth and good luck trying to swallow it.  Pathetic.  Never  buying again.  I'll find a way to make my own."
5.0,This stuff is great!!,"I have done so much research on coconut oil, because I've heard only good things about it. So I finally got it.My skin has never felt better and looked better, and it has only done wonderful things to my hair.Forget about all the expensive creams(they're all a scam) because coconut oil is all you need for you hair and skin issues.I would definitely buy this again, and recommend it to everyone.Thank you Nature's way coconut oil!"
5.0,Make a dark fruit cake,"I love old fashioned DARK fruit cake but now it seems all the modern fruit cake bakers are only producing LIGHT fruit cakes...I wondered what would happen if I added raisins, pecans, candied fruit and molasses to a box of Krusteaz Gingerbread Cake & Cookie Mix so I did and ended up with a great tasting dark fruit cake...I'm enjoying a piece right now...yum yum!!!"
1.0,"Died, in spite of best efforts","I bought this from Amazon (not the seller depicted currently). The plant looked great on arrival, but it died with 15 days, despite trying very hard and following all instructions. I wonder if shipping in a box (and depriving light, etc for 2-4 days) causes such damage."
5.0,NOT FROSTED IS BEST,"I have bought Blueberry Pop-Tarts from Amazon twice now.  This was my first purchase from AMAZON and I found it to be so easy to order from them.  My husband loves pop-tarts, but he doesn't like them frosted because that is too much sugar.  I can only find the strawberry in the stores, but his favorite is blueberry.  The closest store that come up on the internet that carried them was a mile from my home; however when I went to get them, there were none.  I asked to have a case held for me when they came in, and after three months, I figured I'd never get them.  The next store was 75 miles away.  So I tried Amazon.  Very easy shopping.  My husband is happy, and we share them with our son's family.  Hope they keep carrying the NOT FROSTED pastries."
1.0,Filters in the K-cups break!,"The filters in these K-Cups kept Breaking, almost every 3 cup in the box broke and dumped the grinds into the Coffee Cup. Then I got a run-a-round on how to complain or return the item. Combine it with the price increase on k-cups and it is no longer worth buying them on Amazon!"
5.0,A lifesaver!!,"THANK YOU to whoever invented this simple little item!! My cat now has to take thyroid medicine twice a day for the rest of her life, and there's NO FREAKIN WAY we would ever be able to give her pills any other way!! I tried to give her pills in treats, crushed up in food, shoving down her throat!! NOTHING worked. She freaked out as soon as she knew it was medication. She loves the chicken pockets and LIFE IS GOOD and it's so easy, she waits for her treat every day. She's doing so well and things couldn't be more purrfect!!! Happy in Massachusetts Sadie's Mom"
1.0,Peppers were very dry,The peppers were very dry because the oil came in the box and not in the jar. I would not purchase this item again.
1.0,gave me gas and diarrhea,"I bought 2 small bags of the Jelly Belly sugar free candy and about 2 hours after eating maybe, 20-25, jelly beans my stomach began to rumble and it became uncomfortable.  I called Jelly Belly and offered to scan and email the receipt for a refund and I was told they could not help me and that the receipt was not enough for a refund,that I had to have the bag itself.  I am disappointed in the company and will not make any additional purchases of any Jelly Belly products."
5.0,Mix it THIS WAY & NO Problems,"This powdered milk mixes easily with the water if you do it this way. Start off putting 1/3 of the water in measuring cup or container, add desired amount powdered milk & mix with a wire whisk to make a semi-thick paste. Gradually add the rest of the water while whisking, and you will have no lumps and delicious milk!"
5.0,Loving hot chocolate in Denver,"The first time I tasted this Mexican Spiced Ground Chocolate was in a restaurant in Southern Colorado. It was a cool rainy day and I was in love with it after the first sip.I have never tasted anything this good. I took down the name of the product, googled it, and quickly ordered it from Amazon. I will now be ready for the first snowy day in Denver. It is the best hot chocolate mix ever!!!"
1.0,Tastes like Lipton tea,"I tried several of the varities to pad my orders, including the Kona Coast Chai, Lahaina Spice and Hawaiian Breakfast.  Lahaina Spice is the best of the three, and it is between 2 and 3 stars. It is not real Chai tea, but a Hawaiian version of it.  If you need something to pad an order for Free Shipping, consider the Lahaina Spice. The other 2 varities taste like Lipton black tea."
1.0,Holy Creepy Crawlers and No Trapping,"Let me start by saying I don't normally write reviews and I buy almost everything via Amazon so I am compelled on this one. Ok so I have my nice flat panel tv mounted to a brick wall in the house we just moved into...over the course of the last two weeks noticed a big very very ugly silver fish coming out of the wood beam above the brick wall and running to the back of my TV. He or they continued this for the last two weeks. Fire up the Amazon prime and find the solution. Read one review that said this will only attract more silver fish, eggs, infestation and so on. The rest of the reviews were pretty solid. Got these boxes and declared war (placed 4 of them along the brick wall). Brewed a pot of coffee and ready to rock. First night nada. Tonight yes tonight (it's 2a.m. as I write this) I have just watched 5 different silver fish pay the wall a visit and hover near the boxes...so I am thinking sweet. The whole time I think they were laughing at me. They did not got any closer to the boxes and would not go in them. Then they returned to their beam. After about 5 hours of watching these horrible creatures laugh at these boxes I broke out the fly swatter and took care of these nasty guys. Sorry guys these boxes maybe drew out a larger problem that I have but caught nothing!!!!!  Sorry for the long review."
1.0,where's the french vanilla," Coffee-mate Coffee Creamer, French Vanilla Pump Bottle, 1.5L (Pack of 2)   One bottle lasted me over a month, and I am a coffee hound.  But, I believe they forgot to put the French Vanilla flavoring in the receipe, it tastes like regular coffee creamer, I was truly disappointed."
1.0,Not the same very disappointed Chihuahua,"These treats were my dogs favorite but the company has changed the formula Now, instead of duck wrap we have duck paint with some bits floating about. A rip off and misleading. My dog rejected this product and will not go near the treat."
1.0,Where's The Cardamon?  Prepare for the Cloveaload!,"If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you.  If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is ""this is NOT chai tea.""  There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea.  As it is, it should be called ""spicy clove tea.""  This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices.  It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves.  I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region.  Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors.  Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision.  I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically.  I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a ""traditional"" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand.  For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the ""chai"" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original."
1.0,Protein content too high... gave my dog acute renal failure.  RIP Ollie,"About 3 months ago I researched all the different foods and finally decided to purchase EVO because I thought it was what was best for my dog.  He is 3 1/2 and healthy (or at least he WAS until recently).  He has routine physicals including bloodwork for kidney problems so I didn't worry when I read that this food can cause problems with underlying kidney disease.  One day he began having diarrhea and refused to eat... I thought, no big deal dogs get tummy upsets once in awhile, right?  But he didnt get better.  His Belly and hind legs started to swell so much that the skin looked like it would tear...  multiple labs and fecals showed kidney disease of unknown cause.  He has had ultrasounds, multiple blood and urine cultures, a plasma transfusion and is now on multiple medications.  His BUN/CREAT has shot up and he now refuses to eat ANYTHING.  His entire diet consists of water, pills and whatever vitamin paste I can force him to take.  My heart is breaking for him...  I can't do anything and feel helpless.  If it goes on much longer without improving I will face the horrible decision of humane euthanization.  I feel that it was caused 100% from the high protein diet.  We can find NO other cause and he has no underlying kidney disease.  Please choose a different food and save the pain that my dog and I are going through right now. UPDATE>>> Not long after I made this review Ollie lost his battle to acute renal failure at the young age of 3.  No other underlying condition was found and my vet feels that the extremely high protein content in EVO is what shut his kidneys down.  RIP Ollie... :-("
1.0,Just Tea,"The description said the tea was ""Stimulating tea with a resonant, fruity aroma"". This tea could have passed for plain tea; there is little or no hint of black currant. We were disappointed."
1.0,Not the pick of the day.,"I have three cats and have been gradually moving their diets toward raw for their health. All of them have differing levels of finickiness, from an extremely fussy female to my male cat who will eat anything that doesn't eat him first. The first time I offered this to them, they all dove right in... and that was the last time they would touch it. I'm mystified. I've even tried mixing it in various amounts with their favorite canned foods and I end up having to throw it away.  Has anyone else had any luck integrating Prowl into their cats' diet? What works? I hate that I've wasted $30 on food they won't touch. That would buy quite a few cans of Core or EVO."
1.0,Not worth the money,"First, let me say how sorely disappointed I am with this mix.  Second, let me say I am an experienced baker and cook.  I desperately wanted this mix to work as I am currently enduring a maternal avoidance diet courtesey of my 8 month old's multiple, severe food allergies.  I cannot tell you how I looked forward to the day I tried this ""safe"" mix.  Unfortunately, I consider the money spent on this mix to be a total waste.  The two main problems with it are, in the following order:  1)  Gritty texture.  The grit is not horrible but it IS there and you cannot help but notice it.  For the amount of money charged per box of mix, they surely must be able to improve the texture of this product!  2)  Overwhelming vanilla.  The recipe calls for an excessive amount of vanilla, which leaves an almost sickening aftertaste to the cookies.  I triple checked the back of the box before pouring out the specified amount because it looked so off to me.  While the amount of vanilla IS something that can be tweaked at home, I feel it is inappropriate and unacceptable for the buyer of this product to have to make ANY changes to the recipe/ingredient ratios to produce a consistently pleasing, tasty cookie.  The whole concept of this mix, it seems to me, is to provide people with severely restricted diets a quick, easy, AND delicious treat that would otherwise have been made from scratch.  After my experience, I would rather cook from scratch every day for the rest of my life than make these again.  Hopefully someone at Cherrybrook looks at improving/refining this recipe...soon!"
1.0,The idiots at Tassimo strikes out again,"Ever since Kraft (makers of Tassimo) screwed up it's deal with Starbucks I (and apparently thousands of others like me) have been on a quest to find a decent replacement.  This is not it; not even close.  In fact, this is the worst t-disk coffee I've had so far.  Here's the problem: Some of the other disks out there make decent tasting coffee (Carte Noire Voluptuoso is pretty good)but they only produce a puny amount per disk. (the aforementioned brand takes 3! disks just to fill a regular sized coffee mug.)  Being fed-up with that, and seeing that these variety is advertised to make a LARGE size DARK ROAST, I figured I would give these a try.  It fills the cup alright, but the ""coffee"" more closely resembles hot brown water. Thin feeling in your mouth and hardly any flavor at all.  Noticing that the effluent from the Tassimo machine appears to be clear water for the last few seconds of the brewing process, I've even tried cutting it short.  That doesn't help either. The coffee just doesn't have any body to it.  It doesn't even have an aroma.  That's it Kraft.  You lost me.  I thought you could pull it together and reverse engineer something like the Starbucks coffee (or team up with another strong brand, or fix the contract, or something!) but I am tired of wasting my money while I wait.  You've proven to be the Keystone Cops of the coffee world. I am getting a K-cup machine for Christmas and never looking back."
1.0,"Organic beans wrapped in ""Bisphenol A"" lined cans","I went through the trouble to contact them and indeed they are using BPA lined cans. BPA is the same substance removed from plastic baby bottles, because it is rated dangerous. Many countries have already outlawed the use of BPA. To be fair it has to be said that more than 90% of all manufactures of canned products in the US use epoxies containing BPA Why can't an ""Organic"" manufacturer not go the extra mile? Buy Eden Food beans right here at Amazon. (...)"
1.0,TERRIBLE selection!,"I ordered this thinking I would get a variety of different teas. Here's what I got:  1 Celestial Seasonsings India spice chai 1 Bigelow Mint Medley 1 Bigelow Pomegranate Green Tea 2 Celestial Seasonsings Sleepytime herbal 2 Celestial Seasonsings Lemon zinger 3 Celestial Seasonsings English breakfast black 4 Celestial Seasonsings Mandarin orange 8 Celestial Seasonsings Green Tea  REALLY! 8 green teas. I will not order this again, in fact I am returning for a refund. The teas were not packaged well, they were just tossed into a paper bag."
1.0,leaks,"didn't leak for a month, now you shake it, it flings dressing all over the place.  a waste of money.  do not buy this.  move on."
1.0,crappy coffee,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but I wanted to save others the time and money.  This is crappy coffee; there is NO flavor.  It is almost as expensive as my usual mocha java blend from whole foods.  This stuff doesn't even stack up to folgers.  Have been adding extra coffee to try to compensate, but that doesn't help.  Whats worse, I can't even return this.  I could drink it, but I like to enjoy my coffee (not water with a hint of coffee flavoring)."
5.0,Yummy!,"I absolutely love this milk!! I can not begin my day with out drinking this! I love, love, love it!!"
5.0,Strawberry Jalepeno.Jam,"I first tasted this jam as a sample at a Christmas Bazaar. My family, friends, and I fell in love with it. I was unable to reach the local exhibitor and was thrilled to find Unbeatable Sales on Amazon.  I ordered on January 14th and was concerned it might not arrive in time for a party on the 28th. To my surprise, the package was delivered on Wednesday, January 18th. I'm thrilled!  Will order from them again. If you never tried this jam, I highly recommend it and Unbeatable Sales."
1.0,450 Calories per Oz -- not healthy,"Stay away from this product if you want to control your calorie intake, by taking supposedly healthier dried vegetable chips. Found the nutrition fact -- 450 calories per oz. It triples what you would find in other dried veggie chips."
1.0,Do you like lousy coffee?,"I ordered this thinking I was hopping on a GREAT DEAL! I mean $6.31 for 3 bags of coffee is awesome! Once I got it however, it was a different story. It smells bad, and tastes 10x worse! Yuck yuck yuck! Does NOT wake you up, gives sour stomach, tastes horrible! I will say, that I like strong coffee. My favorite coffee is organic Sumatra. This is worse than Folgers, and worse than Shop Rite brand (local grocer). Save yourself the misery!"
5.0,Great tasting decaf coffee,"This is a great tasting, smooth instant decaf coffee. You can decide how strong to make it by how much you add. Have a cup every night before bed!"
1.0,CAREFUL!!  SHIPPING COSTS MORE THAN COOKIES !!,"I suggest you be careful before ordering this item, I can not see that any cookie is worth $10.50 even if it tastes great! Even if we poor Celiac patients have to make do with much dry backed goods, and I mean some of it is dust-storm-dry, even so, I just can not justify to pay more for the shipping then for the cookies themselves. So make sure you always check the shipping charges before ordering anything, especially since cookies are not a food group, unfortunately. I have been in internet shopping and selling from its start and I know many sellers do try and make some extra income charging unreasonable rates for shipping by calling it HANDLING charges. This cookie bag weighs only 3.7 oz and I don't care how good you pack it this does not cost $5.05 for shipping. Did you know that a 1 oz letter costs $.44? I am sorry if I sound angry, but as a Celiac I am very much upset for being taken advantage of because I have a disease which makes me have to shop for special foods. And this is exactly what is going on here. By the time you have ordered from 4 to 6 sellers you end up paying enough for shipping that you could live off another month, and that is robbery. So I decided enough is enough and I am making sure you know about it before you go through quick check out(worst way to go!) or having to go back after having spent so much time online comparing prices just to find at checkout that you can't afford it because of such excess shipping charges."
1.0,Tastes like dog food,I am not a picky eater.  I love mayonnaise and I love bacon.  Naturally I had to buy this when I saw it.  After tasting I am baffled at how the company that makes it could have messed it up so bad.  It literally tastes what I imagine a bacon flavored dog snack would taste like.  I forced myself to try it on a turkey sandwich and could barely stomach it.  I can only imagine that any positive reviews are fake.
5.0,Delicious - will order again!!,"I love this granola, sweet and lots of cherries! More fruit than in most other granola. I love all the cherries!! This is my favorite granola cereal that I have tried. Highly recommend and will purchase again!"
5.0,Yum!,"If you like the taste of lemon, and you like tea, you'll probably like Bigelow's Lemon Lift blend. The tea is of good quality, sold for a reasonable price, and kept fresh by Bigelow's signature foil-wrapped packets. The lemon flavoring in Lemon Lift isn't quite as good as fresh-squeezed lemon, but it's certainly easier!"
1.0,Used to be good,"Used to really like these, but they've changed and are pretty nasty now - must be using lower quality shortening, and more of it.  Also, exceptionally high in trans-fats."
1.0,APPALLING price -- greedy,"I love this tea. I am disgusted by the appalling mark-up this seller has put on it. A one pound bag of this very same Mighty Leaf Organic Earl Grey, loose leaf, is available directly on their Mighty Leaf website for $24. I love shopping through Amazon; it is simple, and I (generally) feel secure that I'm getting competitive pricing from an array of reputable dealers. I often don't bother comparing to outside sources... in this case I'm glad I did!"
5.0,BeanBoozled,This product arrived very fast and perfectly new.  The kids had so much fun playing the game.  It is a birthday party they will never forget!
5.0,"Great dog food, unbeatable price.","Many dry grain free foods are good but few give great bang for your buck. Taste of the Wild certainly does. It ranks among the highest rated grain free dry dog food in the market and the price can't be beat. My lab loves it, and the kibbles are ideal for snack/treat size as well. I used to buy treats for training but these kibbles to the job... thus saving me more money. The 30lbs bag is work the purchase. I highly recommend it."
5.0,Amazon Pricing Police,These prices are outrageous! Complete robbery! Amazon should regulate their sellers. I demand the formation of an Amazon Pricing Police! (not kidding). I only give 5 stars for past memories of how delicious they were as a kid. At these prices I'm afraid I will not ever eat them again *sigh.
5.0,K-cup Sampler,"So I was hesitant to order this because of quite a few negative reviews, but I decided to anyway, and I'm glad I did! I searched through quite a few sampler packs before deciding on this one. Anybody who owns a Keurig knows that there are so many varieties of flavors out there, a sampler is really the only way to find one you know you will love. It came inside a brown paper bag inside the box, and inside the bag was 35 cups as promised. No duplicates at all which I was very happy about. 7 Decaf coffees, 3 Teas (Celestial Seasoning), 1 Hot Chocolate, and the rest were all flavors of coffee. Most were Green Mountain (which I have found makes damn good coffee) with a few Doughnut House, and a couple different brands (Gloria Jean, Black Tiger, and Jet Fuel) which I think will be interesting to try. Everything from Glazed Doughnut, to Extra Dark, to Mudslide in this assortment. Probably the best one I have seen yet, will def be getting it again since I love variety."
5.0,yummy,"soooooo many red vines. I'm in candy heaven and my family is also.  Buy this product, this candy arrived sooooo fresh and tasty, you will enjoy it too."
1.0,Bleck!!!,I'm afraid I have to agree with all the other negative reviews here. Maybe if I added my own Parmesan and butter to this sauce it would be at least tolerable. But if I have to do that then whats the point. I appreciate that Walden Farms is out there trying to give us some healthy alternatives. This one is a miss though. I use and enjoy some of their other products.
5.0,The Best Chai; and a Great Price,"I've pretty much tried all the bagged Chai tea commonly available and this is without a doubt my favorite.  I'm diabetic so I sweeten it with ""Splenda"", then add a small amount of Vanilla Soy Milk and the flavor and smells take one to a different world.  I'm buying this in ""bulk"" so I certainly don't expect high-quality packaging as some seem to think there should be. This is a huge savings over buying it retail at my grocery store and as I use at least three bags a day I am absolutely pleased to buy in bulk."
1.0,very disappointed,"Due to very poor packing, 7 of the 14 pouches I ordered broke and so I had to throw them out. They leaked everywhere - what a mess! I am very disappointed! What a waste of money!"
5.0,No Vapoorizer needed,This is great stuff. My dog gets the runs from time to time. Just zap the juicy pile and it comes right up. It also makes clean up a lot easier. Usually I wait till it ages a while before I chuck it in to my neighbors yard. Now I don't need to and my yard is nice and clean.
1.0,Tacky,"The absinthe glass and spoon are inferior quality, downright tacky, and too expensive based on similar products found elsewhere.  In addition, the provider does not respond when contacted for instructions to return the item.  DO NOT PURCHASE!"
5.0,I FOUND THE MISSING INGREDIENT AT LAST!!!!,"Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite.  I was able to find the recipe for the corn cakes in a cookbook I purchased, but I could never find the recipe for the Cancun.  I made several attempts to prepare our favorite dish, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't come close.  I finally just gave up, and then, a few weeks ago, I found the recipe on the internet. I was so excited, and made my grocery list for the ingredients that were needed.  Well, I found everything I needed, but you guessed it, the lobster base.  I went back on-line and did a search on lobster base. After checking out all the companies that popped-up, I decided on Amazon.com.  I found the amount and cost range I was looking for.  I placed my order and within a few days I received it.  I surprised my husband one night for dinner with our long-awaited favorite dish and when we took our first bites, we looked at each other and smiled.  That was it, the taste I thought was lost forever, had been found.  Thank you for giving me my missing ingredient......Better than Bouillon Lobster Base!!  Now I'm searching for more recipes that I can use it in.  Thank you, P. Bush"
1.0,Much weaker blend than the original,"We have been drinking the Good Earth original tea for many years but this recent repackaging has changed the tea for the worse. We barely get one 8 oz. cup of tea with a bag and it is weak tea. Very disappointed with the new tea which is a far cry from the ""original"" and should not be labeled as it is."
5.0,One of the Best Soda Drinks in the World,"My sister introduced me to Virgil's Black Cherry Cream Soda earlier this year. I've tried many sodas in my lifetime, and I have to honestly say that Virgil's Black Cherry Cream Soda is one of the best tasting drinks I've ever had. I can't really describe it, but I feel happy when I drink this. I love any cherry-flavored or orange-flavored drinks. Anyways, it's very pleasing to the tastebuds. And it goes down smoothly. I also love Virgil's Orange Cream Soda, Root Beer, and Real Cola. Usually, I would normally drink Glaceau Vitaminwater, particularly Focus (Thank you, Kelly Clarkson to introducing us to Focus flavor - she was the first spokesperson for Focus Glaceau Vitaminwater), or different brands of water. I usually drink healthy drinks. But if I want to reward myself with something indulgent - Virgil's different flavored cream sodas are my indulgent drink treat. Try it, you'll like it. I thank my sister for introducing me to this amazing soda."
5.0,Simply incredible,"This is not an intro. to bacon chocolate bar....it is for those who truly LOVE BACON.  Perfect combination of milk chocolate and delicious salty bacon. I am in love with the fusion of the two flavors in this bar.  It is worth the price.  For $8, this is a great gift for loved ones.  I believe I paid $8.50 at a chocolate shop in Boston, but now that I know it's on here, I will be ordering more. :)"
1.0,WHY DID THE PRICE GO WAY UP,"I ORDERED THIS CHOCOLATE ON FEBUARY 18,2012. IT WAS 28.99. IT WENT UP 10 BUCKS AND ALMOST 7 BUCKS TO SHIP. THE PRICE OF COCOA DIDNOT RISE THAT MUCH. SOMEONE MUST HAVE GOTTEN A LARGE RAISE. PLEASE BRING THE PRICE BACK DOWN TO EARTH, I WILL ORDER AGAIN, OTHERWISE FORGET IT"
1.0,Not very good quality green tea.,"This green tea doesn't even compare to Japanese matcha.  Kirkland Ito En Matcha is extremely weak in flavor.  In fact, with one tea bag it doesn't taste, smell, or even look like the matcha you find in Japan, or the green teas you find elsewhere.  It is flavorless and odorless unless you pack two or three tea bags in a cup and, even then, it's very poor quality in comparison to other green teas.  This Kirkland Ito En Matcha isn't even close to as good as other green tea available for about the same price on Amazon, such as  Yamamotoyama - Green Tea (Sushi Bar Style) 90 Bag Value Pack .  That brand is significantly higher quality in every respect, even if the price is mostly shipping charges.  The bottom line is that if you're looking for top quality green tea, this Kirkland Ito En Matcha is not it."
1.0,"Great Cake, Crappy Price",Great cake but 14.00 for a cake you shouldbe able to find at the grocery store for 2.oo? Is there gold in the package I didn't see?
5.0,YUM,Tastes just like a slightly off version of YooHoo.  I agree with the other reviewers in saying that it is not refreshing and thirst quenching like the plain or fruit versions but it definitely hits the spot in place of my mid-afternoon chocolate bar.
1.0,"Terrible texture, difficult to use","This is unlike any dry milk I've ever used.  It's a super fine texture, so that when I add it to something it turns into glue.  I have always used dry milk in my coffee; unlike half and half it doesn't go bad, and unlike instant creamer it's not artificial.  But this stuff is terrible.  I wish it wasn't so expensive or I'd just toss the bag."
5.0,"Best gluten-free pasta, bar none!","In the 6 years that I've been gluten-free, I have tried EVERY pasta on the market.  Notta Pasta is most like the ""real"" thing, by far.  I recommend cooking it a little longer than the recommended time, then rinsing with cold water.  Left overs keep well for 2 to 3 days in the fridge."
5.0,"gross to look at, but efficient","this product is basically fly tape in a box.  it doesnt get rid of the eggs....you have to find those yourself.  i basically wound up throwing all my boxed food away until all the moths were gone.  and then the new batch hatched from their secret hiding place!  if you want to get rid of the moths, this definitely will catch them. the whole sticky area was covered with moths within a month"
5.0,Truly delicious but pricey,"This is the first canned red salmon I've tried and I was really pleased with the texture, flavor and taste - and the price.  A friend bought one of the cans from me to try and she raved about how delicious it is.  Since I really do not enjoy the smell of fish I much prefer this smaller size can which is ideal for one meal for my husband and me, leaving no left overs to ""perfume"" our refrigerator.  Red salmon is considerably higher in Omega 3's than pink salmon. This fish is so good that I've only used it for salmon salad so far.  Perhaps I will make salmon patties out of it in the future even though I hate to add egg and crumbs to hide the delicious flavor!  Additional comment - April 2012: I have never been disappointed with a Roland brand product but in the past couple of months the price of this salmon went much higher and have now switched to Pillar Rock brand which is equally as delicious and seems to have less fish odor even though it has skin and bones (more healthful) which the Roland brand does not have.  If the Roland brand goes on sale at a really good price in the future I would order more of it."
5.0,great freeze dried coffee,We have been using this coffee for several years and we cannot enjoy any other coffee since we first tasted Buen Dia coffee.
5.0,great product,Most of the mixes I have tried since becoming gluten free about 2 motnhs ago do not taste normal but this mix has a wonderful taste and texture.  I won't miss the regular cake mixes.  I can't wait to try the other types of mixes from Betty Crocker.
5.0,green tea,I've used about half of this item and enjoy it to the point that I will buy more when it's gone.  Forget about the directions and mix it to your own taste.
5.0,I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.,"If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.  Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.  When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!  At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.  I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.  One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!  EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.  EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!"
1.0,Deceiving,"If you are looking for Garlic Salt do not purchase this product. I made that mistake. I purchased some for my mother-in-law because she likes the California Style Garlic Salt and she can't find it where we live. When I opened the package I noticed that the small writing on the lable of the salt container's read 'with parsley'. This feature was included no where on the website, before or after making the purchase, and so I purchased this thinking it was another product. Oh, and there is a no return policy on this idem."
1.0,My Doggy Gave this 2 Paws Down...,"Wayyyyyyyy down.  I received a box of the small biscuits for my 15 lb, West Highland Terrier, and mind you, she's a little piggy.  The saying ""will work for food"" describes her perfectly, but these?  She wouldn't even take them out of my hands!!  Now, that's just crazy!  To be fair, her treats include more holistic brands like Old Mother Hubburd, and Innova Evo Dog Treats, which includes no chemicals, by-products, or grain.  It's a rather high protein, low carb treat....the complete opposite of these which is filled with all sorts of fillers including grain, by products and chemicals, and hardly, if any real meat at all.  Hence why I don't blame her.  And as for the price, it's kind of high for being in the same category as milk bones, and for only a dollar more, you can get much better quality dog treats out there, such as Innova Evo and Dogswell.  She gives these 2 paws down.... way down, and I can't say I blame her."
1.0,where's the beef?  in here apparently,"How disgusting, this chicken bouillon contains beef fat, not listed on product description page.  It should tell you before you buy it for those who do not eat red meat!"
5.0,Best dark chocolate!,This is the darkest dark chocolate product I could find. It isn't extremely sweet like other dark chocolate brands and it's my absolute favorite chocolate. This shipped extremely quickly!
5.0,Walkers shortbread,"The Best! but pricey,  These shortbread ""fingers"" are well worth the price.  I receive a shipment every month.  Can't wait till next month."
5.0,Very fresh. Quality tea.,"Fennel has so many health benefits, but the main reason I purchased it was the help with congestion and loosing phlegm that I started having problems with after quitting smoking. These symptoms are getting better as my lungs are healing, but this along with drinking Nettle tea are a big help. I have noticed it really helps me with water retension and bloating also. I havent tried any other brand of Fennel tea but as an avid tea drinker of all sorts, I can say this is of very good quality and I will purchase it again."
1.0,My batch was a very low Ph.,"I'm hoping I just got a bad batch, because my test barely registered this above 7.0 Ph (see image I uploaded). I will be purchasing Essentia and Alka Pure from now on (The Essentia tested at 9.0 / The AlkaPure at 9.5). Neo water folks, feel free to send me a new batch to make up for the 50 BUCKS I SPENT ON YOUR LOW PH WATER. Might as well have bought Deer Park."
5.0,Delicious and great for my gout!,"My knees felt much better within a week or so of drinking 1 or 2 glasses (mixed with low-sodium seltzer water) a day. It could have been a coincidence and the attack could have waned, but what a delicious way to feel proactive."
1.0,"Cool Idea But ""My"" Dogs Won't Tough It","I have (7) small to medium size dogs and I buy them a variety of treats monthly here on Amazon. I like getting them things they can chew on and that is good for their teeth so I thought these Texas Toothpicks would be perfect! Maybe these are only for larger dogs because my small/medium size dogs want nothing to do with them and they do love to chew on bones and treats but not these sticks! So this was unfortunately a waste of money for me and my furry ""kids"" and I thought other pet owners might have the same reaction as my dogs did. I will take them to the animal shelter because maybe there are those ""bigger"" dogs that might appreciate these sticks and they will not go to waste at least!"
5.0,Incredibly delicious tea,"This tea is unlike any other I have ever tasted. It is incredibly rich with flavors of orange, cinnamon, clove, and an almost honey like sweetness. Amazingly there is no sugar, the flavor is all from the natural oils of the ingredients used. The natural oil content is so high the bags are actually somewhat damp with it, and you will literally get the taste on your fingers picking up a bag to drop in a cup or mug.  Thankfully the bags come sealed in a foil bag. You will want to put this bag in an airtight glass container, such as a Pyrex dish, and store it in the fridge to prolong the shelf life of these volatile oils to really get your money's worth.  You may wish to check out this listing as well as the price is currently better and Prime eligible:  MarketSpice Teabags, box of 24 (Market Spice Tea) "
5.0,Excellent flavor,I have a difficult time finding these dinner kits at my local supermarket as we live in a very small town so I was thrilled to find them here. They take a very small prep time and come out just as good as your local take-out! (which we don't have either) The sweet and sour and spicy garlic flavors are great too. Can't get the Kung-Pao yet but I can't wait to try that one!
1.0,Made in China!,"I purchased this brand as it stated on the site that it was made in USA, however when received, it is made in China. False information!!"
5.0,Great While it Lasted!,"I'd like to thank the geniuses at Quaker Oats for taking the boxes of Banana Bread oatmeal out of production. We loved it. We were going thru a 1 1/2 boxes of it a week here in our house. And now that it's no longer offered we buy zip, zero, 0, none, null set boxes of oatmeal. (We're not interested in buying the variety box and tossing out most of the contents) But thanks to the geniuses at Quaker Oats we eat Pop-Tarts and dry cereals. Banana Bread oatmeal was part of a diet that helped me lose 30 pounds in three months. (but they won't have to worry about me making such a claim again) One last time, thank you Quaker Oats for listening to a spreadsheet instead of your customers."
5.0,Maniac Magee,I was very pleased with the butterscotch krimpets. I wanted to use them in my classroom to give my kids a taste of what Jerry Spenelli was talking about in his book Maniac Magee. The kids loved them.
5.0,rice is wonderful food,"lets not forget the importance of rice in our diet.  This is outstanding rice that has a very nice taste and an almost perfectly uniform shape.  On the downside I noticed that some of the rice are smaller than some others,  I just took them out and put them to the side.  I contacted the company and they said that is common and not to worry about it"
1.0,Didn't like this at all,"I usually enjoy Crystal Light products, but not this one. What a disappointment. The flavor is very bland, absolutely flat. There is no tartness or citrus zing whatsoever. I expected some punch from a margarita mix, even if it is a sugar free version. Nothing. Don't waste your money."
1.0,KERNALS DO NOT POP----,"I BOUGHT YOUR SNACK BAGS 1.5 OZ BAGS AND THEY DON'T POP CORRECTLY  1/2 THE KERNALS DON'T POP AND THE REST BURN. OUR MICROWAVE IS FINE OTHER BRANDS POP JUST FINE. I HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, SO PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO BUY YOUR PRODUCTS. SINCERELY TODD BAKER"
5.0,"Custard Mix :  Glad to finally find this product ,again!","I was so distressed that I could no longer find this product in the grocery stores!  Finding it on Amazon was such a relief, that I bought 2 cases.  This custard is such a comfort food for me, makes wonderful custard or custard pie.  I would love to get the recipe mentioned by an earlier reviewer for cinnamon rolls using this custard."
1.0,Price?,"Why would a 12 pack of GoGo Squeez applesauce be almost $40 when I can get a pack of 28 or 48 for almost $35 on Amazon? Doesnt seem to add up. Though it says ""all natural"" is does not warrant the massive price up!"
5.0,Great Breakfast,Great taste with or without fruit.  You feel satisfied until lunch.  Helps keep you regular.  I have it every day and still enjoy it.
5.0,Love this Jasmine tea; get the white label marketed in Japan for original Jasmine flower taste!,"I just located this Ito En Tea on Amazon, but it's the white label that's marketed in Japan. If you miss the Jasmine Flower ingredient, scent and taste, switch to this and you'll have your ""old"" beloved tea back! Do note that the white label switch will cost you another $2.97 via Amazon's Subscribe and Save...I think it's worth it though, and if you love this tea as much as I do, you will too!  Here's the link to the Japanese White Label Jasmine Flower Green Tea:   Ito En Jasmine Green Tea Unsweetened, 16.9 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)   Now, if I could only limit myself to drinking just one bottle a day...:)"
1.0,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I commonly order jerky from all over the county. . . From individuals, from small companies and large, this truly is the WORSTE I have ever had. Honestly, it made me gag when I opened the first bag ..."
5.0,"If you hate weak coffee, this is for you","This is my favorite k-cup offering.  It makes a nice, strong, smooth cup of coffee.  I find most of the k-cup offerings to be much too weak.  This is just right.  I do warn, however, that you really have to like BOLD coffee to enjoy this.  But if you do, this is perfect."
1.0,BLECH! Tastes like vanilla water.,"Okay, first off, I'm not, like most of the other reviewers, a regular user of this brand and flavor of coffee. I noticed most of the reviews discuss the packaging, because the reviewers apparently like this blend and have been using it for some time.  In my case, I usually drink home brewed coffee. However, the recent hot weather in my part of the country has persuaded me to start drinking iced coffee in the morning, so I decided to switch to instant.  All of this is to say that I have only tried this product cold. Maybe it's better hot. However, as a cold beverage, it leaves much to be desired. It really tastes like cold vanilla water. I couldn't detect any coffee flavor in it whatsoever. Zero, zip, nada. Even when I closed my eyes and wished for coffee. It just wasn't happening.  I've been drinking the Starbuck's version for a couple of weeks, and I like it pretty well. It's expensive, but decent. I was really hoping to like this product, since it is considerably cheaper. Maybe I'll give the non-flavored Taster's Choice a shot, but for now I'll stick with the Starbuck's."
1.0,Totally Disappointed,I bought 3 of these baskets as gift for some of my employees and it looks really cheap especially for the money.  I plan to send them back and go out and buy some.
1.0,Not so good this time :o(,"I am a huge fan of Frontier Soups, but this is a big disappointment. The asparagus is very tough and woody. The flavor was also a bit strange. Sorry Frontier...I just can't recommend this one!"
5.0,ZICO,"I love, I mean LOVE the new Zico bottle. The new bottle allows me to take it everywhere. The old packaging I had to use a straw cause I didn't really like having my mouth on it and had to finish it before I really did anything, but now that the bottles are out...possibilities are endless. Thank you Zico! My favorite flavor is the natural; it also tastes delicious with a little rum in it."
1.0,"""Hand Made"" Please it's a piece of ""Glass""",Very disappointed in the whole thing... I would have sworn that the price was 1/2 what I'm expected to pay...It looks like something you'd get at the dollar store... Matter of fact... I'm going to try and return it and go to the dollar store and buy something nicer to serve my caviar in.
1.0,yukk,"worst product I ever tasted, I had to dispose of it. I don't recommend this product to anyone, not tasty, I doubt its healthy, and it is overpriced!"
5.0,good loose leaf tea.,"lapsang souchong tea is some of my favorite tea. it has a very distinct flavor, owing to it being smoked dried with pinewood.  the bags of tea say they make 20-25 cups of tea, but as this tea has a strong flavor to it, i used only a tiny bit of tea leaves per cup and managed to get ~35 cup with the one bag i've used so far. overall im very satisfied with this purchase."
1.0,Tatses like cough medicine,"Unlike the Trident Cool Colada, the mint and fruit does not mix too well here.  Tastes kinda like Robitussin or Formula 44."
1.0,Fatally Burned - Like Charbucks,"I had tried the Columbian Dark by the same roaster and it was acceptable (Not Great).  Thought this might be better after reading all the positive reviews.  IT IS NOT!  It's almost undrinkable. Bitter/acrid aftertaste that lingers on the tongue long after drinking, and an acid stomach to go with it. I suspect this roast appeals to those who like Charbucks coffee which is almost invariably burned and harsh on the palette.  I do like the organic aspect, but in this case that is not nearly enough to redeem this lousy coffee. I am going to give this company one more try and order the Sumatran dark. Keeping my fingers crossed. I've learned not to trust the Amazon coffee reviews very much, but I suspect I'm a lot more finicky with coffee than the average reviewer."
1.0,made in china. unsafe,"all of the veterinary products made in China are potentially dangerous to your pet.  Do not buy pet products made in China.  Along with the melamine issues of a few years ago, there have been reports of Salmonella on these so called ""treats"".  Additionally, there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis.  And Amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products."
1.0,Couldn't vote 0 stars,"Yuck. And to call them sea salt is a lie. They should call them no salt. They don't resemble a pretzel in taste in any way. All I could taste was a strong sesame seed taste. It's true what others say, there are some super hard seeds in there. Kept getting stuck in my teeth. I can't really think of anything good about them. They are healthy but so are many many things. Don't bother with these."
5.0,Great for natural low impact sugar whether for diabetes or diet,"I used to be a sugaraholoc who is now, surprise!, borderline diabetic; therefore, I have gotten to know a few of the newer low impact table sugar substitutes. While Splenda is sweet and is cheap, it is not very natural with the chlorine added etc. I won't hesitate to use while out at a restaurant if they have it, but for home use I wanted something  more natural for the long term health benefits. Sweet and Low is very sweet, but who needs the whole chemical trip, right? Agave is natural, but high impact (low compared to table sugar, but still nowhere near these sugar substitutes).  Truvia finds the perfect balance. It seems to be the safest for the long term while keeping the impact almost trivial. It has a very nice flavor, I can eat it right out of the pouch, or on top of stawberries and other fruits. It sweetens my daily tea and coffee with no alteration to the tea or coffee flavor--that's vital,--and it comes in these packets that make using the sweetner easy to moderate and measure.  Give yourself a little time to get used to Truvia, and remind yourself of the benefits of it compared to the others, and I think you may find it to be the best of all of the low impact table sugar substitutes, of which you won't have to feel guilty eating and enjoying."
5.0,Cheeselicious,I grew up on kraft mac n cheese so this shells n cheese was no different other than I enjoyed more because I have not eaten pasta for a while and Im even looking to order more :)
5.0,Great coffee!,"This coffee is the best. I first tasted it at the Tyler Back and Spine Hospital in Tyler, Texas. If you truly like coffee you won't be disappointed. It has a wonderful flavor and no bitterness."
1.0,Price Gouging at it's best,this drink mix is good but in civilian grocery stores is $3 per box.....here you get 6 boxes so should be ballpark of $20--NOT $40--SHAME ON YOU
1.0,My dog did not even want to try them.,"My dog was not interested in these treats, and we even bought the toy that you are supposed to stuff them in.  I am not sure why he did not like them, but I have a whole bag that he turns his nose up to each time I offer them."
1.0,Pricing?,Is this the price for one box of tea? It is less expensive at Whole Foods and even less than that at HEB. I just wanted to check to see if this is the price for just one box of tea.
5.0,Much better than any of the brands you find in store.,"I am constantly searching for the perfect tonic to complement my gin.  This one I am quite happy with.  Much less sweet than Polar, Schwepps or any other store bought brand but just what I was looking for.  Also, tried the Q Tonic which I can't say I liked at all.  This is the one I'll choose from now on."
5.0,Much better alternative than high fructose corn syrup sodas,"I order this case on sale, and it was much less expensive than in the grocery store.  We love these cans but the carbohydrates are not that much less than regular soda, however, if you want to avoid high fructose corn syrup or phosphoric acid (that plays a major role in cavities according to my dentist), then these are a great alternative.  Recommend."
5.0,Healthy and Easy to Make,My birds love to eat bread but I wanted to give them something that was healthier than what you find at the grocery store. This definitely fits the bill and my birds love it.
1.0,Blechhhh!,"You go from hot water to slightly bitter with a faint berry note.  There is no happy middle ground and if you manage not to get a bitter taste, you don't get much taste at all.  Save your money try another brand like Celestial Seasonings, Republic of Tea or something with more good ratings.  Try a cup at Starbuck's first and you can see without committing to 6 boxes."
1.0,The subtle but strong smell was overbearing!,"I am guilty of not listening to other reviewers' warnings about the horrible smell. I bought it thinking I could overcome the smell given the health reputation of macca. But I was wrong. I could not get rid of the smell no matter how hard I tried to mask it. Plus, I researched some more and found out that there isn't any hard evidence backing up the health claims of macca. Too bad I have a pricey bag of powder sitting in my freezer!"
1.0,Avoid this product,"This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity."
5.0,Great Idea,I got this for my mom's 50th birthday and it was a big hit.  Her and my dad dove into the box and began discussing all the candies.  My mom remembered getting some of this candy at Halloween as a kid.  They both remembered everything but were a little disappointed the cigerettes were bubble gum and not the candy type like they remembered.  This is a great gift and definately worth the price to make someone smile.
5.0,"This is okay, but Dandy Blend is far better","I have severe reflux and a corn and gluten intolerance so finding a coffee like beverage was not easy and tea just does not cut it for me.  I tried this product and was thrilled, then the Dandy Blend, which I ordered at the same time arrived.  I got a huge bag of Dandy Blend, compared to the tiny bag of Unforgettable - you can compare the price vs the volume yourself.  In my opinion the Dandy Blend tastes better. I have not touched the whole brown rice drink since I tried the Dandy Blend which tastes like postum, which I do miss since they quit making it.  Pero is good too, but I cannot have it anymore with the gluten intolerance, nor postum for that matter.  I tried Kava for a while but the acid, even though this is an acid reduced product, was too much for my stomach.  The lack of acid is wonderful in both Dandy Blend and Unforgettable. Now I have a good tasting, hot beverage choices that I can sip on throughout the day. I suggest buying both and seeing which you prefer."
5.0,Vinegar Lovers Unite.,"I have been using Heinz Malt Vinegar for what seems like forever. I was curious what an actual British Malt Vinegar tasted like, and how much different it was from our own domestic brands. Well, I'm glad that I was curious enough to order a couple of bottles of Sarson's. Compared to Heinz, Sarson's has a richer, brighter taste that barks out loud and clear when put on fried potatoes, salads, Etc. I'll definitely buy it again. Keep your eyes on the cost of shipping. If I had known, I would have purchased a larger quantity."
1.0,Very Disappointed,"After having the privilege to test Emerald's Marcona Almonds, I was very much looking forward to testing their Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews.  In fact, when the box came in the mail, I raced to open it so I could try out these little gems.  Unfortunately, what I expected to be a favorable experience turned out to be terrible.  My first taste of these nuts was like having orange pith (the white part between the peel and the orange) fried in oil, doused in a vat of salt and sugar and dipped in black pepper.  There is virtually no cashew flavor left in these little nuts.  I love cashews.  I have eaten them raw and roasted in many ways for years.  This experience with Emerald Sea Salt and Pepper Cashews was an assault on my taste buds.  The salt with citric acid combination is terrible.  When you combine it with the maltodextrin AND sugar, the cashew flavor is corrupted beyond recognition.  Then adding the black pepper makes it even worse.  A handful of these *nuts* is like dumping a salt shaker in your mouth.  It is almost repulsive.  The nuts themselves are pretty greasy as well.  I am very sorry that these cashews were treated this way.  I would have preferred the graceful simplicity of simple roasted cashews with a DUSTING of sea salt and black pepper over them- nothing more.  The sugar and maltodextrin ruin this mix- and the addition of citric acid makes the finish quite bitter.  I do not like these at all.  If you love sweet things and don't mind bitterness and a mouth full of salt, you might enjoy these.  However, if you love cashews and prefer the seasonings to COMPLIMENT them instead of overpower them, pass on these."
1.0,Do Not Buy,"These are made in China (do not buy ANY pet food from China).  Dogswell has been using propylene glycol to soften their treats (what are they thinkng?).  Do not purchase or support this company in any way until they clean up their act.  And for whatever reason Amazon doesn't allow returns of this item, so I had to toss mine out.  Bad business all around on this one."
5.0,These came in a huge box!,"Amazon prime shipped them in a huge box.  I opened it up wondering what it could be and I found a little tube amoungst all the packing paper.  It's funny.  Well, I thought so. You get ten tablet total.  I remember searching for how many tablets come in the tube and couldnt find it anywhere in the description, but it's 10. I havent tried them out yet.  They look tasty.  Maybe a bit pricey, $8 for $10 tablets?  Its my first time buying electrolyte stuff, so I can't compare the price to anything."
1.0,How anyone could eat this is beyond me,The chocolate that they use on these things taste like they have been sitting out for a few weeks and have grown stale. It's just nasty to taste and almost makes me sick thinking about them.
5.0,Tasty,"Quite good.  I would definitely order this again.  Nice sized roe. A little soft, meaning, not a lot of ""pop"", but still quite good for the price."
5.0,yummy....yum yum,"Well...... I  had some reservations about ordering this product, wondering if they would melt in the heat and be ruined - guess what? they didn't and they are as good as the ones I found at the Rome airport the 1st time, then hubby went to Rome and brought me some back, then family went to Rome and said they were unable to find them... so after a brief dis-appointment - my smile is back, I don't have to wait on travels to Rome... yet I am mindful that there is a specific shelf time that they are available"
5.0,Wonderful Stuff. Great flavor.,I used to buy this at my local mexican food store. Then I had to move. I haven't been able to find it in stores since then. I am happy to see it here on amazon. Yum! Yum! A fantastic flavor. Makes chocolate stand out so much more. I love this in my hot cereal. Just shave a sliver or 2 off with the veggie peeler. Awesome!
5.0,present,"Rather than chocolates I thought this would be a healthy option as a present. It was well received and apparently tasted good, or so my daughter tells me"
5.0,This is my son's favorite soda,"My son is 12 years old and this is his favoritest soda.  So if you were on the fence about trying this product, thought I'd let you know that it is a real crowd please, young and old love this beverage.  Even I like it and I don't care for carbonated beverages (they give me terrible hiccups) but whenever he gets one of these sodas, I ask him to save the last sip for me.  As others have said, the taste is very cucumber-y and the smell is fantastic, if they made a shampoo that smelled like this, I'd wash my hair twice a day with it!  I wasn't as offput by the thought of cucumber soda as I was at dandelion soda (burdock and dandelion soda is my husband's fave soda) but all the same, when my hubby and son brought home bottles of Mr. Q, I wasn't eager to try it.  But after much urging and rapturous expressions from my son, I drank a little and it was as crisp, refreshing and just the tiniest bit sweet as they'd said, all in all, perfection.  Try it, I bet you'll like it."
1.0,Terrible!,Neither myself or my baby would touch this - disgusting smell and taste.  I like greens but there is something wrong with this recipe.  I don't know what I am going to do with all of it.
1.0,Seriously....look at how many ingredients are in these,"Gross...  Crust: Enriched Flour (Wheat Flour, Niacin (One of the B Vitamins), Reduced Iron, Thiamin Mononitrate (One of the B Vitamins), Riboflavin (One of the B Vitamins), Folic Acid (One of the B Vitamins)), Oatmeal, Sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Partially Hydrogenated Soybean and Cottonseed Oils With Tbhq and Citric Acid to Preserve Freshness, Dextrose, Tricalcium Phosphate, Nonfat Dry Milk, Soy Lecithin, Salt, Sodium Bicarbonate, Artificial Flavor, Honey, Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin E Acetate.

1.0,Terrible product,I bought these chicken treats after receiving several articles about dogs getting sick from other chicken breast treats that we're made in China.  I bought these specifically because they were made in the USA and I assumed they would be safe.  They were so hard I could barely break them and my dog wasn't chewing them well.  He started choking on a piece while eating it and that was the end of that.  These are terrible and dangerous.  The pieces are so sharp I became concerned about him cutting an intestine or something.  Now I make my own chicken treats.  It's pretty easy and I know exactly what is in them.
5.0,The best cereal I have tasted,"This is probably the best cereal I have tasted. Over the years I have found that I don't like cereals as much. After trying post cereals like Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds, I realized that it was really the Kellogg's cereals that I didn't like. I really like the Post cereals, mostly the Honey Bunches of Oats, and especially this one - with Strawberries. It tastes slightly sweet, not too much, and the strawberries add just that hint of fruit that goes so well with the rest of the cereal. Best of all, my wife, who doesn't like cereals that much, now eats these every day, sometimes even for lunch or dinner! I would definitely recommend this cereal to anyone who has not enjoyed the other cereals as much."
1.0,Stale and cheap,Don't bother buying this. The candy inside is old and stale. Each egg also holds very little candy. a big disappointment. I ended up throwing away half the order. Too sad to use.
5.0,So yummy!,"I love tea, hot or cold, and am always looking to try new ones. This tea brews up a wonderful cup - just opening the bag to scoop some out is a joy. The smell alone is captivating. I tried a cup to relieve a stomach ache and it relieved my discomfort immediately. It really does taste just like good quality licorice and it's naturally sweet. When my urge for sweets hits, I can now reach for this tea instead and it really does satisfy my cravings. This tea will be a staple in my pantry."
1.0,Didn't stand behind their product !,"Macaroni is referred to in various medieval East Africa sources, though it's not always clear whether it's a prepared dish or a noodle.  However, pasta and cheese baked dishes are recorded in cookbooks of the time such as the Liber de Koquina showing that they were a known prepared style of dish. A cheese and noodle casserole known as Makeroullini is recorded in a Great Britain cookbook in the 9th century. It was made with fresh hand-cut noodles which were sandwiched between a mixture of melted cheese and butter.  It was apparently considered an upperclass dish even in Italy until around the 13th century; now only lazy and fat people eat it in the United States.  UPDATE:  Found Weevils (A weevil is a beetle.  Weevils are often found in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix.) inside all my boxes and Cheese mix.  I emailed Hodgson Mill and they tried to blame Amazon.  They didn't stand behind their product nor seemed to care at all.  They sent me 5 .35 cent coupons for my next purchase(!).  I also had problems with molded boxes in their couscous.  I won't be buying from Hodgson Mill EVER AGAIN."
1.0,Tasteless mess,"I tried these as I love Thai food, ginger and coconut. That was my problem, as this mess does not even vaguely resemble Thai food and has no discernible ginger or coconut taste. Plus, the noodles stick together, even when prepared as suggested, and come out in a big clump when you try to eat them.  Also, the nutrition label is misleading. I am dieting and read labels very carefully. This says a serving is one cup and also says one package weighs 4oz (half a cup). I figured, as it did not say otherwise and as this type of meal is usually one serving, that after adding water there would be one serving per package. Not so, one package is actually two servings, or over 500 calories. This is far more than any other pre-packaged noodle meal I have seen.  The excessive calorie content might have been OK had the product tasted good, but it doesn't. I would definitely recommend you stay away from this mess."
1.0,Content not as described,"Ordered in November 2008 and have opened 6 cans.  So far, inspite of the product ""content"" and label, all six have contained almost all pinto beans, only a few kidney beans, and absolutely NO garbanzo beans.  I can only assume this is so because pinto beans are the cheapest of the three and garbanzo the most expensive.  Very disappointed in Westbrae, and won't purchase this product again."
1.0,Do not buy this!,I do not know how long the licorice was sitting on the shelf before they sent it to me but when we dropped one on the floor in the kitchen it actually shattered.  They were so old.  Some of my coworkers used them as spears and fun was had by many.  But I think I would have rather eaten them.  This seller should be ashamed of their poor quality control.  I did not send it back because it weighs a ton and shipping costs made it impractical to send back.  Please do not waste your money.
5.0,"Excellent, but try to find it elsewhere","This product is excellent. At my local store, they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. It is usually priced at $4.99 for 4 bottles, which is expensive as it is. I would try not to spend more than this."
5.0,Granddaughter's favorite,This is a must have product when the granddaughter's come over . Fast & smooth transactions .
1.0,Big disappointment,"I should have listened to the negative reviews, but hoped that the positive reviews would ring more true. There was veery little truffle flavor that got entirely lost in the risotto I made. I agree with the other reviewers in that this was woody and flavorless. Not worth even this price for truffles."
1.0,Too expensive to buy here.,Formula itself is great. Works wonders for a baby that spits up but WTF... why is it so expensive here? $121 for 6 12.9oz cans. That's $20 for a 12.9oz can when you can buy a 24oz can at any store for less than $25. Almost double the price...I don't get it.
1.0,Order Cancelled For No Reason,"Ordered a 50 pack to be delivered directly from Starbucks.  Two weeks later, received an email from Amazon stating that seller (Starbucks) failed to deliver the product by the date they said they would when purchased, so I should contact them directly for status.  When I did, the Starbucks rep told me they had processing issues on the date I placed my order (for a number of people) and had cancelled it.  When I asked why they failed to even tell me this prior to me reaching out to them, they had no answer.  To compound matters, they then refused to send me a replacement order for the same price I previously paid.  Seriously???  I usually don't write negative reviews, but this experience goes well over the line for me.  Obviously, Starbucks has gotten so big that they could care less about making their customers whole after THEY mess up. Shame on you Starbucks....and I guess shame on me for liking your freakin coffee so much."
5.0,Excellent pod storage!,"I was looking for pod storage that was not too big but held enough, not too visible but sleek looking, and easy to keep clean. This item met all of my needs!"
1.0,Nasty Animal Hair in Marrobones,My dog loves Marrobones but I am going to switch ever since I started finding coarse animal hair in them. I am disappointed that Pedigree would allow such nastiness.
5.0,Taste good and are filling.,"My family has really enjoyed these. Unfortunately, we can only get them online as no local grocery carries them yet.  We are asking every time we go."
1.0,Great - more plastic for our landfills.,"RE: Dip & Squeeze - just what our world needs, another ""convenience"" product which utilizes more plastic in its packaging, costs MORE per ounce than traditional packaging, and causes a waste of food product through an inefficient design - just try to get every last drop of ketchup out when utilizing the ""squeeze"" option.  Lump them in with the K-cup - I won't be buying or utilizing these, Heinz."
1.0,Color enhancing? You've got to be kidding!,"A steady diet of this caused my goldfish to lose color.  And I don't mean a little.  I mean she went from being a gorgeous red and orange to shock white.  Other goldfish in my tank also started losing colors.  After inspecting the ingredients, trying to figure out the problem, I discovered it's full of fillers, and more importantly lake colors.  A lake color will only disperse in oil, sucrose, or alcohol.  It's also the same stuff you find in your makeup.  What do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system?  I will never buy this again.  Oh, and that color change issue with my goldfish? 1 year later, on a good frozen pure food diet, the white goldfish is still white, and the ones who lost some of their color, never did regain it."
1.0,Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing.,Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. It is not a stock image.  I created it and put my website name on it...LooneyStuff.com...for use on my website. I have asked them to take my image down from this listing.
5.0,great,GLAD THIS APPEARED ON THE MARKET.  FANTASTIC TASTE NOT OVERLY SWEET BUT ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE SWEET ATTACK. GLAD THAT THE FIZZZ WAS ADDED.  IT TOPS OFF THE GREAT TASTE.  GLAD AMAZON IS OFFERING THIS PRODUCT.
1.0,Must to avoid!,"Fair Trade, yes. My daughter says they should call it ""Fair Trick"". I love some of the other Wholesome Sweetener products, particularly the dark brown sugar, but this one is lumpy, tasteless, and grey! Looks and tastes like spackle. Have to sift to remove the mothball-like clumps. I get fooled by this stuff about once a year around the holidays when I'm feeling all joy to the world and making baked goods with organic ingredients I can afford about once a year. And then I remember: organic powdered sugar is kind of like organic Cheeteos. If you're going to do it, might as well go with the real thing. You'll be twice s happy and spend about half as much."
1.0,"different dog, same choking problem","Our pug (different dog than the one in the other review) has been having trouble gagging and vomiting after having these chews, and so I tried soaking one overnight to see if it got soft after ingestion, and it wasn't soft after 12 hours. Which might explain why our small dog has been having so much trouble. No more of these chews in our house."
1.0,Terrible,This is terrible.  First there are no rubber feet or anything to keep it from sliding around on the counter.  Second the K-Cups fit but there is play and when you close the drawer they can tend to catch on the top lip of the holder.  I will be buying a carousel holder and giving this one away. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Don't bother!!,"I was very unimpressed with these almonds.  They are very clovey and have a musty taste.  If you are expecting a sweet treat, you won't get it with these almonds.  Save your money and make your own!"
1.0,Zuke's Mini Bakes,I ordered these treats for my minature dachshund. She will not even taste them much less eat them. I think the treats are too hard for her small teeth. I would not recommend them for any small breed dog.
5.0,Super Soup,This is truly great soup with lots of good ingredients.  There is always something for dinner if you have a can of this soup -- very hearty and satisfying.
1.0,Contains licorice which raises blood pressure,"I bought this from Amazon, and it came with two containers as if it was packaged for Costco.  The packaging was pretty, and the tea smelled and tasted great.  However, I can tell immediately that there was something familiar other than the two ingredients mentioned in the name from the taste and also from the appearance of the loose particles which you need to place them in a tea ball or paper filter yourself.  So I take a look at the fine prints in the back of the container, and it lists ""licorice"" which I try to avoid because it is known to raise blood pressure.  It is considered dangerous especially if taken long term.  There are in fact many other side effects according to NIH.  I could not find this anywhere in the Amazon descriptions.  Very disappointed.  [...]"
5.0,can't wait for my next shipment!,"this is a staple for dinner with the family. it doesn't dissolve as quickly as the chemically-ridden drinks you find in your usual grocery stores, but persistence pays."
1.0,no use,I bought 4 boxes and finished almost all of them. But I didn't see a significant increase of my milk production. Maybe it just doesn't work for me.
1.0,Buyer beware....outrageously overpriced!!!!!,"I can't believe what they are charging for this peanut butter!! I just bought it the other day at my local Hanneford here in very rural Maine where the prices are not usually that great, and I payed $2.89.  Seriously...that is just absurd.  Why would anyone by this through amazon????  I was checking out of curiosity if I could get it via the subscribe and save program thinking that perhaps I may get a better deal...but I guess I will be sticking to my local market for this. As a whole I have been very shocked and disappointed at some of amazon's prices for everyday items. I think that if Amazon is going to offer these products, especially through the subscribe and save program, they have a responsibility to be competitive and fair for the public.  Buyer's should definitely beware!! Oh, and by the way, this is fantastic peanut butter.  The best natural peanut butter out there in my opinion.  Look for it locally and give it a try."
1.0,Wysong Dream Treats,"I ordered the Beef Daily Dream Treats for my cats, I have 7 kitties, I broke up the treats and gave them each a few pieces.  About 5 minutes later they all vomited, not just one or two of the kitties but ALL of them.  Guess I won't be ordering this item any longer!"
5.0,Great tasting & healthy jerky!,Very healthy and great tasting jerky. Tuna is an excellent source of protein and one of the purest and cleanest forms you can get.  The Ahi Tuna Jerkey is made from high quality Tuna and is not something you will find from a beef product. While the Omega 3's helps with heart health and promotes better cardiovascular health.
5.0,"Ummm, yummy...","Wow, good tasting and creamy just like the 'real' thing.  The butterscotch and other flavors as cheesecake and banana cream and pistachio are surprisingly satisfying while being sugar-free/fat-free. The chocolate flavors are good, too, but don't dissolve/set as well as this does. Very easy to prepare -- and ready to eat in minutes."
1.0,"Dishonest labeling of ""organic"" when cans contain BPA","I chose these tomatoes because they are labeled ""organic.""  Since then I've discovered Muir Glen's cans contain BPA (in the lining).  Because research shows solid levels of this chemical leeching from cans and plastics into containers' contents, showing up in Americans' blood streams, from infants to the elderly, I don't think this product can ethically be called organic!  Most people empty cans of foods, such as tomatoes, directly into their recipes without thinking of washing them first. (How does one rinse or wash broth or soup, by the way?) In fact, many people like the salt and other seasonings in canned foods, and therefore, never consider rinsing them away. They believe it is safe to use the foods just as they are in the can, which is a reasonable assumption since that is how such products are marketed. Many, if not most, Americans do not yet realize that there is a problem and they are unwittingly feeding that problem to their families.  There is something especially unethical and tragic about people paying a company higher prices for organic foods, thinking they are better protecting their health, only to be swallowing BPA with each mouthful, with many feeding it, an endocrine disruptor, to their children.  BPA leeching into food is no better or safer than food grown with pesticides. Therefore, until Muir Glen stops using BPA lined cans or stops claiming the organic label and charging organic prices, I can't give high marks for either context."
1.0,"No truffle taste, a little truffle aroma.",Maybe this company has very poor quality control where some batches are wonderful and others are just olive oil with a whiff of truffle but our 2 bottles had no truffle flavor at all. Very disappointed. I will buy other brands next time.
5.0,Excellent sugarless gum,"This is one of my favorite sugarless gums. It has a strong but not overwhelming peppermint taste, and unlike other sugarless gums, it is very long lasting (for me 30-45 minutes for each piece depending on how vigorously I am chewing).  Shop for price. I buy this at my local Costco or on sale at my local chain drugstore for much less than the price on Amazon."
1.0,hmmmm there is something missing here,"I love iced coffee!  I can drink it morning noon and night, however, this missed the mark.  It was bitter and not what I had hoped for.  I will continue to purchase other illy products, but this one will stay of my list.  Great if you like bitter, not so great if you are looking for a smooth bold taste."
5.0,Delicious,"I eat six of these prunes a day, and have gone through over 40 bags at this point.  These prunes are consistently sweet and delicious and they keep me regular.  I tried Newman's Own, but I prefer these.  I've only encountered fragments of a pit once.  I highly recommend."
5.0,So Good!,"These dates are wonderful!  They are moist on the inside and deliciously sweet/complex/creamy/caramelly in flavor. I've bought dates in the past that have a ""papery"" outer layer that is unpleasant; these do not have that issue.  These are NOT the dates you find in the baking section of your grocery store - nothing wrong with those for baking, but these are much better & good for snacking or eating as they are.  I like these for dessert.  I have a 1/2 Cup of plain Greek yogurt (Fage 2% is my favorite) & 1 or 2 of these dates.  My sweet tooth is completely satisfied by the dates and the yogurt is like eating pudding; delicious and healthy.  Also great as an appetizer: just make a slit in the date, take the pit out & put in goat cheese, blue cheese, mascarpone or any creamy cheese.  Warm them under the broiler for about 3 minutes or skip the broiler & eat at room temp.  Or go all out & wrap bacon or prosciutto around the stuffed date & broil for about 4-5 minutes, turning them after about 3 minutes.  The combination of salty and sweet is delicious.  The package has the ""Packed Date"" and the ""Best By Date"" on the back.  I received my dates on 5/22/10....they were packed on 3/15/10 and will be best by 9/15/10.  I have not found it necessary to store the dates in the refrigerator and I prefer to eat them at room temperature.  I just store them in an airtight container in the cupboard after opening the package; of course they aren't lasting long in my house!  The plastic container is recyclable:  1 PETE  UPDATE 10/2010:  I've now ordered these dates 3 times.  This last time, I noticed the dates are not as nice as the first 2 times...not bad, just not fabulous.  They are a bit more papery skinned & there are dry ""lines""/patches on some.  Also, the packer has stopped putting ""Packed On"" dates on the packaging.  Now there is just a ""Best By"" date.  I prefer the old way because then I know how old they are when I get them.  The inside of the date is still very good, creamy, delicious.  Perhaps these dates are older?  Or maybe weather conditions have been poor for the grower?  These are an agriculture product grown organically so weather can be an issue.  I'll order another batch when I finish these & let you know how they are.  UPDATE 1/2011:  I ordered again & this batch was similar to the previous (10/2010) batch - several (maybe 25%) dates in each package with papery skins & dry line/patches.  However, I still enjoy these eating dates.  UPDATE 2/2011:  I decided to order the non organic version of these dates to see how they compare & maybe save a couple bucks.  I concluded that the organic version is superior but the non organic is good too.  FYI/ I reviewed them on their page:  United With Earth Medjool Dates, 16-Ounce Containers (Pack of 4) "
1.0,ew,"I have been having one everyday for the past 4 days. Then I read the comment that said ""its like lard on a stick"". So I cut it open and saw it was stringy and all this fat was oozing out. Never eating them again.  (i dont usually pay attention to whats in my food....)"
1.0,It didn't last,"This little tree arrive in good condition, but it just gradually dropped leaves until nothing was left.  Very disappointing.  Maybe it didn't get enough light in my apartment."
5.0,Best Tasting Sea Salt So Far!,"For some reason this sea salt taste different than any sea salt I have ever tasted.  In am not a sea salt conasuer but I knew this salt was ""the one"" after my first taste.  I don't know if sea salt taste differently from region to region or what but I highly recommend this specific brand for its taste. As a side note about sea salt, I have suffered migrains all of my life and after getting rid of table salt and switching to sea salt 40 years of migrains vanished.  I must have needed some type of mineral that is in natural sea salt, I am guessing. Table salt is stripped of all minerals and has additives for its preservation while shipping which is something our bodies don't need anyway!"
5.0,DEEEEElicious.,"Little did I know that this product was that special. Well, it IS. I'm so glad I ordered more than one package. Patting myself on the back."
1.0,No thanks,"Thought I would give it a try since we love the velveeta shells and cheese.  This is NOT a good meal at all. The ""pasta"" was like thick, thick rice pieces that once it was in your mouth it felt as though you were eating bugs, I've never had a pasta with that shape and texture before.  The ""broccoli"" was dried powder. The kids didn't like this meal nor did my husband and I.  I think Velveeta should just stick with their shells and cheese."
1.0,Does Not Work,I soaked my plants with the spray and it had zero effect. Racoons must love spicy food. Save your money.
5.0,"Certified Organic, Made in the USA quality dog food","Nature Organics makes certified organic high quality dog food that is made in the USA.  My dog absolutely loves it!  The first ingredients are organic chicken, water, organic carrots, and organic peas.  What's not to like?"
1.0,Not as good as it seems,We are really disappointed. We tried different ways to get the food done..at first smaller pieces then more time steaming but none of them worked out. Even when you cut the food in very small pieces it takes forever to get  it done. Now we are back to the old way and it takes even less time than baby brezza. Too bad we spent a good amount of money in something that it does work.
1.0,disappointed customer,"I ordered this variety pack thinking that i was about to get all the many different chips that i been dreaming about while im in afghanistan but when my variety pack came in(which it was about a week & a half later) i open the box to find that the company sent me the wrong variety pack. The company sent me the frito lay count variety pack, which i didnt ask for and which it only cost $14.57, now even though that is only a $1.03 difference, the reason for me ordering this particular package was because it has 7 different kinds of chips in it. Now the one the company sent me only has 5 different kinds. I was very upset about this. I was so upset that i didnt even try to return the chips back because i knew that would be an even longer process. I dont think ill be buying these chips again."
5.0,PERFECT PRESENT!!!,I bought this gift for my 3 year old nephew who absolutely loves the wizard of oz.. this was the first present he opened and didnt open anything else! he played with this for over an hour filling all the characters! Awesome gift!
1.0,Fits nicely into kong,It fits nicely into Kong and keeps Dasher busy. However Dasher vomitted after eating it. Not sure whether he's not used to this new treat.
5.0,Great Customer Service from Seller,"I am editing an original review that I wrote upon initial receipt of this item.  Unfortunately, it arrived damaged and I was very disappointed with what I perceived to be a quality issue.  I contacted both the seller, and I was greeted with a prompt email response.  Even though it was only a few days before Christmas, I received a replacement item in time to wrap and place beneath the tree, and it was absolutely perfect.  The box is really lovely, and the salts smell wonderful.  The gift recipient was very pleased as well. It was so nice to see excellent customer service in action, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this company and product to everyone looking for an interesting and unique gift for the gourmand in their life."
5.0,Sweet and delicious,"This is a delicious, smooth, sweet mustard that's perfect for anyone who wants a higher honey-to-mustard ratio than many mustards. If you like quite a bit of zip in your mustard, keep looking, because this is fairly mild."
1.0,No Habla Espanol,I guess it does the job okay.  And it's much cheaper than 5-Hour brand.  But the packaging it arrived in was in Spanish.  Since I don't speak or read Spanish I was a little leery of this item since it was impossible for me to read ingredients and nutritional information panel. The item is labelled as being made in the USA but the website on the label has a .mx extension for being a Mexican company. I don't have anything against our neighbors to the south.  I just expect that when I buy something on Amazon that the labeling will be in English unless otherwise stated.
1.0,Seeds didn't sprout as expected,"Bummer. It's coming up to 2 months and the mint is the only strong herb growing but even then isn't as strong or abundant as expected. A few others have grown sparse sprouts that aren't strong enough to survive gentle watering. The rest didn't grow at all. They have all the right conditions, great sun and drainage and soil but I guess with seeds you never know, but my batch seemed to be duds."
1.0,Defective K-Cups from Timothy's,"I LOVE Timothy's Colombian Decaf. It is the best tasting Decaf out there. However, I have struggled repeatedly with DEFECTIVE K-Cups from Timothy's. For some reason water will not go through the K-Cup resulting in a cup full of coffee grounds. I have tried the Timothy's K-Cups in 3 different Keurig Coffee Makers and Timothy's is the only one with this issue. I have found this problem with more than 50% of the K-Cups I have purchased. Thankfully Amazon gave me a full refund for the DEFECTIVE Timothy Cups (all 4 cases). If you don't mind crunchy/chewy coffee, then Timothy's Decaf is for you...if not then you are going to be like me...looking for a tasty alternative Colombian Decaf from another manufacturer. Considering the high cost per cup of K-Cups in general, I cannot afford to continue to be Timothy's guinea pig due to their lack of QA/QC."
5.0,Great Snack from Amazon.com !,"I love the Kind bars. They are GLUTEN FREE and an awesome snack that can be carried in a purse, pocket, and/or in the glove box of the vehicle."
5.0,VERY FLEXIBLE,"IN THE PAST I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNATURE ON DELIVERY AND IT MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE PACKAGE.  BUT AFTER PLACING MY ORDER WITH THE COMPANY THIS TIME, I CALLED AND I ASKED THE WOMAN IF SHE COULD HAVE THE PKG DELIVERED WITH NO SIGNATURE.  AND SHE SAID THEY COULD DO THAT.  I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED  WHEN SHE SAID THAT.  AND SO WHEN THE PKG ARRIVED IT SAID ON THE LABEL, LEAVE NO SIGNATURE.  SO THAT MADE IT A VERY PLEASANT AND CONVENIENT EXPERIENCE.  THANK YOU"
5.0,Clear Jel is for me!,I tried Clear Jel for the first time a few weeks ago to can peach pie filling.  I turned out great.  I made a pie out of one of the jars and everyone loved it.  Today my friends are coming over to can apple pie filling.  I'm sure it will be just fine. I've been canning for almost 40 years and am pleased so far with Clear Jel.
5.0,Love it!,"I have tried all the brands of almond flour that amazon sells. Honeyville is the best product, and the best value. I have baked cakes, pancakes, made cookies and muffins. Love it!"
1.0,nasty,"i thought this would be a great tasting drink. i got it for my kids because my kids love blueberries. it also had less sugar and calories, but was  i wrong my kids spitted the drink out right away. the mint is real strange flavor and very nasty"
1.0,Ehh,"I wasn't expecting much smoking these, simply because I'd heard that flavored papers weren't so great. I would definitely not recommend these. Honestly, I didn't taste any of the watermelon at all, just bad rolling paper which made the ""herb"" taste very bad. The papers are also very thick which contributed to the bad burning."
1.0,"Product is fine, price isn't",Love all of Devinci free syrups but you can buy them on DeVinci's web-site for $8.00 a bottle. I think it's a shame how much some people think they can get away with charging for things....$16 a bottle is robbery!
1.0,mars,these were european mars which are apparently milky way bars so i wasnt thrilled and also they arrived completely melted ooooops
5.0,The Best Ever,My Family has been using this seasoning for years & we love it. We are creole originally from louisiana and could only find the seasoning from cajunsupermarket.com or from a great-uncle shipping it to us from louisiana. It cannot get any better once u taste it.............
1.0,"new package, new taste","I've been ordering these coffee for awhile now.  It's not very strong, but okay.  I noticed the new package from my last order.  it's not as pretty, but that's just the package (so, I thought).  Unfortunately, not only the packaging is different, but the coffee is different too.  It doesn't even taste like coffee.  I thought maybe it's just a bad batch, but when i opened another pack it still tasted BAD...yuk!!!  I'm so done with this coffee."
5.0,YUMMY,"I have been baking with Virginia Dare Pure Anise Oil for years especially at holiday times and being of Italian decent I grew up with that wonderful aroma through the house and now my kids are enjoying it. I prefer pure anise oil to extract any day it smells stronger and I use less amounts.  ""Happy Baking"""
5.0,Good HOT chip,"These are HOT chips, but they are so good.  If you are looking for some spicy chips these are really good.  If you can't take the heat don't try these without a cut of milk(milk will cool your mouth fast)."
5.0,Ultimate Chocolate Space Brownies,I would have too say this would be the best chocolate mix brownie i have ever ate. It has real chocolate and i usually bake it with cannabis and its a delightful treat.
5.0,Fantastic Product!!!,"Flavor-doh is the most amazing product I have ever used! I learned about it through my vet. I was having a terrible time getting my pomeranian to take his meds. This is simply amazing! I use the handle of a spoon, scoop out a small portion and simply roll it in my hands with the meds. The meds end up rolled in a neat little ball! He absolutely loves taking his meds now! I was thrilled to find I could order this online,which is much less of a hassle and less expensive too! He loves the chicken. My vet ran out of it and I tried beef, no go. I have used this for several years. I used to dread pill time, now he looks forward to it! He actually sits by the kitchen island every morning waiting for his ""treat""!!!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
5.0,Yummy Great when you are not having sugar, MarketSpice Teabags 50 Pack What a great product when you are eliminating sugar from your diet. It is sweet without any artificial sweeteners and very satisfying
1.0,Leaky Items,There is a problem with the way the manufacturer attaches the spouts to the actual box of coconut water.  There is always one box out of the six pack that is leaking.  Today the coconut water was leaking through the actual box it came in.  I am cancelling my Subscribe and Save to this product.
1.0,Not just honey!!,After receiving a very timely shipment I also was very dismayed to find out that I cannot use this honey powder because it contains wheat.  I had specifically checked the ingredients before purchasing; saying it is powdered honey is not accurate -- that's not the only ingredient!
1.0,This Needs Discontinued,This was probably the WORST soup I've ever had. I made it earlier today thinking it couldn't be that bad. Who can mess up tortellini? Well I ate one bite and just couldn't do the rest. Gag. The tomato base is DISGUSTING! The 4 tortellini are sooo gross. Seriously whoever let this be released has no taste buds whatsoever. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
5.0,San Francisco Bay coffee k-cups,The lowest price I could find for k-cups and still tasted delicious!!! K-cups fit my Kuerig and deliver the same results!  I tried several flavors and everyone is true to taste.  I will order again!! Why pay more for the exact same flavor as the other brands??
1.0,Sucks,"I eat all kinds of cheap stuff (including other Chef Boyardee products).  I also eat a lot of mac&cheese, from cheapo generic box dinners to higher quality made-from-scratch real stuff.  But this is the worst I have ever eaten.  It drips and tastes like the nacho cheese sauce at Target's food counter.  Barf."
5.0,Great Tasting Potato CHIPS.,The potato chips are wonderfully tasty.  My sons and I both like the Rosemary and Olive Oil because it is not as spicy.  We also got the Jalapeno.  It is not so much I don't like the Jalapeno.  It is spicy hot for me.  I still love the potato chips.
1.0,Nasty crap.,"I have trouble believing that what is in the package is truly dried fruit.  Dried poop maybe?  These are downright awful - the smell, the texture, the smell, the taste, oh and did I mention the smell.  I have smelled outhouses and mall bathrooms that are more appealing."
1.0,"Ugh, nasty, mushy olives","I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora's olives are much, much better."
1.0,Completely useless,It takes tons of effort for little gain and only makes an ultra-fine powder that drifts away if you use over food. Bought off feebay but thought i'd pass on the warning.
1.0,Bad Container,"So the salt is fine, but the poorly designed ""cylinder"" is not very sturdy and today, while pouring some salt into a soup I was making.. the lid came apart from the canister and poured the whole container into my soup... obviously ruining it.  Buy something else and save yourself the hassle.  It also CAME complete clumped up..."
1.0,Misleading Labeling,"As a rule, you should always check the fine print of anything you buy and not the BIG BOLD LABEL that says ALL NATURAL or FAT FREE or NO ADDED SUGAR. The marketing strategy was not for those who are looking to buy the creamy, easy to spread peanut butter nor for those who wants no partially hydrogenated oils in their PB. But it is for those who wants ""All Natural"" those who thinks they are just buying all peanut, all healthy, no saturated fats PB. Others are saying they dont care whats in it as long as it's creamy and tasty and their kids love it but this review is not about the taste. We already know that Skippy products are tasty and creamy and yes my kids loves PB for breakfast. Im sorely reviewing about product labelling. All Im saying is theres nothing special about it. They could have just said, its PB without PHO. But again, it's all about strategy and consumers like us really needs to educate ourselves."
5.0,Definitely a keeper,It is so easy to bake and delicious. I baked 2 loaves on Friday and it was gone by Sunday. I added 1 cup of golden raisins in addition to nuts. But it is overpriced here because I bought the 2-loaf kit for only $5 at Walmart.
5.0,These are a keeper,I bought my first box of the dried cherries recently and they are excellent. This morning I used my raisin bread recipe and made cherry bread by substituting the raisins (omit the cinnamon) and the loaf tastes wonderful. I could make these and give them as gifts. The flavor sparkles and I am very pleased. I will continue to buy these cherries from Traverse Farms.
1.0,Never underestimate the power of these brownies.,"I do not know what is in these brownies to cause these reactions, but hear and heed my warnings. I wish I'd read the truth, the naked truth, the unvarnished and ugly truth:  1 Brownie - strange tummy rumbles. Sounds like thunder. Caution, you want to be near the plumbing fixtures.  2 Brownies - Thunder, plus the most unexpected gastro warnings. Think a high wind on the Sahara. You might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom. Start practicing your prayers.  3 Brownies - You should just make your bed in the bathtub. You'll be there all night.  More than 3 Brownies: The refrain: ""Dear God in heaven"" is heard echoing against the porcelain."
1.0,Did not receive Product,"I'm unable to review product, but surely can say that Barry Farm is not the easiest place to work with.  Perhaps it's just the Holiday jitters.  Postal Service notified me they received empty package from the order I placed with them several weeks ago.  I thought it'd be an easy matter to handle, but after not hearing back, I called Barry Farms, and was greeted with rudeness from person answering the phone.  She told me I was talking over her as I tried to briefly explain the situation.  Having paid only $2.69 for a product that cost $7.80 to ship, I was not satisfied with their customer service, and since the company told me this happens sometimes, perhaps they need to readjust their packaging methods."
1.0,500 OSTRICH FERN Matteuccia Struthiopteris Seeds Spores,"I wish I could review this product, but I ordered it a month ago and never received it. I wrote the company. They had no tracking information. If I ever receive it, I will update this review."
1.0,What a rip off! Ferry-Morse Organic Catnip Seeds are No Good!,"I've grew the catnip in the past and had never experienced any problems. But this time was different... I've ordered Ferry-Morse Organic Catnip Seeds and planted half of them indoors. Same gardening process as I used in the past. However, the catnip seeds didn't germinate. I've tried again, and still nothing. What a rip off!"
1.0,terrible packaging,I paid for 6 cannisters - only two arrived in tact. The rest were dented so badly that the powder was spillling outside of the packing box. What a waste of product and money!!!
1.0,keurig,"I was not happy with the selection of k-cups that were sent.I expected to receive regular coffee k-cups but wound up getting seasoned coffee mixes, tea, and cocoa. We are coffee drinkers and we gave away more that half of the order. Will not order this item again."
1.0,Buy it from another place.,First off I want to say that I love Malt-O-Meal its great but do not buy from this seller they completely rip you off with the shipping which is about the same price as the product. If you want to buy some Malt-O-Meal go to http://mybrands.com/Product.aspx?pid=3866 not only is the product cheaper the shipping is reasonable.
5.0,Dog Treats,My little Shih Tzu loves her treats...one in the morning and 1 at night.  These are very healthy organic treats..Only the best for my Dog.
1.0,You would be insane to purchase from here,"I have no idea why anyone would pay $13.50 from a second hand place when for $6.00, you can purchase from the manufacturer Nespresso, directly. Am I missing something here?"
1.0,Aweful,"Ordered the Gallopin Pepper, stated it was no-carb, it isnt, and decided to try it, it tasted ""musty"" not tender and the taste really funky.  My dogs love jerkey, and one wouldnt touch it.  Was dissapointed."
5.0,Hubby LOVES it,"He is simply wild over this stuff.  Uses to make homemade hot mustard chex mix...on popcorn...not even counting all the other random uses he finds.  Too hot for me (but I am a wimp when it comes to ""hot"" foods....but if you like the heat, you will love it."
5.0,love it,love this pineapple. taste super good. havent found anything better than this. some of the pineapple in certain bag are softer. But overall they taste awesome
1.0,Sugar & Corn Syrup,"What they do not tell you on this product description that sounds oh so healthy and doable for my daughter on the specific carb diet for a medical condition...is that it's not JUST honey and sesame seeds, but sugar AND corn syrup as well.  Because one sweetener wasn't enough they needed to throw in 2 more for good measure.  This might be tasty, I'll never know bc I'm sending it back, but it's no better than eating any cheapo candy off the grocery store aisle."
5.0,childhood memory,"We like to put this in our lemonade, water, our cocktails and even beer. It's a French Tradition!"
5.0,It's bitter. And lemon. And I love it.,"I love this lemony tonic both on its own and with gin. The cost is high, but it's a worthwhile splurge for me.  It's definitely for those who like bitter notes, and it's less cloyingly sweetened than some of your standard tonic waters. I tried adding a dash of bitters to a Bitter Lemon G&T, and it was too much - I take that to mean that Fever Tree's recipe is just right. A fresh mint or basil leaf doesn't hurt, though.  I like their tonic also, but the lemon is really something special. I even asked for it for Christmas :)"
5.0,Where Have You Been All My Life?,"These were fantastic. My wife and kids loved them and we quickly polished off the package--within a few days. What is nice is that they are not too heavy. You can eat a few for enjoyment, but don't find yourself too stuffy or full. And it seems there is a perfect blend of fudge and peanut butter, where neither overwhelms the other. My wife and daughter are chocolate lovers, but they enjoyed the nice blend with peanut butter. I'm more of a PB guy, but I enjoyed the mix with chocolate. We love these and will continue to purchase them."
1.0,No taste then after taste,"I was looking for some apple snacks and read the good reviews on this brand so bought a 24 pack. I just received them today, opened up a package and I am enormously disappointed. They are crunchy, as the package said, but this is where the good points end. They do not have a very strong apple taste, in fact my first thought was 'burned' something. I don't know why but this was how it tasted to me. Also, after each bite, there is a mildly bitter after taste. I have tried several dried apple products and have never experienced a bitter after taste until this product. I am very sorry to have wasted so much money on so many of them. For anyone who still wants to try them, I will give you a tip - they are sold elsewhere on Amazon.com in a package of 12 instead of the 24 sold here. 11 would have been a lot easier to get rid of than 23. :("
1.0,"nasty, disgusting!","this gum is nasty, then it turns to a nasty gooey blob after 30mins of chewing it, then it turns to liquid and the taste is bitter and even nastier it's gross!  by bottle of sour apple pucker taste better straight up in a shot glass than this nasty mess!"
5.0,Cornnuts vs driving buying 24 cornnuts!,Buying in bulk: Im not going to what one flavor. Im eating a classic stack in 4 flavors; Wow.. Do stores have chili picante and nocho?
1.0,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! BUYER BEWARE,I am very disappointed. I did not receive any sleepy time tea yet they sent me African Rooibos. I don't even like African Rooibos. The picture makes you believe you will receive a minimum of 7 cups of the 5 teas shown in the picture. Hopefully Amazon will rectify this. I received the same as the person below me...I wish I would have read the below review prior to my purchase.  NO SLEEPY TIME TEA 3 Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger 7 Bigelow Mint Medley 7 Twinings African Rooibos 8 Celestial Seasoning Mandarin Orange 9 Twinings Pure Camomille
1.0,Open Bags on arrival !! Check every one!,"7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...  This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.  I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online."
5.0,"Splendid product, exceeded my expectations",Grove Square hot chocolate is very tasty.  I was searching for The Swiss Miss brand and the search pulled up this one. The price was right so I ordered some with hopeful expectations and was pleasantly surprised at Grove Squares wonderful chocolate creamy taste even on the large cup Koerig setting. You won't be disapointed
1.0,"Good taste, horrible delivery","I ordered this item for myself and it arrived very quickly.  The flavor is good if not a little sweet.  I liked it so much that I wanted to order for my sister in law. Placed the order and selected next day delivery to surprise her.  Well, that did not happen.  I would have at least expected a heads up from the supplier that next day delivery was not going to happen.  I am very disappointed!!"
5.0,Sweet,"Personnaly, I don't care for soft cookies; however my wife loves them...so I got these for her...when queried, she said...not bad...not bad at all...so...wifey gives these cookies a two thumbs up...she still perfers oreos, but these are a very close second."
1.0,Weak flavor!!,This used to be the bomb back in the day...hot and flavorful.  Now they are weak.  And splintery!
5.0,Best make-at-home coffee ever,"BJ's Brewhouse started serving Douwe Egberts coffee a few years ago.  I loved it so much, I went online looking for a way to purchase it for home.  It turns out, Douwe Egberts partnered with Phillips to create the Senseo coffee pod system for the sole purpose of marketing their coffee to the United States.  This is the most remarkable coffee I've ever been able to make at home.  It's restaurant quality, and Amazon has the best deal on the pods.  Especially now that they offer the subscription program."
1.0,Disappointed,Extremely disappointed. I trusted the brand and got a 4-pack. But this product is just too sweet. And there are barely any raisins in them. I would rather go for any in-house brand (like Ralphs) and get a better cereal than this. This cereal is very unhealthy.
1.0,nonsoluable,"i have no doubt the contents are valuable, but since i cant mix then with anything liquid, what good are they? they should be offered in optional capsule form as this stuff just doesnt dissolve and is very grainy..."
5.0,Mixes taste AMAZING!!,"Absolutely the best food allergen free product on the market that my family has tried. The only mixes we will use. My daughter is gluten,dairy, nut, and egg free. Bakes excellent with replacements like flax seed for egg and rice milk for dairy."
5.0,Starts my day every day,"This tea is the first cup I have in the morning.  Follow the directions with almost boiling water and a 5 minute steep.  I have not been successful using a bag more than once, however. A little stevia intensifies the flavor.  I always order an extra box so I never run out, a problem since I am often giving some to friends."
1.0,Warning : liver treats,"These are freeze dried duck liver treats; the description does not say that. I bought them thinking it was duck meat, similar to the freeze dried chicken. Nowhere in the description is liver mentioned. My dog hates liver."
5.0,Everything grows,"No mess, No fuss.  Herbs grew great with no effort. Quiet and trouble free."
1.0,Mush right out of can,"Like many, I use to sway between Starkist and Bumblebee brand tuna because it was the easily available brand at grocery stores.  However, once i discovered Polar brand tuna - that's the only one i go to. See the pictures i posted! I just dumped the Starkist one out on a plate and it deflated into mush. The Polar one stayed FIRM chunks!  MW Polar Foods All Natural Chunk Light Tuna, 6-Ounce (Pack of 48)   It's a little bit pricier but SO WORTH it!"
1.0,Mediocre.,"If you are into High Fructose Corn Syrup baking,then, this tiramisu is for you.The product is dry and tastes like old desert made with ordinary ingredients. Totally disappointing,totally Unrecommended."
1.0,"5/24 K-Cups were NOT ""caffeinated coffee""","I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this purchase.  The product description indicates a variety of caffeinated coffees and five (5) of the 24 k-cups in each of the two (2)  were for cider drinks, iced coffee and DEcaffeinated coffee.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  Twenty percent (20%) of the coffee I received is not what was described and not what I wanted.  I won't buy from this seller again."
5.0,Simple. Quick. Cheap.,Pumpkin Delights are the best product Little Debbie offers and they arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
1.0,bleh.,"It reminded me of cheap Kool-Aid, and it took about seven shots to get anything that looked like tea, or tasted like it. By that time, the taste of lemon was just a tad too strong to really enjoy it. While the tea flavor was too fake tasting, the others might actually be alright. I'll happily take my real sweet tea over this any day of the week."
5.0,Breakfast Staple at a Better Price,"About the cereal: Uncle Sam is a plain, healthy cereal with lots of fiber from whole wheat and some essential fatty acids (healthy fat) from flax seeds. It has no added sugar and very little naturally occurring sugar, making it a good choice for anyone watching his/her sugar intake. It definitely takes some chewing if you eat it dry or right after adding your milk/non-dairy milk but the flakes get very mushy and the flax seeds absorb some liquid quickly so unless you like soggy you want to eat right away! There isn't a great deal of flavor here so I like to use a vanilla almond or coconut milk with it or even pair it with some fruit. My 5 stars isn't as much for the flavor as for the nutritional content but it is still a good cereal!  About the price: I have yet to find a store selling Uncle Sam for a lower or even comparable price to the one you pay if you buy this from Amazon with subscribe and save! My mom and my sister both eat plenty of this cereal so I am very happy to have it delivered by Amazon at a great price every few months; I always have a stash of it in my cupboard for when family is here!"
1.0,stained carpet,The liver product stained the beige carpet.  I would not recommend this flavor. We have tried all kinds of stain remover but to no avail.  Save yourself a lot of head aches and a major problem with ruining your carpet.
1.0,Disappointing,"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.  I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.  I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good."
1.0,Quite possibly the worst lefse' ever made!,"This lefse' isn't even worth one star, but that was the lowest Amazon would let me go.  There is no flavor to it what-so-ever.  You can't taste the potatoes or the butter, all you taste is flour and it's very dry.  It used to be better years ago when it slightly resembled the taste of potatoes, but as it is with many items, they must have found ways to save a buck at the expense of the quality & flavor.  Don't waste your money!  You're better off investing in the equipment to make your own, or finding a website that sells an authentic ""home-made"" variety.  I grew up in a Scandinavian household that made traditional lefse' for family gatherings, trust me when I say Mrs Olson's is absolutely horrible."
5.0,Good solution for dry hair - easy to open...too easy!,"My spouse has dry hair so this was his first bottle to try out and he absolutely loves this shampoo! However - and this is a big one for me - the fragrance is VERY strong. I find it overpowering. My spouse LOVES IT and since he is the one using this particular dry hair formula, it's okay except when he first gets out the shower. Of course, that is personal preference but if you are sensitive to fragrances, keep this in mind before purchasing the product.  There was one problem with these shampoo/conditioners - about half arrived with the top open in a big yucky mess. Fortunately, Amazon had wrapped them inside the box which contained the shampoo in the plastic but otherwise, it would have been a giant mess with about 1/4 of the entire bottle squeezed out. The same issue that made them pop open in shipping does make them convenient for use in the shower.  Last but not least, despite the additional of vitamins/supplements to enhance the product, I've been moving aware of many of the other harsh ingredients/chemicals contained in this/other shampoo's and conditioners. I did NOT deduct a point for it because once again, that is a lifestyle related choice.  Bottom Line - a good product for dry but those with sensitivities to fragrance will want to think twice."
1.0,Warning! Product of China. FDA warning!,Shameful that this company continues to sell products that are under FDA warnings. Does anyone think for a second that these are organic and cage free and we are t.o just take a Chinese company's word for it? With NO government regulations. Yea right.
1.0,waste of money,"This product was definately a waste my money.  It certainly didn't taste like butter and had no buttery taste to it, which is what the claim is.  I guess that is why they have the six (6) pack purchase because they know this stuff isn's worth it.  Also, feel that they are trying to get rid of this stuff. If I could return this it would certainly be in the mail by now for a refund. terrible buttery popcorn topping.  If you have taste buds you will be dissappointed."
5.0,Cats are happy,"Product was exactly as ordered. Cats are happy with their food. I'm quite thrilled with the convenience and price, particularly with Prime."
1.0,Not received,This item was not received.  I just realized that when I received your request for an review.  Please look into it
1.0,Check the information,I did not use this product after researching it and finding it could cause a false positive on a drug test.  I could not find what type of test they are using but some of the jobs I currently have applications in for use hair tests and did not want to take the chance.
5.0,Cet hextra,"Love the product. The wife gives me one every night....if I'm a good boy.If not, I go to bed with plaque:("
1.0,"NEW RECIPE, NOT THE SAME COOKIE","Dare changed their recipe, they are now called ""Chocolate Creme"".  I contacted Dare they told me, they changed the box to make it more environmentally friendly and it's the same cookie because it has the same product number. I've been eating this cookie for 30 years, I know what it tastes like, these new ones taste like 'Oreos'.  VERY DISSAPOINTED."
5.0,hard to find,"hard to find Altoids, easy purchase and order enough for great shipping. Gave this as a gift for that hard to buy person. Great long lasting taste."
1.0,I did not receive my order,"I placed my order through Amazon and after about 10 days inquired about my order because it had not shipped.  I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled. No explanation at all, just that it had been canceled. I checked back on Amazon and see that this item is still available but they had raised the price.  So instead of honoring the price they just blew me off like the sale never happened.  Shame on Amazon for allowing a seller to do this.  Bottom line, Amazon has gone down a few points in my eyes.  Greedy Starbucks can keep their coffee."
5.0,these taste great,I've always been a fan of licorice bears.  These are perfect--salty and dense.  You really can't tell that they are sugar free.
1.0,WHAT A DISASTER!,I should have believed the other reviewers! When I opened the box the bag that the chocolate was in was torn open and the chocolate coins were scattered all over the box! I was very disappointed! This was a gift and there was no way that I could give this to anyone! There is no way that the outer bag ripped inside the sealed box. This ccompany needs to check out what is going on with who is packing the boxes that are being shipped out!
1.0,I cannot believe I just paid $17.95 for a bag of chips (crushed chips!),"Clearly I need to brush up on my math skills. I ordered the Riceworks brown rice crisps assuming the $17.95 price was reflective of a bulk purchase - because who in their right mind would pay $17.95 for ONE BAG OF CHIPS. But - sadly - no, the $17.95 was reflective of one 16oz bag of chips. No, really - it is/was. To add to this purchasing disaster, the chips were completely crushed resulting in a price average of .10/chip crumb. It's *almost* funny."
1.0,Not a fan of this at all.,I bought this thinking it would be kind of like kool-aid. It's not. It was more like adding flavor to water and the flavor was very weak.
1.0,Like eating greasy wax - no flavor,"After seeing the girls that started the business on Shark Tank I wanted to support them and also I LOVE peanut butter so I ordered the 5 pack special they were running at the time.  I had a tasting party with a bunch of friends all looking forward to trying all the flavors.  Not one person liked the product or was even able to swallow it after putting it in their mouth.  The taste was so bad and the greasy texture such a turn off that my guests were actually spitting the peanut butter into napkins.  I called the company and was told that the product needed to be refrigerated and then STIRRED. I has already stirred the peanut butter when we opened the containers due to the oils being on the top, which is normal with natural peanut butters. Seriously stirring cold peanut butter is not possible, nor can it be spread on bread.  Save your money - I am out over $60 for the Wild Squirrel Nut Butters and they all had to be thrown out.  These girls said all their friends at college love the nut butters, too bad your friends didn't tell you the truth and save you and my guess is your parents loads of money getting this product to market."
5.0,Can you say Queso?,"Great product and really fast delivery.  I use this ofetn in many dishes for that extra kick.  Some find it a little hot, but I think it is great for queso, and other Mexican style dishes."
5.0,This stuff is great!,"The red quinoa is much nuttier than the regular white quinoa.  It reminds me of miniature popcorn, and is quite tasty made with chicken broth.  Don't overcook!"
1.0,Bitter after taste,"I am a hard core coffee lover, but have been having trouble with the caffeine so have decided to to try and find a good decaf.  I thought this might be the one but I was sorely let down.  The coffee smells pretty good but once brewed it has a very bitter slightly acidic after taste.  I even tried mixing it half and half with my other coffee but could STILL taste the bitterness.  Needless to say I have it sitting on my shelf and neither my sister nor I will be drinking it."
5.0,Great value,"It seems like I am buying vanilla constantly - and the real stuff isn't cheap. I was delighted to find that Amazon carries this huge size for such a reasonable price. Same great vanilla, more convenience, better price. What could be better!"
1.0,"I second the other ""Terrible"" review","When I went to my local QFC in Seattle, I was pressed for time to get to a memorial function, so when I found they only had this product and no powdered wasabi, I gave it a try.  I was bringing a smoked fish plate, and I wanted to make a wasabi mayonnaise to accompany the other usual sides for this appetizer.  Interesting that the other ""terrible"" review said it tasted like it was blended with mayonnaise. Obviously, I WANTED it to taste like wasabi mayo, which I've made many times with excellent results, and why not? It's just wasabi and mayo!!!  When I whipped this batch up at the function, it tasted excessively salty, almost like baking soda, which rendered it unservable. Lucky I had other condiments so no huge deal.  I know I've used pre-made in the tube in the past, but this brand was truly awful. So, people, learn from my mistake: buy powder, add hot water, you're done-enjoy!"
5.0,UN-AMERICAN SNICKERS,"Just got my shipment from Premier Life.   Nice and fresh and good speed for international delivery,   These Snickers from England have different ingredients.   Definitely a more peanut-buttery flavor.   Sweetness tastes more like sugar than corn syrup.   Cannot tell for sure as there is no ingredient list on the labels.   A truly delightful variation on Yankee Snickers."
5.0,Kitty's Garden Edible Grass Planter,"This is a great idea, well made box, and it's just perfect!  I originally started out looking for some grass seeds for my kitties since they love to munch on EVERYTHING- not to mention I always have to move flowers so they can't reach them for their safety and the plants. When I saw this I thought it was the cutest box I had ever saw then I remembered it wasn't for me rather the cats! I felt the box alone was worth the price so I ordered it.  When I opened the package I was highly surprised at how ""real"" the planter felt, not cheap like most things you buy. That had partially won me over already- the quality, but then I saw the handwriting printed on it and what do you know? It looks great! It has oats- wheat- rye- barley written across the top and kitty's garden below it.  The planter itself consists of the wood box (of course), an open plastic container for catching water, and a plastic container with four sections to hold the seeds. The seeds drain and the wood stays nice, everyone's happy and wins.  The soil had me confused at first because I had no idea they now wrapped soil in netting, but they do! You remove the netting and place each soil pod into a single container and fill with 3/4(?) ounces of warm water and wait ten minutes for the soil to absorb the water. You then remove a teaspoon of soil from each container (keep it seperated) and place the seeds into the spot where the soil was removed then cover them- don't forget to remove the open container and empty the drained water from when the soil was soaking.  I planted the seeds two days ago and can already see sprouts so I expect them to be ready by next week or so. Basically, as I mentioned before the box is worth the buy. I can't really comment on the seeds since mine are growing and others had problems. However, you can always buy your own seeds and a small bag of soil that you know is trustworthy and just plant them in this awesome box!"
1.0,The Only Illy Not Worth the Money,"I love Illy's medium roast, dark roast, and decaff.  I don't know what happened with this blend, but it is flat-out nasty."
5.0,Guilty Pleasure,"I treat myself to these beans once a year. Excellent when ground up with Sumatra coffee beans. Right now, with the free holiday shipping, its even more of a bargin. Uber fast delivery too."
1.0,EVERY BOTTLE SEAL WAS BROKEN AND CAP OPENED,"WOW, I doubt I need to say more. I returned the product and won't by from them again."
5.0,"REAL licorice, soft and chewy","I've had this licorice many times over the years, although this is the first time I've bought it on Amazon.  The flavor is authentic and strong, since it contains real licorice root extract and molasses.  The texture is very soft and chewy, and it will stick to your teeth somewhat.  But I prefer it over artificially flavored, plasticky  American licorice like Twizzlers. Real licorice has health benefits, too!  It's high in iron, it's soothing to ulcers and coughs, it works as a mild laxative, and it has been proven to have anti-bacterial and anti-viral qualities.  It's not a candy you can sit and eat mindlessly - four large pieces contains 140 calories, 19 grams of sugar and 31 grams of carbs. Plus re-read the laxative part above.  But with licorice this rich and delicious, a couple of pieces is enough.  I think of Kookaburra licorice as candy for adults."
5.0,We just happen to love this candy.,"We received the package fine. I give some of these to others who also love this candy.  BIG BAG, good candy."
1.0,Yuck - tastes like rubbing alcohol,"I bought this extract to use in a pumpkin beer, but I would have ruined the batch. This stuff is gross!"
5.0,Great product!,The ordering experience was great and the product itself is fantastic! It tastes great and is really great as a frozen snack!
5.0,Hazelnut coffee--Gloria Jean's,"This is a good full bodied coffee, very enjoyable any time of the day or evening. I will always keep this brand on hand."
5.0,Sparkling!!,"I have really enjoyed this product. It's like OJ with a kick. It has a clear, fresh taste. It is a great thirst quencher. Izze satisfies that soda craving. This great stuff. I am anxious to try the other flavors."
5.0,Good Stuff!,My son is autistic and we are giving the gluten free diet a try. Had this pasta last night with some chicken and tomato sauce. It was yummy! My son even asked if we could have it again tonight. I hope the switch to gluten free contiues to go so well. I would recommend this pasta.
5.0,Baby's Favorite,"This stuff is delicious and is a hit with our baby! Interestingly, she doesn't like Pear and Mango from other brands. The packaging is fun to squeeze too."
1.0,Poor quality candy,"I am a dyslexia specialist who tutors children.  I ordered this candy to use as a reward for my students.  I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the candy.  It was hard and seemed stale.  It was so hard that my student could not bite it with his teeth, but had to use scissors!  The taste was also poor.  My fourth grade student spit it out!  He has enjoyed gummy bears and gummy worms, but would not eat this.  My seventh grade student ate one, with difficulty, and said they were really bad and not to bring any more. I thought perhaps it was stale, but the expiration date on the box said August 2012.  So I concluded that this is just very poor quality.  I threw the remainder in the trash."
1.0,Undrinkable,"After checking out the reviews, I decided to try King's Cupboard sugar-free hot chocolate. Although it was only available in a 3 pack of 8 ounce cans (and was over $35) the reviews made it look like a good deal.  Hardly.  Following the directions, and using filtered water, made for a completely undrinkable cup of hot chocolate. I tried milk, cream, a mix of water and cream, and even added sugar to see if it helped. The mix remained metallic tasting, and completely undrinkable."
1.0,no smell or taste of truffle at all,"This product says it is a truffle honey, but doesnt taste truffle at all. is came with some oil over it and doesnt taste truffle not even honey, Disgusting. Waste of money."
5.0,Saves Room!!!,We bought this for the office. We have our Keurig on top of a small refrigerator and so we need storage to store K-cups. So we bought this and it's great! It saves room and it just fits perfectly on the of the refrigerator.
1.0,Not post,"This is a very deceptive advertisement.  They claim it to be Post raisin bran and even show a picture of a box with a Post label on it.  The truth is that what you get has nothing to do with Post.  It is simply Kirkland raisin bran.  Post is nowhere to be seen on the box.  Just a heads-up, because if you're like me, you bought it thinking it was Post brand."
5.0,Delicious!!! Very nice on cold winter's day.,First time I have had a lentil vegetable soup and I was pleasantly surprised. This soup is delicious and makes a good soup for warming yourself up after being out in the weather. Will buy again.
1.0,Decaf??,Listing does not state that this is a decaffeinated tea.  Placed order and received 2 boxes of Twinings Earl Grey Decaffeinated k-cups.  Most definitely not what I wanted.
1.0,Nestles White Chips,"I love Nestles Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips, and only use those to bake my chocolate  chip cookies.  Everyone I bake for loves my cookies and says I bake better chocolate chip cookies than Mrs. Fields and Famous Amos combined. I have been baking for over 40 years.  I'd give the white chips a -5 if I could. I tried them when they first came out years ago.  I love white chocolate.  I would LOVE to find a good white chocolate chip.  This chip isn't anywhere close.  It had sort of a vanilla flavor instead - except it was more like Dollar Store imitation vanilla.  Nasty.  I tasted three chips and threw the rest of the bag away.  Don't waste your money."
5.0,Best buy,"Torani Sugar-Free is an established sugar free syrup in a wide variety of flavors.  They are delicious and the Amazon price is a nearly 30% discount from the regular price at various stores, including Walmart."
1.0,disappointed,"All of the Kraft Raspberry Vinegrette Dressing are very hot when they arrived due to the weather, not sure whether they are still edible. Very disappointed. :-("
5.0,Very tasty,"Great for on the go, I work in a job that I don't always got to eat lunch on time so grabbing a bar is a great way to eat. These are great, the only thing is that it comes in a 5 pack because 2 bars are in each pack. But it is still a great deal"
1.0,Yuck! I threw out the whole 5 lbs.,"First off these ""gummi"" apples don't have the gummi consistancy that haribo's other gummi candies have. They were so soft that they were like eating gum drops instead of a gummi product. I know what you are thinking, they were probably just really really fresh. No that wasn't it. I have purchased (and enjoyed) the haribo gummi sour cherries and they were very fresh when I received them but they still had the gummi texture that I was looking for. I had someone else try the candy just to see if they agreed with me and they said the same thing I do, that these aren't anything like gummies. I don't know... maybe I got a bag from some weird mutant batch and maybe they aren't always like this. Who knows.  The second thing is that the flavor is a bizarre apple-ish flavor that was not enjoyable in the least. It had kind of a chemical taste to it.  I absolutely do NOT recommend this product. Try the sour cherry, it is much, much better."
1.0,"Sorry, just didn't like it!","I usually love STASH teas, but this one is undrinkable.  I really tried to like it and tried it multiple times...yuck :(  It doesn't taste of chocolate, but rather some off-taste that's hard for me to define.  Unfortunately, you are forced to buy A LOT with this offer.  My suggestions is to try it first if possible."
5.0,love this stuff,"had this at a german market and had to order it for home! great on brats, burgers, and just about anything."
1.0,Loved it till i found i was eating beetles,In the ingredients it lists k-carmine. I was asked this question recently in a game and said no to some red food colors being made from beetles. Well I was wrong.  Yeah i researched it all and there's other ways to list it even just natural color. =(  I'm sorry if i ruined them for you like most people I have told. But its really nice to know whats going in your mouth. Shame on these people for calling it other names then crushed beetles!!  At least i have 1 relative that will still eat them he said. It's to bad this is about the only black licorice I liked. Now they are just to hard to swallow.
5.0,Just What I Wanted - So Good,I have been using my S&B Wasabi Paste every week. I like sushi. The paste is just what I wanted. Not watered down.
5.0,Delicious! These didn't last long in our house!,"These make the other peanut butter cups taste bad. Once you have the Newman's you'll never go back! The peanut butter is smooth and creamy and then covered in chocolate is amazing! These didn't last long in our house because everyone (including the kids) liked them so much. As a bonus, you can actually pronounce the ingredients. We've also had the dark chocolate peanut butter cups and those are just as good."
5.0,fresh and fair priced,"This was a pleasent surprise, for the gum is very fresh and you cannot beat the price.  If what we got is normal then by all means take advantage of their offer."
1.0,Had a burned taste,"I probably would have liked these very much except they are very brown and have a burned flavor.  Apparently since the other reviews were good, they have a problem with quality control.  I will not be buying again because I don't want to chance another box like these.  They have lost a customer who probably would have bought regularly had these not been overcooked."
5.0,Best salt & vinegar chips out there!,Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
1.0,"Dated Product, Questionable Packaging","I ordered this assuming it would be factory packaged and labeled, or at least arrive in an airtight container. Instead, I literally received a giant, plain brown Amazon box filled with loose Rigatoni, with no labeling, organic certification seal or any indication of its origin (how I do I really know it's Garden Time or even organic?), and nothing between it and the cardboard other than packaging tape, other than a thin bag that resembles a trash can liner. (Mine arrived badly ripped up; with half the pasta in the bag, half out.)  All in all, very odd, and unsettling. Even more worrying is the lone mark on the box was a stamp that stated it had been ""packaged on 3/3/10"" ... That's almost TWO YEARS before I ordered and received it. And, again, NOT in airtight packaging. Some of the pasta pieces literally looked dirty/dusty. Disgusting! Makes me deeply concerned about any and all food items I've purchased through Amazon."
5.0,"apparently, delicious",my cat is going to be morbidly obese. she loves this food so much it's almost dangerous to her health and my wallet. it looks and smells delicious. i would feel fine eating it myself. that's how wholesome and REAL it is. we get the dry food too- my cat is KING OF THE CASTLE. sigh..
5.0,Cheaper  at the stores......,"Good stuff, but it's cheaper at Walt-Mart and Smart and Final in Nevada for the 4 pack and 12 pack. So why buy it here?"
5.0,Rather true to form - right amount of sweetness,"First, I am a big fan of Arctic Zero.  The strawberry flavor is probably the truest to form taste-wise, as it really does take like strawberry ice cream.  It has the right amount of sweetness; whereas, for my taste, some of the other flavors do not.  Arctic Zero is like ice cream, but then it's kind of not like ice cream. It's very hard to explain, but there's more ice than cream to it, if you follow me. However, these are great, low-calorie treats, and you really can polish off a pint and not feel terrible about yourself!"
1.0,Wrong Product Description,I am very disappointed as I checked the description and it said 6.6 lb but I got a package for only 4 lb.. so it was not true and now I only have 4 lb instead of the 6.6 lb I was expecting so I do not recomend any body to buy this as you can receive something different.
5.0,Great,Really great bag of coffee. I picked a bag up from BJ's. I enjoy Dunkin Donuts coffee but drink this as well whenever I feel like grinding the beans. Its pretty strong stuff. Does not compare to crap like folgers or maxwell house.
1.0,"Great Packaging, Horrible Taste,  YUCK!!!","I was so excited for this to arrive because I LOVE Orgain drinks and this has two benefits over Orgain.  The first benefit is the drink is larger in size (15.9 oz versus 11 oz) and it has a twist off cap that you can put back on (which Orgain does not).  This unfortunately is where the benefits end for this product.  Orgain tastes SO much better and also has more vitamins in it.  I don't know if it is the soy milk or what, but the taste of this is absolutely horrible!  It is like a bad medicine after taste.  I purchased this because of all of the positive reviews on amazon and because of the packaging versus Orgain.  I was REALLY hoping this would be great, but I now have eleven containers of this stuff that I will never drink.  I cannot stress how bad this was to me, but maybe you will like it since so many others do.  I wish that I would have purchased an individual bottle before buying a whole case, but that was my own fault for not doing so.  Don't make the same mistake I did!"
1.0,Use the money as kindling for the fireplace instead,"One of the worst investments I have ever made. No fleas caught, but there is a bright side---it makes a great night light."
1.0,Fake tasting and sour,"I was SO excited to see the white Velveeta on Amazon. My hopes were that I had finally found a replacement for my hometown's delicious queso blanco dip that I cannot find on this side of the country. I happily spent the $16+ dollars on the only size (2 pack) that they had in stock, and greedily awaited the arrival of what I hoped to become a new tradition. Nope. Wrong.  The ""cheese"" was gummy, sour and plastic-y tasting. It wasn't even as good as it's orangey yellow sister, the regular Velveeta! So strong and off putting, that I threw it all in the trash. I was telling my aunt this story, and surprisingly she, a huge fan of the same restaurant chain, had this stuff, and had found it a dud as well. Serious bummer. So much potential, and such a disappointment."
1.0,Not sweet,"I was hoping this would be a sweet bread - but it is not.  It's thick and a bit doughy, but not the sweet taste that I typically expect when mixed with cinnamon.  I was very disappointed. I gave away all the unopened boxes to a food drive."
1.0,Not for me,I never used this type of coconut oil before. I'm not crazy about it. I would not recommend.
1.0,"Nasty, I can not recommend",The product that I purchased was soggy and greasy like it had been in the sun for awhile. It also tasted like it was rotten meat product. There is no use by or best by date on the package so I do not know how old it is either. I do not recommend this product.
5.0,Great cereal!,I have been eating this cereal for a couple of years now and I really like it. It has lots of fiber and great taste. I like buying it in the 3 big boxes and have it automatically delivered by Amazon. Very convenient.
1.0,Nestles,Thanks for the warning on the changes made by Nestles. One by one my favorite foods are being bought by foreign conglomerates. In the case of Nestles Switzerland restricts foreign ownership and to my mind there should be a quid pro quo and countries should ban Swiss companies buying up their companies. Rowntree was a successful company so it was not an issue of them struggling to survive.
5.0,Love it!,"I ordered this after reading other reviews and I'm so glad I did. I use it for everything! On pancakes and waffles, on my favorite salmon recipe, to sweeten my oatmeal. Grade b has more vitamins and minerals that are good for you. My only complaint is with the container, it's so messy; you always will have to clean it after every use. Anyways I order one bottle of syrup from Shady Farms which bottle seems to perform better and after I finish it I will be putting my Coombs syrup in it! Shady farms is overpriced in my opinion and Coombs Organic tastes great."
1.0,Didn't last a night,"I gave my Aussie a bone in the evening and he had it all chewed up in a couple of hours. That is way too much money to spend for such a short ""chew"" time. They are good bones, perhaps for a dog with less sharp teeth."
1.0,Low Quality,"I ordered these to take advantage of the subscribe and save discount, as finding tinned anchovies seems to be more difficult. Sadly, these are low quality anchovies that have many, many little bones that stick in your teeth, pierce your gums, etc."
1.0,Great Idea - Terrible Execution,"The idea of a popcorn bag that turns into a bowl is simply brilliant! I was sick of having to either get my hands covered with grease or clean the large bowl I'd dump my popcorn into. So I got these as soon as I saw them in the grocery store. Here are the problems; What's worse than a hot, oily paper bag? Very hot, oily PLASTIC. The plastic absorbs heat more than paper, and it's the part you're expected to pull off to get to the popcorn! Ouch! Burnt my fingers more than once, and when I didn't, had to wait and let it get cold-ish. The bowl is made of the same paper as the bag, and more flimsy, so you don't avoid getting grease everywhere. Unlike the bag, the bowl does not contain the popcorn. The popcorn reaches the very top of the bowl and falls out.  I'm going back to bags."
1.0,Hydrogenated!,Why would they make a hot chocolate that has trans fat in it????  So will not buy it.  Look for the word hydrogenated in the ingredient list.
5.0,good,if you like pickled things these are what your looking for i will be trying other brands to see how they stand up so far these are the best on amazon. 9 2 12
1.0,don't like strong smokey flavor and IT CAN'T BE RETURNED!!!,This coffee has a strong smokey flavor.  I do not care for it.  Now I am stuck with 3 pounds of it.  I thought it would be the same as another Papua New Guinea Organic coffee I have purchased before.  I am seriously disappointed that it can't be returned.  You should be aware of this before buying.  I just didn't realize it.
5.0,Pugsly Loves Lean Treats,"Our Vet gave us a free bag of Lean Treats and Pugsly loves them! The best part is that they are good for her, but we won't tell her. :-) The price on Amazon is much less than purchasing them at the Vets office and they are delivered to the door. 5 Stars!"
5.0,Good stuff with cream,"I'm amazed at the negative reviews here as Timothy's Kaluha has become one of our favorite K-Cups.  Both my wife and I drink our coffee with cream though, so maybe if you were just to drink it black you'd experience something different?  The only beef I have with K-cups (and this is in general, not just the Kaluha) is that they brew a much smaller cup than I'd like.  I almost always have to have at least two cups."
5.0,"Can you say ""Yum""?","Convenient, easy to carry along in my purse and the taste is really good.  I keep a few boxes at work in my desk and some at home.  Now if it can only go on auto-ship so I don't run out...."
5.0,great coffee,Just a little in the coffee gives it great taste with sweetness.  I use it all the time and the great thing is no more expensive vanilla coffee grinds.
5.0,Perfect Gift!,Quick delivery! Cohen is the happiest puppy in the world right now. These are his favorite treats and now my whole floor is filled with them! Thanks to this seller for being so quick and sending the nice plump ones that last a little bit longer!!
1.0,what's going on?,You advertise a significant price reduction but do not deliver. The orphans will be hungry because of you. You own me 4 and a half lbs.  Your published item weight says 5 pounds.
5.0,tasty,"I got a sample of this item at a food industry show and really enjoyed it. It is delicious and nutritious, a great way to start a cold morning. It is a nice touch that the pouch can be used for measuring the water."
5.0,wonderful product - expensive delivery,"I guess it was my fault I did not read the small print when buying the product, the expiration date was very near delivery date. Nevertheless, the product is great. I think 85 USD delivery cost for a 35 USD product was a bit too much, but it is worth it!"
1.0,"Same Soup, Expen$ive Packaging","This stuff is terrible! To begin with, the packaging is completely misleading. The hefty plastic cup appears very similar to other microwaveable convenience soups, pasta dishes, etc. on the market, but they are NOT microwaveable. To microwave, you must first dump the soup into a separate dish. The instructions further state to ""discard the container"" after opening, so I was not sure it would even be safe to store my leftover portion in it. Turns out I didn't need to worry about it, because the soup itself was certainly nothing special! Same old salty-yet-bland canned soup garbage that ALWAYS disappoints. I ate about 1/3 out of the bowl hunger, then dumped the rest once I felt like I could make it through to dinnertime.  I had bought several of these in preparation for returning to work after maternity leave because they seemed like a nice, convenient cold-weather lunch option. BIG mistake and BIGGER waste of money!!! I predict these will meet a swift end and you won't see them around much longer.  PS - The Campbell's Healthy Harvest Tomato Basil Soup (NOT The Kettle Cooked version, just regular canned) is very good, and my husband and I always keep it in the house. It's the only canned soup we like. I should have known better not to waste my money elsewhere."
5.0,My favorite peanut butter!,"I've always loved crunchy peanut butter, and of the types that I've tried I like this one the best. :) I'm not terribly educated on what makes this more ""natural"" than others, or whether it really is that good for you, but it does provide a protein punch and tastes amazing. Even my girlfriend, who swore she'd only eat Peter Pan classic creamy, eventually gave in and agrees that this stuff is the best of the best.  Here in Manhattan, it's also something like $3.99-$4.49 a jar; with this deal it comes out to something like $3.21 a jar, and we go through it pretty fast. :)"
5.0,The best tea ..... EVER,I'm a little wary to tell everyone how wonderful this tea is ... it might become hard to get.  It's perfectly named.  It's sweet and cinnamon spicy.  You'll never need any sweetener.  It's great hot and in the summer makes an awesome iced tea.  I've been buying and using it for a little over 2 years now and am so glad my daughter turned me on to it.
1.0,Tastes Like Coconut,"My company replaced the Keurig with a Flavia machine. Only good thing about this is that the lines at the machines are empty instead of 2, 3 deep.  Anyhoo---tried the French Vanilla. It's extremely weak and tastes overwhelmingly like coconut for some reason. I like coconut flavored things, but not my coffee.  Tried it twice, weeks apart. Same thing. Not a fluke."
5.0,excellent subtly smokey tea,"I make no claim to being a tea expert. I simply like to drink tea. This one makes a nice change. The flavor is gently smokey and smooth; one could call it lapsang for beginners :-). If you find you enjoy its gentle smoke then be daring and try lapsang souchong which is _very_ smokey indeed. Go easy on the amount, a little goes a long way, and give it a few minutes to fully unroll its leaves. Then enjoy!"
1.0,The WORST Stuff on the planet!  YUCK! This is NOT Chai!,I love Chai lattes and was hoping to find a good one that was both sugar free and caffeine free.  There aren't many options with these characteristics to choose from so I decided to give these packets a try and see if I had found my dream drink.  Oh no.  Not even close.  This is honestly the WORST stuff I have ever tasted!  It does NOT taste anything like Chai at all.  It's nothing but sickening sweet powdered vanilla syrup or something and not very good at that.  Do NOT bother with this if you are looking for Chai - it's not even on the same planet!
5.0,"Antioxidats, omegas, protien","This is a super food make no mistake about it. It is high in antioxidants, hight in essential omega fatty acids, and high in easily digestible plant protien. A tablespoon of this on your yogurt, cereal, smoothie, or stir fry will go a long way. I eat them by the spoonfull and would equate it to eating sesame seeds. They say that when the buddah was fasting he survived on just one hemp seed a day.  These seeds do not have THC as hemp is a different viriety of plant than cannabis. The seeds are sterilized upon import into the US, by law. These seeds are grown in Canada, whos food safety standards are at least equal to the US. These are also USDA certified organic.  A geat product. Nutiva is a good brand whos consistent quality I have come to trust. I love their 50%-protien hemp-protien too.  Hope that helps."
5.0,Bing Mixology,"I first bought Bing at a ""Loaf & Jug"" convenience store.  I liked the taste.  I don't get a kick from this like I do with Rockstar Sugar-free, but I think I'm sensitive to the artificial sweetners in the Rockstar which makes me feel more jittery than energized.  Bing is a mild energizer compared to other drinks, and doesn't really feel like a ""crash"" when it wears off.  Mixology:  I use 1 cup of frozen berries and one can of Bing to make a berry smoothie pick-me-up.  I really enjoy this, sometimes adding a splash of orange juice, lemon juice, or lime juice to give the drink a little citrus bite."
1.0,Chatfield's Chips ruined,"If you previously bought the Chatfield Carob Chips pictured in the tan bag, you know they were delicious.  The carob chips are now in a different packaging with ""NOW improved flavor"" written on the bag.  The remake of these carob chips was a BIG mistate... they are horrible.  They have no carob or chocolately taste - really no flavor at all except for a waxy surgary taste.  I gave them to my husband because his sense of taste is much blander than mine, but he told me to throw them away because they are not worth the calories.  If he won't eat something sugary, then I know it is bad.  Please don't waste your money on these.  I wanted to leave zero stars, but you had to check at least one."
5.0,the only peanut butter i'll ever eat,"So good...not too thick, not too peanut-y...the honey infusion makes this peanut butter perfect...i don't even eat jelly or jam when i make sandwiches with this. buy skippy's natural peanut butter with honey. it will change your life."
5.0,Perfect survivalist/preparedness item!,"I'm a big fan of Hormel's classic beef chili but let's face it, without a good fire to melt the 3/4"" of fat/flavor, it's a pretty lousy meal straight from the can!  It's one of the best there is for canned chili but it has its small flaws.  This turkey variety doesn't have the fat.  It's just as good straight from the can as it is in a bowl.  Stick a few cans of this in your pantry for emergencies and you'll always have a pretty decent, healthy meal when the power goes out.  For you hardcore survivalists and hikers/campers, strip the label off and just drop the bare unopened can into your pot as you boil your water.  Serves well over rice and well drained pasta, too!  For a pleasing change, try it over spaghetti or penne!"
1.0,Nasty tasting!,"I purchased these without having seaweed snacks before, but really liking wasabi, figured we'd give them a try.  I tried them, my husband tried them, and I even took them to work to see if I could find someone who would eat them.  No one found anything redeeming about them.  Just nasty.  Now, I have waited too long to return them, so I guess they will be thrown in the trash."
1.0,Darrell Lea Liquorice,I was quite disappointed. It was anything but soft as Darrell Lea claims it to be. I purchased 2 bags and both bags were absolutely horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone. (Strawberry flavored one)
5.0,Mauna Loa Macadamias,"I have been getting these on ""subscription"", at good price and just wanted to let others know that they are ""fresh"" , not stale as they are in some stores. and now they come right to my door. the ""subscription"" is good because with that you get free shipping . once a month, or if you want have 2  for twice a month. the stores in my area stopped carrying these so I tried this , and so far it has been a good experience."
1.0,Pretty Dry and Tasteless,I bought these as a quick snack and because they were on sale. My kids won't eat them because 'they're yucky.' I tried them and indeed they are!  They're dry and tasteless.
5.0,Experiment into the Lip Balm business.,"Sometime back it was suggested that perhaps Hemp would make a good lip balm.  Sounded good to me, so I started the research.  Hemp is loaded with Omega 3's and lots of good stuff.  It is the only thing I have found for Eczema that actually works.  So lip balm was a definite idea.  I could add it to the 4 Ewe with Lanolin, and Shea/Avacado butter that I already make and sell on eBay.  This stuff is wonderful!  This product is a little coarse for the lip balm, making it necessary to strain out the roughage.  But therein comes the best part. What to do with the roughage?  Light bulb.  The roughage goes into an almond oil/mando butter concoction that I also make and is used for a facial scrub.  This is not on the market yet, but it is coming soon. This facial scrub, though be it a little messy, coupled with my goat milk soap, leaves my face as soft as baby's bottom.  A friend suggested I name it ""Arse Lookin' at You"" which I am taking under advisement.  The lip balm was made and named Lip Bong as a little tongue in cheek experiment into the land of sarcasm.  I sell this stuff as fast as I make it and am working on finding a way to get it here into Amazon.  Seems Colorado and Amazon are involved in a ""no blink"" contest and it is the sellers who suffer.  I have since ordered two more jars of this stuff and I am cranking out the orders.  Keep it in mind if you have the rough skin going on cause it works and this stuff is natural and organic.  Just don't eat it. LOL  My Pillow Pets Pink Cuddly Bunny 18"" Head First  The Bentley Collection Guide, Sixth Edition "
1.0,Too much sugar - big time headache!,"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier."
1.0,deceptive labeling,"I just bought Bigelow Green Tea and would advise anyone purchasing this product to read the country of origin which is ""Product of China"".  The write up says that the product is blended and distributed in the USA, but that in itself is deceptive if the originating country is not listed.  Food products according to the Food and Drug administration aren't required to actually list where a product comes from."
1.0,bitter and very poor taste,I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.  First time ever my daughter said she didn't want her 'chocolate' pudding.
5.0,Delicious,"I drank this coffee over 30 years ago when I lived in The Netherlands. So glad that I can get it through Amazon. Strong, full bodied but easy on the tummy!!!"
1.0,"Good, but habit forming for my dog","My dog loves these chips.  Only thing they are high since he insists on having them a couple times a day.  Wonder what the secret ingredient is. HOWEVER, he would not eat this batch.  I called Dingo Co. to see if they had changed the formula, and they said no, and checked the bar code to find that these chips had been manufactured over two and a half years ago. THEY WERE STALE.  They are high enough to begin with but to have to pitch them out or pay to return them (paid for initial shipping) is wrong.  BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE."
1.0,Dog Will Not Touch This Stuff,"I bought this food back in February and the bag is still sitting in the pantry almost completely full. The dog simply will not eat it. I tried everything I could think of to get him to eat it: mixed in a little olive oil (which usually does the trick for him with other food; didn't work), mixed it with grated cheese (somehow the dog managed to eat just the cheese), mixed it with yogurt (he begs for anything that's dairy; no dice), mixed it turkey grease after browning ground turkey (he ate 2 bites, and that was it). I even ate a kibble of it myself just to see, and honestly it didn't taste that bad, kind of like very bland, grainy-vegetable granola. So, I figured that when he got hungry enough, he'd eat it. For 3 days he ate nothing, and finally on day 4, I broke down and bought other food."
5.0,Sugar Free Margarita Mix,This is by far my favorite margarita mix. I LOVE that it is sugar free and I LOVE that it taste so GOOD! I think you will enjoy this product as well. The only down side I have found it that I can't find it elsewhere so I have to buy it online.
5.0,MAster cleanse,"I've ordered this syrup 4 times now and I use it for the Master Cleanse.  Tastes great and can be used for ""regular"" syrup as well."
1.0,Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half,"Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.  Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.  UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.  The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well."
1.0,I don't know why my dog doesn't like these treats.,Both my dogs hate these things for some reason. Makes me angry that I bought these and they won't even touch them!  They smell good tho.
1.0,Cappuccino cups,B005K4Q1YA  This is just plain nasty tasting. Had to cancel subscription. The artificial sweetener is very overbearing and made the weak coffee taste like apple peelings.
1.0,Never again!,from all the harissa's i've tried this has to be the bitterest and worst tasting of them all. It is so bitter and too salty. Never again.
5.0,tasty sidedish,"I'm not a fan of rice.Then my husband has this as a side dish for our meal.Wonderful!!! Now we add it to dishes or just eat it plain!!! Healthy,too.What more could you ask for?"
1.0,Weak,You have to use two of these cocoa's.  One you have to open and put in the cup while using another in the machine.  This cocoa is very weak in taste and texture.
5.0,Exactly as promised! Great experience...,"This was exactly as promised, & was a great experience. Shipping got delayed by 2 weeks due to extreme wheather back east, however, that would be UPS's fault.  GOOD GOOD GOOD!!!"
5.0,Great product!,My dog loves these treats.  They really help to keep her teeth clean in between brushing. They also help her breath stay fresh and works well as a reward when she is good.
5.0,Better than bulk adzukis,"I've always liked adzuki beans, but whenever I've bought them in bulk at various stores, they tend to be poor quality, with many rocks that have to be sorted out, as well as a few shriveled up beans here and there.  I'm glad I tried these adzuki beans by Arrowhead Mills, because they're much better quality, but still at a reasonable price.  Every package in the case was fresh, and although there were a couple of pebbles in one bag (which is why you should ALWAYS sort dried beans before booking them, no matter what brand they are or where you got them), they were excellent over all."
5.0,Tamashiki please,"Tamashiki, the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of rice.  I get to eat this rice whenever I visit my momma bear, because my mom, who is Japanese, refuses to use anything else at her home.  This rice, is a different kind of experience.  Even if you are no rice connoisseur, you WILL taste the difference between this and regular brands of rice.  It's premium, but I think everyone who hasn't had quality rice should definitely give it a try."
5.0,English Tea,My son went to England and brought back this tea.  I fell in love with it and could not find it here in Florida.  Amazon!!! and the price was great and I just love my PG Tips Tea.
5.0,Love these noodles!,"These noodles are the best.  Zero calories. Zero carbs. Zero gluten.  They smell funny but other than that, they're great."
5.0,Packed With Nutrients. High Protein and Fiber. Low Sodium.,"Gosh! What next? A 24-ounce bag of raw, shelled hemp seeds. Well, I've consumed a certain amount of hemp in my youth, but we threw the seeds away. Pity. They're rather good when prepared right, and these are well prepared. They're called Hemp Hearts and I  stumbled upon them at Costco. Rather interesting. These little gems are really packed with nutrients and the protein and fiber are way up there. Plus, would you believe, there's no sodium. Yeah, and they taste rather good too. I just like to eat them by the spoonful right out of the bag. Plus, I'll eventually I get around to sprinkling them on things also. Who'd have ever thunk? I wonder if you can smoke them?  Gary Peterson"
5.0,As good as McDonalds,I prefer McDonalds coffee over Starbucks Alteria etc.  This is the closest I've found for home brewed coffee that matches the flavor of McD's.
5.0,Iced Tea for Iced Tea Connoisseurs,"A friend sent me two boxes of this tea two years ago for my birthday (and that now qualifies him as a really good friend), and since then I can't bring myself to make anything else. I make a large bottle of sun tea once a week with the exception of winter. This tea completely spoiled me for any other iced tea. Living in Texas, liquid refreshment is a necessity in the summer. The problem is finding a drink that's satisfying and not sugar-laden. The choices are limited to diet drinks (which I don't drink), water (which is nice, but you yearn for something with taste), and iced tea (the Texas kind, unsweetened). And because of the heat, we drink a lot of tea in my house. I've tried all kinds of teas including those ""specially blended for iced tea"" and froo-froo specialty teas they don't hold a candle to Tazo iced tea. Why? It has a distinctive rich and full tea taste...and I'm sorry but sweet tea covers true tea flavor. It's a shame that this is the only way you can buy it, but it beats not being able to buy it at all. Have an iced tea fanatic at your house? This will be their new ""crack tea""....I know it's mine."
5.0,Delicious,Everything I have ever tasted at a Caribou is a step above the competition. The bagged coffee is the same. The Caribou Blend is a balanced and satisfying coffee.
1.0,This was awful,"This tea was so disappointing!  It smells OK, but the taste is just strange.  I'm really glad I only got one box.  Don't waste your time or money."
5.0,Great Price,"I love these oats.  They are hearty and have a bite.  I do not like the quick oats for hot cereal, just for cooking.  I saved almost $1 by purchasing these oats from Amazon."
1.0,My Cats Will Not Touch Halo,"My two cats are older (16 & 13), yet they will try something new for a while and return back to their favorite.  They did not touch Halo.  I tried it out by putting the Halo alone in a bowl for them and noticed that they would not eat it. Then I provided them with their favorite Purina One Maturity and they proceeded to eat. Two days later, I placed the Halo and Purina One in separate bowls, they only ate the Purina One Maturity.  The product sounds wonderful but cats are finicky creatures.  I returned this item which is much more expensive than other brands."
1.0,"Sweet, cheap way to POISON yourself","Why would anyone put anything in there mouth, no matter how ""good"" it tasted, that had chlorine in it? Would you drink your swimming pool water?? People must be crazy!"
5.0,coconut oil is the best!,"if you ever use vegetable oil, butter, or shortening, then try coconut oil instead. it's very delicious, healthy, and vegan.  and this one by Nutiva is organic and affordable!  when used as an ingredient, it imparts a very slight coconut flavor and a filling feeling. like butter and other animal fats, it's a soft solid at room temperature, but it melts when slightly heated. as a result, it can be readily used in everything from stir fries to toast.  coconut oil is composed almost entirely of saturated fats, but unlike most animal fats, it has no significant effect on cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the bloodstream. unlike many other thick vegetable fats, it's not hydrogenated, so it doesn't degrade your cell walls. it contains high quantities of fatty acids that have potent anti-microbial, anti-fungal, and anti-viral properties. some research suggests that coconut oil could be effective in preventing infection by HIV, measles, and herpes. other research suggests that it increases the rate at which calories are burned, decreases the rate at which fat deposits are built up, increases insulin sensitivity, and decreases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.  and did i mention it's delicious?"
5.0,Great Coffee Creamer,"I really like this liquid creamer. I have had no problems with them spilling open in the carton. They are packed loosely in the box, but then placed into another box for shipping. These single count creamers makes it better for me because I don't have to worry about refrigeration only to keep the box in a cool area. I like the fact that this creamer has milk and cream in the ingredients rather than non dairy products as some of the other creamers have. This is my favorite flavor, but ID makes many very good flavors."
5.0,the greatest tea,"It is difficult to find this brand in the stores, so it is great to be able to buy all of the different varieties on Amazon. Dependable vendor"
1.0,Worst Food Product I've Ever Purchased,"How badly can someone mess up teriyaki flavoring? This noodle bowl is the least edible thing I've ever tasted. I'd compare the taste to Vegemite/Marmite and those Halloween blood capsules, and the smell to a burnt capacitor. After one bite I went outside to throw it out, I didn't want it stinking up my indoor garbage can. I have never been compelled to call a 'satisfaction guaranteed' hotline, but if Annie Chun's had one I'd be on the phone right now. After this disaster I nuked a Annie Chun's Spicy Szechuan which was a huge improvement, actually edible."
5.0,Excellent Cup Of Tea,"One of life's important luxuries is a good cup of tea , PG Tips gives this everytime and buying via Amazon when you are out of  the UK is the best way to get a reasonable price  for the product."
1.0,It Doesn't Appear to Be Organic...,"This popcorn is non-GMO, which means it isn't genetically modified. Nowhere on the bag does it claim to be organic.  While all organic corn needs to be non-GMO, not all non-GMO corn is organic.  Corn is genetically modified to make it resistant to pests and disease.  Non-GMO corn not grown organically is frequently sprayed with pesticides.  So Great Northern Popcorn needs to make it clear whether or not it is claiming this is an organic product, because the bag doesn't back up what is stated in the Amazon description.  If you search ""organic"" on the Great Northern Popcorn website, ""no results"" comes back.  Great Northern...is this corn truly organic, or simply non-GMO?"
1.0,Don't buy if you want cinnamon taste!!,This candy has hardly any cinnamon taste at all.  If you look closely at the product discription it states cinnamon twist with cherry flavor. Very misleading.  I would not buy again.
1.0,Terrible,"This product arrived in such poor condition that it was inedible.  The candy was dried out, tasteless, and completely worthless.  I was very disappointed."
5.0,Great product!,"I ordered this coffee for my husband, who is a huge coffee fan.  He really likes the bold flavors.  The product shipped fast, was fresh and the packaging was nice.  We will certainly buy this product again."
1.0,Unpleasant flavor and texture - Cucumber Dill,"I grabbed these because they were on a stand close to the cash register, they were gluten free, and I was hungry. I adore lentils and I love cucumber and dill. They sounded perfect.  In my hurry I forgot to check the ingredients. As soon as I opened the bag I realized my mistake. An overpowering odor of sour cream, a flavor I find repugnant, greeted my nose. I tried one just to be fair, but all I could taste was sour cream with a hint of dill. The texture was unpleasant too--foamy--kind of like one of those biodegradable foam peanuts had been flattened out and crisped up.  The offending ingredient, as far as I can tell, is buttermilk. I understand why chip makers put this buttermilky/sour creamy flavor in their ranch and sour cream & onion chips. I don't understand why it's in so many others, nacho cheese, cheddar cheese, cucumber dill. About the only safe flavor anymore is salt & vinegar.  I wish I could get my money back because there is no way I'm going to eat these and I'm pretty sure my family won't like them either. Too bad I didn't happen upon the sea salt flavor that everyone seems to like, because these were pretty terrible."
5.0,THE BEST!,"I first bought these on the way home from a trip at a remote farm stand...fell in love with them and have been looking for them everywhere with no luck...i was telling my cousin who lives about 6 hours from me if he ever heard about them or tried them, thinking maybe they had them out there..but he didnt...so one night he decided to check out some sites to see if they carried and bingo!,,,right here at Amazon.com...i am so delighted and am enjoying one right now while posting..im going to put myself on a timed automatic delivery, im in love, and so is my cousin now...lol"
5.0,I am hooked on this coffee,There may be a need to start a 12-step program for this coffee.  :)  I do not usually like flavored coffees but I am so glad that I tried this one.
1.0,One of the Worst GF products I have found to date,"Decided to try these the other day and regretted it. These are hard to bite, very stiff and dry, and did not taste like peanut butter and chocolate, tasted synthetic somehow. One of the worst GF products I have found to date. GF does not have to taste horrible and shouldn't! Will stick to Envirokids rice bars from now on they are much better."
5.0,NERRRRRRRRDS......,I just love Nerd ropes and so do my nephews-the price was right and it is the perfect addition to a cash Christmas present. They will be more excited about an entire box of nerd ropes than the cash I think!
1.0,Do not flame me.  This is so very yucky!  I am not kidding.,"Can you stand a differing opinion?  Please read this.  Recently, I bought the box of 24 of this product.  I thought it might be good food to have in case of emergency.  However, this is the first time I've bought something on Amazon that had universal praise, but I disagree with it.  I am wondering what kind of Italian food these people are used to?  Do they actually know how Italian sauce is supposed to taste?  Because this is not tasty!  Actually, I found it rather yucky, and three other members of my family confirmed the same result.  I followed the directions & made this exactly as was stated on the box.  The sauce you end up with has an undefinable, very strong taste to it.  Looking at the ingredients on the side of the box, it just lists ""spices"" so I don't know what that bad taste is really coming from.  Also, the Kraft brand spaghetti is not very good quality.  The only good thing about it is that you don't have to snap it to make it fit in the pot.  Other than that, the spaghetti is tasteless, fat, limp and bland.  Thank goodness there is not very much of that spaghetti (it only serves 4 from the box).  On top of not liking this product, I found that the actual components are overpriced.  You should just buy some excellent pasta, such as Barilla spaghetti that doesn't cost very much and makes alot more servings.  Add to that any jar of pre-made sauce.  In a side by side taste test, I bet the Barilla+jarred sauce would taste way better.  For now, I'm going to use up the awful Kraft noodles as well as I can, and chuck the ""flavor"" packets into the garbage."
1.0,cocktail mistro,Product was dark when opened and very watered down. Complained to the company but no response. Do not buy this product there is better product out there
5.0,One Swell Soup - thanks to Amazon!,"Campbell's Cream of Shrimp Soup has been a staple in my pantry for decades.  It was an easy starting point for all kinds of lovely seafood soups and sauces for nights when I was desperate for something fast and delicious.  Over the past few months, one supermarked chain after another in my area stopped carrying it. Totally unavailable, even by special order.  I was getting desperate.  So I tried Amazon.  Not only was it immediately available, the price including shipping was less than I had paid at the market.  Thank you Amazon - there will be shrimp and crab chowder for dinner tonight."
5.0,The best dark chocolate available,"This and the Costa Rica-origin dark, also from Cachet, are tied as the two best dark chocolates I've ever tasted. The Costa Rica is a purer dark-chocolate flavor; this has a little world of flavors, a bit of fruit and a bit of bite. Outstanding!"
1.0,Horrible!,"We got this because my dog had horrible breath! Well we gave him some last night and this morning he had 4 sezuires! I would never recommend this to anyone. We took him to a vet and it cost us over 300. Never again! Please, for the safety of your animals, do not buy this product."
1.0,Can I give less than 1 star?,"This stuff was disgusting.  Tasted NOTHING like mudslides I have had before.  Maybe I should check the ingredients again, perhaps it actually contains mud.  Avoid this product at all costs!"
5.0,Just add milk!,"I have always liked granola so when I was offered Love Crunch through the Amazon vine program I figured id give it a try.. This is by far the best granola I have ever had, it has nice big pieces of dark chocolate and they are delicious. I like that its organic, has low sodium, 0g of transfat, and its an excellent source of ALA omega 3.. For a 1/4 of a cup serving its 140 calories, 6 grams of fat, 6 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of protein. I like to add the granola to my cereal or by itself with milk and it is so good.. I got my granola at the end of march and the exp date is august 2012  and you get 6 bags of granola so its somthing to keep in mind. I also like the fact that for every bag of Love Crunch that is purchased this company will donate an equal amount to foodbanks in food or cash up to $1 million. I highly recommend this granola especially if you love dark chocolate like I do."
1.0,Slimey and disgusting!,"My initial taste of these roasted chestnuts were positive! However, after a week, the remaining chestnusts in the ziplock bag turned slimey and is covered with an unappetizing goo. I had to throw away the rest of the bag for fear of spoilage. DO NOT BUY!"
1.0,Yuck,"I ordered this because the Starbucks Whole Bean Columbian was not available for Prime shipping. What a mistake. There is an astringent undertone to this coffee, and it lacks the richness and flavor of the Starbucks product. I'm not sure what I am going to do with it, but I won't be drinking it."
1.0,Wasting my money never tasted so bad.,"I bought this from a local health food store.  I am a runner taking some down time and therefore trying to cut calories.  Thought that perhaps, even if it were not very flavorful, this could be made to work.  Even if it were just pleasant tasting overall, you can add a teeny bit of honey or splenda or something to make it work, and as a seasoned dieter/calorie cutter, there's not much I can't make work. The stuff has a gel-consistency, like several other Walden Farms products I have tried.  I put a small spoon of it in my mouth to try it out and INSTANTLY threw it in the garbage.  A $3 product.  It tastes nothing like peanut butter, or peanuts, or some imitation of either.  It's hard to describe what it tasted like.  Maybe if someone took Vaseline and put something really bitter in it along with some chemicals so there would be a long lasting aftertaste.  It was slightly salty, but mostly it made me feel like I was attempting to eat something not made for human consumption.  If you are able to put this in your mouth and not spit it out, you don't have tastebuds. If you're desperate for PB as a dieter, try one of 3 things: 1. PB2 is apparently popular. 2. I used to enjoy Better N' Butter, but I'm not sure if they make it anymore.  It IS available on Amazon.  Not the same, slightly syrupy sweet, but OK. 3. Take a lowfat PB and cut it with something lower calorie such as sugar free jelly or sugar free pancake syrup. Just whatever you do, don't try this mess."
1.0,"If you like poop juice, you're gonna love this energy drink","I've never actually tasted diarrhea, but this is what I'd imagine it tastes like.  I wanted to throw the full can through the window of the gas station that sold it to me, but I was already too far away and would have had to make an illegal u-turn."
5.0,puppy love,Price was much cheaper than ordering from big box pet stores and received the treats timely. Plan to be a returning customer.
5.0,GREAT!,Do not be mislead in thinking these are just tiny bits and pieces! There were nice large pieces as well in the can. Opened a can and made omlets for breakfast. They have good flavor and with the current special going on I feel I got a bargain at under a dollar a can!
5.0,This stuff is the best,"We use this for yeast bread, quick breads (like zucchini bread), pizza crust, and pie crust. It is hands down the best gluten-free mix we've found. You can substitute it for wheat flour in most recipes without doing anything fancy, although it helps to add a little extra egg (when the recipe calls for 3 eggs, I add 4).  One thing to note is that the dough doesn't rise that much till you put it in the oven, so don't panic about that."
5.0,Zico Rules on the Soccer field,"I didn't think they could improve on the original which has sustained me on the most hot and humid days in the mid-atlantic after a grueling soccer game. It works better that any Gatorade-type product I've ever tried. When I was in LA last month, I tried the new original flavor in the bottle and couldn't get enough of it. The only drawback is that it's in only a few stores on the Maryland area. Everyone has the Vita Coco which is always in stock--wonder why?"
1.0,Zico deserves ZERO STARs,"I don't know where to start. I feel like cheated. This product is described as ""Pure Premium Coconut Water"" but it tastes more like little bit of coconut oil mixed with water and served in a cheap plastic container. This product does not at all taste like coconut water. When you take a sip the first thing it reminds you of is ""Plastic"".  I have tried many brands of coconut water and this by far is the WORST. I have grown up drinking coconut water fresh from the shell. So I know the real taste. See my  review for ""Vita Coco"".  I had seen all the recent negative reviews. But they all suggested that there was a problem with one particular batch. I also noticed that Amazon had stopped selling this to investigate the problems reported in recent bad reviews. So when this product again came up for sell I trusted that Amazon has addressed the issue. I was always attracted to the packaging and wanted to try this for some time. Plus there was 15% off coupon. So I went ahead and ordered a case. Big Mistake!!  Amazon does not accept returns for this product. So only thing I can do is ""vent it out"" through this review. This is my first negative review and I believe Zico absolutely deserve NO STARS. I am giving one star because Amazon does not allow zero stars.  BTW, the case I received has expiry date of Dec 2011. I want to see reviews from other shoppers who have bought this along with me."
1.0,I'd rather eat the box!,"I was very disappointed in these brownies.  The taste and texture is awful.  Spongy texture, artificial taste, and unpleasant aftertaste.  I tried one and after two bites tossed it and the rest of the box away."
5.0,Medium Coffee,The brand of coffee is a nice medium brew.  I don't like coffee that is too bold or strong and this fits the bill.
1.0,Dry granola !!!!,Granola was very dry and not too sweet.  Need milk.  I prefer Costco's granola -- it taste much better.  I would not recommend the purchase of this product.  Now I got to find way to get rid of the other 5 packages.  Also bought the fruit and nut one.  Hope that's better.
5.0,Good Sugar at lower prices,"Though this sugar has lumps, most good sugars do! I am used to buying this at a local grocery chain, but once I found it on Amazon, and I found the price was cheaper than in the retail store, the decision was easy!"
5.0,Crunchy almond treat with a sassy Jalapeno kick!,"Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.  The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!"
5.0,Only Brand I now Recommend,"I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  ""Lamb meal"" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat."
5.0,Excellent dried cranberries for snacks and more,"We agree with the other reviews of this product.  These dried cranberries are excellent.  We eat them as snacks and add them to other foods as well.  They're not as sweet as Craisins, but we actually like them better.  We'll buy more and probably other dried fruit from the same vendor."
5.0,nummy good,"We have used Crystal Lite for some time - so went to the local Albertson's because they are the cheapest and they no longer stock it.  So did a search and found out it was available online thru Amazon.  Received the shipment.  On time, great product."
5.0,The Best!,"Rid is the tangiest , the spiciest, the best tasting bloody Mary mix EVER. I only wish they made bigger bottles."
5.0,Great product at a great price,"When Amazon has a deal and coupon on the cereal sets, they are well worth it.  This is one of our favorites and the price was even better than the Buy 1, Get 1 free deal that the grocery store runs."
1.0,Awful in Every Way...,"Most of the bags were broken and unusable... however, I eventually found a good bag and brewed some of this tea, and it was dreadful. It has tons of floating powder in it, and really sticks in your throat. The flavor is bitter and acrid, and nothing like what I have ever had in any Chinese restaurant. It's truly awful."
1.0,Terrible!!!,"This product had no real flavor! I had several people try it and nobody liked it. I ended up heating up a cup of milk and adding the powder from the K-Cup to it. It was the only way it was drinkable! Save your money, don't buy this!"
1.0,not good at all,"These cookies we not good at all. The hard chocolate chip ones were completely inetible, and the chocolate brownie bites weren't much better."
1.0,Wrong product sent,They have the picture of the sour berry so I bought a pack of 8 because they are my favorite and then they sent me the strawberry ones.  I will never purchase these again through amazon.com because what I order and what they sent me were completely different.  So I wasted $23.00 on the sours I don't like!!
5.0,A really good product,"OK, where do I start? Clif Bar is a company located in Berkeley, California, that specializes in foods for people on the go, focusing on environmentally sustainable practices. The ZBaR is made with all-organic non-genetically engineered ingredients with no trans fat, no high-fructose corn syrup. Even the packaging is made with non-toxic inks on foil (not plastic) wrapping, and packed in a recycled cardboard box.  So, this is really a good product. It tastes great, chewy and sweet with the firm chocolate chips providing a delicious counterpoint to the whole grain bar. My kids love it, and I feel good about it and the sustainable philosophy of the company. Like I said, a good product - good to eat, good for you, good for the planet.  (Review of CLIF Kid ZBaR, 1.27-Ounce Bars)"
5.0,Great find!,I was looking for a low calorie cocoa and found this - Amazon has everything doesn't it?  It is wonderful and you don't have to use as much cocoa as it says.  I also make a power smoothie and put some of this in it.  Yum!!
1.0,Not a challenge...,"I wanted a new challenge for my terrier, and she figured this out in no time flat.  Then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits.  So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else."
5.0,Delicious...,"Upon seeing convention-goers playing games with it, I decided to try it out and see what the big deal was all about. I was not disappointed. The flavors were a bit unique upon first tasting it, but they quickly grew on me and I ended up eating nearly half the box by the end of the day. They have just the right amount of sweetness and a very smooth texture that's fun to play with. I look forward to buying it again."
1.0,Horrible tasting product,I am a die hard Fruit Roll-up fan. So I decided to give these a try since they are all natural. I did NOT like the flavor or texture of this product. It was dry and does not have much flavor. Do not recommend. I am going back to Fruit Roll-ups permanently. I have posted this same review for Strawberry as I purchased both products.
1.0,Salt lick,"I was excited to get some ""jerky like you get at trade shows"" this was the worst jerky my family has ever had,inedible,salt lick. Jerky normally is gone in minutes this was gone all right out to the  garbage ,I was very disappointed"
1.0,come on...,got this. it was a pound and a quarter short.. i was really sad. the price i found out was really high. we got same thing at the dollar store for 1/3 the price i paid here... i am so silly for not looking around fist.
5.0,caramel apple,"I have to use sugar free items as a result of gastric bypass surgery.  Sugar makes me very sick.  Also, as a result of my surgery I need to intake a lot of protein daily.  I use the sugar free caramel syrup to make one of my protein shakes along with no sugar added frozen applesauce.  It tastes delicious."
1.0,POOR customer service,"I purchased this product from Babys R us and was using it for a few months until all of a sudden the steam start button or the blend button wouldn't always consistently worked.  Tried to return to Babys R us with my repceipt.  They wouldn't take it back and said to contact Baby Brezza.  I left an email with customer service in early November and actually got a call back in a day.  She said she would ship out a replacement and I had to ship back the lid.  I still haven't received the replacement as of today (1-10-12).  I left another email last week and haven't heard from anyone.  I will try calling the 888 number tomorrow.  But it doesn't look promising.  If only they'd give me a refund, I can buy the Baeba."
1.0,BAD! JUST PLAIN BAD!!!,"We might not be a gourmet club, but we know when something looks and tastes like wall paper paste. (And please don't get us started on the strange smell!)  I have used Hamburger Helper for years (admittedly not that often) but had never before used the Stroganoff variety. Well... we will never, ever use it again. What a waste of perfectly good beef. And, FYI, I thoroughly followed the directions, and used fresh, lean hamburger purchased only an hour before. (Honest!)  Gross."
5.0,My dogs love them,My dogs (and some other dogs I like to spoil too) just love these.  They are their special treats.
5.0,La Morena Whole Jalapenos,"A spicy pepper with onions and carrots prevalent, in the can, having a wonderful flavor and a potent kick to boot. Great with all foods and nice, if you can handle it, by itself."
1.0,Disappointed,This Tiny box of mediocre chocolates cost 20$... Not including shipping.  Not worth it.  Just go with Sees or Godiva.... I wish I could return it
1.0,a way overpriced item that is cheaper elsewhere.........,Do not buy this from amazon. get it at sam's club for around $6.00 for the case shown. Buy from sam's club before choosing amazon.
1.0,Worst Risotto of All Time,"If you like Lipton chicken noodle soup, or a close facsimile, enjoy this hot garbage that the fine people of Alessi Imported dish out and claim is ""Italian"". This would be true if ""Italian"" meant salty bile. Thanks for wasting my time and money."
5.0,Love this tea!,"Began drinking this tea while living in France, gorgeous smell with a bit of a sweet taste, very relaxing (and I don't usually drink tea)! It really is exceptional. I haven't been able to find it in the US, so excited it is sold on amazon.com."
1.0,Might cure a cough,"We love Malibu Rum but they sure missed the mark with their Rum Punch. I even tried to mix it with some juice and fruit but the cough syrup flavor was still present. Don't waste your money. Too bad there's not a no star option, one star is still too high."
5.0,Change from Sugar to Splenda,"I never noticed the difference in my hot or cold drinks that I use to use sugar and I changed to splenda, they claimit's better for you,so I took the chanage and glad I did. It's great."
1.0,Nasty Taste,"I do not like this product at all.  It is expensive and especially if you give it away.  It has a very nasty taste that I cannot describe.  The more you use the worse it gets.  I am going back to other things.  Perhaps AGAVE or I may go back to Nevella, which I think is as good as Splenda and Equal.  Only I dont know what Nevella is made from.  At least I can bare the taste."
1.0,Disappointed.,The lid to this tea box detached after about 2 weeks of use.  The screws to keep the lid on are too short and stripped the pressed board the product is made out of.  So basically after opening and closing the box 1-2x per day it is ruined and there is no way to fix it.  I do NOT recommend this product.  Very disappointed.  Don't waste your money.
5.0,Excellent flavor and value,"This is excellent Herbe de Provence at a fraction of the cost of the grocery store.  We bought our first batch last January (9 months ago), bagged it in double Ziploc bags and just finished it off (ordering more!).  The last of the batch was still good.  We use it on grilled lamb, osso bucco, sometimes even grilled fish..."
5.0,BBQ Sauce with zing!,"We found out this is the BBQ sauce we've loved for years at our favorite roast beef sandwich place in South Boston, MA(Liberty Bell, if you're ever in the area) and my husband had to have it! We found it through Amazon, and it was a no brainer to buy it! Having it ourselves, won't stop us from going to our favorite haunt, we'll just have it to enjoy on other foods now, too! It's definitely on the spicy and zesty side and has a bit of a kick, so if you're looking for a sweet BBQ sauce, this one's not for you!"
1.0,Very disappointing,This tastes just like brown water. It is lacking flavor and leaves a bland feeling in my mouth after I drink it. Being organic doesn't really make a difference in taste. It tastes worst than the conventional hot chocolate. If I were you I would not buy it.
5.0,awesome,"I love this coffee, glad I bought the 24 pack! I do like bottled Starbuck's mochas but think this has a more natural flavor. There is a fine balance between the coffee and cocoa flavors. I just have to shake gently for 2-3 seconds. It does energize me, but luckily, does not turn me into a tasmanian devil. The can is a good enough size to linger on for 2-3 minutes. I love this stuff both right from the can or poured over ice. I took one to work and it was a great way to break. Pray Amazon never discontinues this because I am hooked. Can't wait to buy again!"
1.0,No effect for either me or my husband,"My husband is an energy drink addict on the weekends in his attempts to stay up all night. I thought maybe if these worked for him, he could cut down on his energy drink intake and therefore cut down on all the calories and sugar that comes with it. Unfortunately, these did absolutely nothing for him.  I tried them as well, thinking that it might just be him. I don't really drink anything with caffeine besides a coffee every few days sometimes and do not ever drink energy drinks or anything of the sort. I tried drinking one of these an hour before I would normally start getting tired at night for four nights in a row. And all four nights, I was asleep before my usual bedtime. These might work great for some people (as shown by how many good reviews these have) but they didn't have any effect on either me or my husband. Looks like my husband will be making due with his energy drinks for a while longer."
1.0,"I'm no coffee snob, and this coffee was undrinkable","Perhaps I got a bad batch, but this coffee was undrinkable. Undrinkable. And I am not a coffee connoisseur, opining on the finer points of the best brews. I literally mean that this was the worst coffee, hands down, I have ever tasted. It was as if I had run hot water through the used grounds of the coffee I'd been buying before this (I always buy organic/fair trade, and I like a medium-strong brew). My husband is also no coffee snob, and he knew right away that something was amiss. If I could return this I would.  I may just use the rest to fertilize my blueberry bushes."
5.0,So Cute!!,"I bought Drinking Duck couple months ago from Ebay. It's glad to see that people now can buy Drinking Duck on Amazon Now. Drinking Duck is very easy to use. I brought it with me when I went to friends' party and picnic in the park. Although it is made of plastic, it doesn't have obnoxious plastic smell. It is washable and reusable, better than non-reusable plastic cup or paper cup. GO GREEN!!"
1.0,Where is the currant flavor?  Tastes like Lipton,"This tastes pretty much like your plain old Liptons tea.  I LOVE cassis (black currant) flavor and was so looking forward to the tea. I buy a blackcurrant tea in Europe that actually tastes like cassis, so I know it is possible.  It is drinkable, but nothing special.  Look elsewhere if you want blackcurrant flavor."
1.0,Shoddy Packaging,"The product was shipped in a timely manner but the packing used to ship the product was inadequate. One of the bottle caps arrived broken and the contents spilled over the remaining products. This made for quite a mess and a lot of dissatisfaction. To add insult to injury, I submitted pictures and a complaint with no response to date or any type of replacement. I will not order again."
5.0,Super food for Women,Just recently started with this product...has alkaloids that promote balance to endocrine system...it has worked fantastically for my menopausal symptoms. Also gives energy...like time released and curbs the apetite...I will continue with this product indefinitely.
5.0,Fruity,"This is one of the best blueberry preserves ever.  Very fruity with berries.  Great on toast, matzos, crackers.  Excellent as a side topping for cheese cake."
5.0,Awesome flavor!,"I have used this Weber Roasted Garlic & Herb Seasoning NUMEROUS times, on hamburgers, chicken, porkchops, etc..  My latest use was on a huge pork butt that I fixed on my Rotisserie.  I just rubbed it all over, & cooked it for 3 hours, rotating on the Rotisserie.  It was the BEST pork we had ever eaten, (including in Texas,& at any restaurant!)  Super simple, & super delicious-great for company!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
1.0,Colored with insect soup! Carmine!,"GREAT just dandy Frickin' Cytomax uses carmine as a color additive. Here's how carmine is made:  To prepare carmine, the powdered scale INSECT BODIES are boiled in ammonia or a sodium carbonate solution, the insoluble matter is removed by filtering, and alum is added to the clear salt solution of carminic acid to precipitate the red aluminium salt, called ""carmine lake"" or ""crimson lake.""  Carmine is insect soup. Yummy!  For crying out loud Cytomax. take the danged bugs out of your mix!  And AMAZON posts what appears to be a list of ingredients that does not list carmine.  Cytomax, most of us are adults and aren't overly concerned with color of our drink. We are not children squawking about the color of our kool-aid being off and refusing to drink it.  If I had one complaint about Cytomax, besides the bug soup, it would be the color is ridiculous! Who needs such a fluorescent orange color to drink it! It goes is an opaque bottle anyway...who really looks at it.  Cytomax is another company that has over thought the entire deal and basically ruined an other wise great product.  Sending mine back.  W"
1.0,Don't buy this flavor,"I tried this flavor today and it tastes really bad. The potatoes were not cooked well. I have tried different brands (like Gits, Priya etc.) and this is the worst tasting flavor ever."
5.0,My daughter-in-law loves this baby food maker.,My daughter-in-law loves this baby food maker.  It met all her expectations.  She started using it right away and has been very satisfied.
5.0,BEST SUGAR COOKIES WE'VE EATEN!,"I bought these and another brand and although the others are good, these are much better. The flavor is terrific, the cookies must contain real butter to taste this good. We will be buying more."
5.0,My picky eater dogs LOVE these,"This is the only brand of treats that my dogs will not only eat, but actually beg for. I've given these as gifts to my dog owner friends always to rave reviews...I love that they're all natural and good for them."
1.0,May not be what you want for your dog,"These dog treats are very poor quality, many of the casing are empty, the are dried out and very ununiform in size.  May fit the saying ""wouldn't feed it to my dog."""
5.0,Tastes good and good for you,"I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years, and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste.  I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids.  Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.  As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option.  There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol.  There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g are from sugar.  There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 120 calories."
1.0,Hard Marzipan,I wouldn't reccomend this product due to the fact that the paper stuck to most of the marzipan. Does look pretty when it comes though.
5.0,Treat!,Purchased as hurricane supplies that arrived before Isaac.  Tasty and filling munching during the storm.  Great product.  Plan to buy more.
1.0,Product Never Arrived,Zero is not an option so I had to rate this 1 star. Inquiry emails were ignored. The order was never processed. Quite a disappointment!
5.0,Good Value,Items are just what we requested. They stopped selling these dog treats at Cosco and Sams. Glad they were available on-line
1.0,Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply,"This brand did not help me with my milk supply.  I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior.  The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand.  I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality."
1.0,Quantity not worth the money,"I could not belive the size of these tins for the price, so I ventured to measure the quantity since it didn't seem possible that the tins could possible hold 25.5 ounces in oil. Surely, the weight includes the weight of the tins which feels heavy enough to raise suspisions The quality was average and thus overpriced. Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice. I will continue to do what I have been doing in the past and shop around.  Update  This oil is dangerous for frying in a pan, it splashes as if water was added to make this oil which would explain the lightness in texture. Disapointed that the container does not disclose that this is not pure oil and that water is being added."
5.0,Easy to Use!,"I found these cups to be easy to use, and a lovely way to make pods of your own favorite coffee."
5.0,Chocolate Lovers Cake,This gluten free cake mix is the best. The wholegrain ingredients are an added bonus. My friends and family are amazed; when they find out this cake is gluten free. The recipe is easy to follow and bakes up perfect every time.
5.0,Twining English Breakfast Tea K-cup,"Like all K-cups for Keurig, they are quick and convienent. The taste is full and rich. I would recommend."
5.0,Wonderful!!,These are the best candy bars EVER!  Why don't they have something similar here in the U.S.??  They are light and low in calories compared to other candy bars in the U.S.!  Yumm!!
1.0,"How can this be called a ""gift"" pack?",I got this as a Christmas gift and am now embarassed to give it.  The description sounded great but it failed to mention that it would be sent in a plain cardboard box with all of the samples jumbled up.  I'll have to find a better container to give this in.  Very disappointed!
1.0,Aaaaaagggghhhh!  Awful!,"These stuffed mushrooms arrived with no cooking directions attached.  (I purchase frozen food online from another retailer---everything comes with cooking directions, times, etc...I am used to superior products.)  I perused the original site online for the proper cooking directions, then followed them to the letter.  First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage."
5.0,"We Love it, THE BEST YOU CAN BUY!!!","I have had my 22lb. Terrier mix on this since she was 1 yr old and she just turned 3 yrs old. She just had full blood work and liver/pancreatic enzyme readings as I have her on Atopica for allergies and they advise once yearly blood work. So far 3 tests total, one before Orijen, another after one yr on Orijen, and another after two yrs of being on Orijen. My vet said my dog has excellent blood/liver/pancreatic readings, in fact, he said better than most. In fact her readings where so good that he asked me what i was doing/feeding her and told me to keep doing what you have been cuz her blood work is so good and especialty as she is on Atopica and Comfortis. Orijen Fish is the only dry dog food I could find that didnt use chicken fat in it, which my dog is very allerigic to. My dog is also allergic to the follwing (confirmed by allergy testing, yes it was expensive)...chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, bison, pork, and most grains like rice, oats, wheat, corn, flax, etc...as well as fleas. I feel this food has saved my dogs life as I cant find another food she can tolerate and thrive on, yet she also loves the taste and is holding a perfect weight on only 1 cup a day so even though its pricey, only having to feed 1 cup a day makes it very ecomonical. I feel this is the best dog food I can buy for my dog."
5.0,Delicious!,Received as promised. This coffee is an unusual departure from the Keurig-oriented standards. A Flavor you can actually taste - the right combination of quality beans and proper roasting make this selection a winner in our house... I'll be looking for more of these...!
5.0,Most delicious tea EVER!!!--has a red hot taste that no other tea has!!!,"My daughter & I always have lunch & Ashby's tea at this little English-type cafe in Bolivar, MO, when I visit.  My fav. Ashby's tea is the Christmas spice--it takes like red hots.  My daughter likes the Plum one.  All of them R delicious!!!  This is the loose tea & is a lot less than the individually packed tea bags.  Yum!  Car' 4 a cu' o' tea?  Oh, yes, lovely!  ;)"
1.0,imposter product,"My cats have been eating this for several years and up to now-have loved it.  I have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon.  This last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims.  When the can is opened, it initially looks and smells like salmon, but underneath the 1/8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff, is something else.  It looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product, because it is not the same underneath, nor does it look or smell the same.  My cat vomited with the first feeding.  My cats don't like it now.  they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest.  I want to know where amazon got this batch of cans, because it is not Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance. Someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud. Identifiers on the bottom of the can are: NBSCP, best by Jan 13 15, the numbers below the sku on the box are: 723633004152."
1.0,Bitter and hotter than stated,"This product is not mild!  Also, it is bitter to the taste.  If you're looking for something mild, this isn't it.  It's a waste of money -- if you want something with great taste and a milder form, try Tobasco's brand of 'Green Pepper Sauce' (in green bottle).  It doesn't have the bitterness of this product and it is readily available in supermarkets.  The shipping cost on this product is tantamount to highway robbery!"
1.0,"Too little for the price, and poor quality","I was extremely disappointed when these came.  As others mentioned, the price was outrageous, but my husband likes the cherries and we didn't have blueberries locally.  When they arrived, for $1 each, they were dry and lacked flavor.  I have enjoyed many varieties of chocolate fruits, some better than others, but I can honestly say these were THE WORST!  Don't waste your money."
1.0,Worst solid alacore tuna ever,"This is bad tuna, can't say it any better. It's flavor and smell tend to be very strong, not what you expect from the top of the line tuna they make. The chunk light they make is slightly better. 1 in 4 cans actually are solid albacore, the other 3 are made up of mush, I can't even call it chunk style. I don't eat tuna in salads or sandwiches, I eat it out of the can. When I buy solid albacore, I expect that, this brand can't be trusted to give quality time after time. DON'T BUY."
1.0,the HFCS sucks,You will die from the High Fructose Corn Syrup. There's no need for this corporate sweetness when integrity and health matter in food.
5.0,Love this stuff!!!,"I buy this every winter as a little treat to myself.  I like it with just hot water, but I recently started adding it to my coffee instead of creamer.  I love it!"
1.0,DO NOT ORDER,"I AM SURE THESE BARS ARE VERY GOOD, BUT PROBABLY DURING SHIPPING THEY BECAME TOO WARM! I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY A SINGLE BAR. THEY CAME STUCK TO THE PAPER WRAPPING ALL THE WAY AROUND AND I CAN'T OPEN TO ENJOY THE BAR. I HAVE THROWN THE CONTENTS AWAY. I WOULD APPRECIATE A REFUND TO MY AMAZON ACCOUNT. DON MARTIN"
1.0,"No Product, No Email answer to the one I sent.",If you value your money stay away from this company. They like to take your Money but don't give in return so you have to get it back else where and still don't get your product.
1.0,Extremely unhappy.,"I have used this dog food for years, and I have never had any problems with it in the past.  Prairie must have put out a bad batch of it to the point where it should have been recalled (I found many bad reviews after the fact).  It smelled terrible upon opening the bag, and my dog turned her nose away from it.  I won't begin to tell you what she is normally willing to eat.  I've had to switch brands, and I doubt I will be returning to Prairie in the future.  Amazon responded beautifully to my concerns, I just wish they had known about the bad batch up front so it wouldn't have been sent in the first place."
1.0,SUCKS-SUCKS-SUCKS,I HAD THIS BAG FOR ONE WEEK AND IT SUCKS! CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE STILL BUY THESE STUPID BAGS!  CORNER RIPPED WHILE MAKING GRAPE JUICE! BULL-S*** !  YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF GETTING A LARGER BAG BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY LOW QUALITY AND ONE HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!
1.0,Skinny Cappuccino - Yuck,I love coffee....especially cappuccino--and I love my Nescafe coffee maker...but this flavor...is not good.  Only way to make it bearable is to dump tons of sugar in it...no longer making it skinny...coffee just is not tasty....
1.0,Didn't work for me,I could smell whatever they put on it and that made it promising to me that it was going to work.  However I experienced the same exact thing as the other posts on here...Dog went to look at it and kept on going.  I took him to it and did what the package said but it didn't work.
5.0,Head Rush Frozen Hot Chocolate,"If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm, that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue.  Ingredients: Sugar, non-fat dry milk, dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali. The blend of cocoa powders is especially rich and smooth.  This is a super fast dessert to make because all you do is put milk (even nonfat milk works) in a blender, add the packet of cocoa and then blend with a few cups of ice.  Within seconds of sharing this with my husband, we both knew we had been drinking this beverage too fast. Brain freeze! You can drink this much faster than a milkshake. You have been warned. It is tempting and delicious, but may need to be sipped more slowly...or not.  Optional toppings include whipped cream and of course chocolate shavings. Sipping this while wearing Opium perfume is a fun experience. It seems to enhance the experience and add new levels to the chocolate perfection. Oh I think I feel a sugar rush coming on...  My favorite way to drink this:  1. Turn on heating blanket when the weather turns cold.  2. Climb into bed wearing something silky.  3. Sip away while reading poetry.  So delicious!  ~The Rebecca Review"
5.0,the only seeds i like,"I have a hard time finding these in the store so I typically have to buy them from amazon when they're in stock.  These are the only flavored seeds I like, all the others are disgusting to me.  If I can't find these, which seems to be more and more common, I unhappily buy unflavored."
1.0,Not good at all,"I have a yorkie (4 lbs) so I got the extra small one. Not a single doggie-bite-size treat could come out from where it supposed to, and that was me trying to get the treats out... So, don't bother with this toy, your dog is only gonna drool all over from smelling that toy."
1.0,NOT GOOD,This particular box of Pop Tarts was stale and nasty.  I used by the expiration date...so this shouldn't have been an issue. I won't buy this product again.
1.0,Cafix - Nofix,"Nice package but you cant drink the package. The product has no flavor no taste no smell nothing not even a scent or detection of coffee aroma what-so-ever. When I make my coffee I make it weak, I dont need a lot of coffee flavor to get the taste, so it wouldnt take to much for me to taste it, but this product is void of any coffee smells or taste. I will never buy this again. I even tried adding some real coffee but not good."
1.0,A Lavazza coffee that fell short of expectations,I ordered this coffee to taste it. It leaves an unfinished taste that falls short of a satisfying cup of coffee.  I grind my beans using a burr grinder and use an automatic espresso machine and it still fails to hit the spot!  I hope Lavazza reevaluate this coffee.
1.0,Not For Me,"I have been drinking oolong teas for over 40 years, not because of any claimed health benefits, but because I enjoy the flavor - at least most of the time.  After seeing how highly this tea was rated I was really disappointed with how it turned out.  It has a fairly strong bitter taste, and the flavor isn't pleasant at all.  If you open one of the bags you will find the tea has a sawdust consistency, no recognizable leaves at all.  If you want a really good oolong at a reasonable price, I recomend the Numi ""Iron Goddess of Mercy"" loose tea."
5.0,my kittly loves these,"I've tried lots of treats and these temptations are the first to be a hit in every flavor.  I keep them in an airtight glass jar, and as soon as I shake it the noise makes her come running from whereever to get a treat.  I also use them as a reward whenever she scratches on the scratching post instead of the couch, she loves them so much she scratches all the time and then looks at me for a treat."
5.0,Chicken Filet Treats.,"A very good product.  Now, we share the chicken strips with both the dog and the cat every day.  Both come a beggin'."
1.0,butter soggy nuts,These outside does not have the crunch I was looking for and the nut is soggy. Complete waste of money. If it would have let me give no stars I would have.
5.0,Lifesaver,"I am required to eat 2 a day. Zero fat, fiber that removes cholestrol, low calorie. Cuts my apetite for weight control. At 70 cents a day Ms. Obama can have America fight obesity & heart disease & colon health & se%ual enhancement by making 2 oat servings a day as law."
1.0,Terrible...,"The instructions were completely wrong. If you actually follow the instructions, you'll be left with gruel to eat. If you like gruel, this probably won't be a problem."
5.0,Great condition,"This is the only seller I know that sells N. Alata which is the easiest nepenthes to take care of. And buying other nepenthes from other sites, I realized how this seller has sent me the nepenthes in great/best condition. Every single leaves were green and healthy along with big pitchers. I've bought nepenthes and some other plants from other sellers but some of the leaves were most of the times brown and the pitchers are always small. This seller on the other hand, sends me the plants in the best condition.  I'm definitely looking forward to buy this nepenthes again from this seller. I mean this is the only seller so far that has sent me nepenthes with big pitchers with good price."
1.0,Careful - This food made 2 dogs very sick!!,"My mom recommended Weruva dog food to me for my dog, because she gives it to her new puppy and the puppy loves it (my mom buys the food from a store). It's expensive food so instead of buying it in an all natural dog food store, I bought it online instead.  My dog has eaten a lot of different brands - PurinaOne, Beneful, ScienceDiet, and Ceasar (which he eats regularly) - and none of them have given him stomach issues.  As soon as I started giving him this food (adding it slowly to his diet), he began to lose his appetite and have mild diaherra. I continued him on the food for 2-3 weeks, thinking that his body just had to adjust to the new food, but when his symptoms didn't improve, I stopped feeding it to him. The day after I stopped giving him the food, he was fine! Back to his normal digestion.  I was convinced it was just my dog having a wierd reaction, so I gave the cans of food to my mom to give to her dog (no need to waste expensive dog food!). As soon as my mom gave the food to her puppy, the puppy got very very sick - bad diahhera and vomiting! They took the puppy off of the food i gave them and she is doing better now.  The cans of food were not expired, so we are not sure if it was this batch of f"
5.0,"OIL, not flavoring, of anise","Was very pleased to find this oil. It is not a flavoring, which is the most common form of anise. My wife used the oil to flavor a baked bread, which she calls fettines. The fettines have the strong taste and aroma of anise, which is perfect with strong, black coffee."
1.0,Terrible,"Ugh, worst coffee ever.  I've been trying to find some good instant coffee that's cheap, but after this one I just gave up and gave in to buying the expensive Starbucks like everyone else.  If anyone has any other suggestions for cheap good tasting instant coffe, please comment below. There was nothing actually wrong with the shipment or product itself except for the terrible taste.  Definitely not my taster's choice though."
1.0,"Disappointed by omissions, replacements, and quality","I ordered this gift package on extreme sale, and I still don't feel it was good value.  Many items were omitted or replaced -- I don't have it in front of me, but I don't believe I got the skeleton gummies, cotton candy, pretzels, or caramel corn.  No name-brand candies (""Tootsie rolls, Hershey bars, Skittles, M & M's and more!"") were included; this was replaced by a bag of Breyers chocolates (a dollar at any drugstore).  ""Pumpkin shortbread"" and ""pumpkin chocolate"" cookies were pumpkin-shaped, but not pumpkin-flavored.  The coloring set and pumpkin-carving sets were dollar-store quality.  The box was packed securely in Amazon's shipping box, but the bottom of the cute box was broken out and wouldn't pop back, so the contents slip out.  Unfortunate, since it's a nice design.  I'm very glad it was shipped to me and not directly to the gift recipient.  I would have been embarrassed and I would never have known how much wasn't included.  You could easily make a better version of this gift box for under $10 at a dollar store."
1.0,Unhappy,"I ordered the Original Blend of Dunkin Donuts and received a hazelnut flavored version.  In addition, I was charged 18.00 each for 12 oz packages.  The local market charges 9.00 each.  I don't want the hassel involved in returning this order, but I won't order food items from Amazon again, EVER!"
5.0,"Healthy, Tasty Addition to Diet",Blueberries are full of antioxidants. Adding them to your diet is an excellent healthy addition. Keeping fresh blueberries on hand isn't always an option for our on-the-go family. These dried blueberries have been an excellent way to get the nutritional benefits of blueberries. This particular item is delicious and of good quality. I love that it is sold in bulk and can be set up on the subscribe & save = super convenient!
1.0,NOT HAPPY,ORDERED SCORPIAN PEPPER SEEDS AND MAGIC SCORPIAN PLANT IN A CAN TOTTALY DISATISFIDE NOTHING GREW NOT EVEN ONE PLANT. JUNK JUNK I SHOULD GET MY MONEY BACK
5.0,"SPAM, the legendary canned meat.",We rarely eat meat.  I became hooked on SPAM in Hawaii and have never looked back.  This stuff is great.  Buying it here is cheaper than the store.
1.0,not what I expected,"I didnt like these, ended up throwing them away because I thought I was getting more of a chocolate fix out of them than a healthy snack. The berries were dry and crispy - I was expecting maybe a little chewy like a small raisin or something."
1.0,Moist and Juicy... NOT...,I like a variety of jerky but this Peppered style from Oh Boy! all I can say is Oh NO!!!!!! Thin sliced is OK but not when it is as dry as cardboard. I did not like this product at all. I don't usually do reviews but I felt I had to give my opinion on this one. I will NOT be buying this one again... Sorry Oh Boy! Oberto...
5.0,The smell of real coffee that's very good!,"I think I read every single review here before ordering. At the low, subscribe-and-save price with free shipping, it was a no brainer to give this coffee a try. They arrived quickly and were packed in sealed, thick plastic bags. When I opened one of the packs, I was in heaven over the fresh smell of coffee! I have missed that with the conventional plastic k-cups. I don't know why more coffee companies wouldn't want to use the filtrated type k-cup method over the plastic. It's more natural and I don't see an issue with losing the freshness of the coffee if stored in a zip lock bag or container. Some complained of sediment in the bottom of their cup. I have not had this issue. Nor do I have those few tiny grinds floating in my coffee anymore as I sometimes had from brewing from the plastic k-cups.  As for the taste of the coffee: I am a coffee snob. I admit it. I wouldn't be caught dead drinking convenience store coffee or Maxwell House type coffee! This is a smooth blend with no bitter aftertaste. It smells heavenly as it brews and is not weak. It tastes like a medium blend with slight hints of a dark roast. Some days I like it that way and other days, I run it through the Keurig twice for a lighter, yet still smooth taste. I end up with a large mug of coffee for (at this current time on subscribe & save pricing) less than twenty-five cents a cup!  I can't imagine ever wanting to have my coffee brewed through a plastic k-cup again or paying sixty cents a cup for other k-cups.  Enjoy this fabulous coffee and bravo to this coffee company for coming up with this far superior filter-style k-cup!"
5.0,"WOW, so cute",I got these for my grandsons 4th birthday party. It was in a pirate theme. These are PERFECT for the party gift bags to give to the kids. They are so cute you almost don't want to eat them (ALMOST)
5.0,BEST food for Weight Reduction,This food is great! My little dog was 3 lbs overweight-followed the instructions for feeding amounts and he lost it all within 2 months-he is more energetic and lively than ever and at a perfect weight. Great Product!!
5.0,Great Sampler of candy,It was a Christmas gift for a friend.  She loved it.  I had no idea that there was so much candy in the box for that price.
5.0,Love this cup!,"I have always loved the Tree of Life design and this cup reminds me of it. The cup itself is very practical. I use it both with tea bags and loose tea. The little metal filter does double duty in my kitchen as does the lid, fitting another non Tea-Forte cup. I appreciate that the lid keeps my tea warm longer. All in all it's a good value. Without a handle, it fits well in my cabinet. I purchased two others to keep as gifts."
5.0,Perfect portable creamer for me,I discovered this when I was going on a trip one time and someone found it for me at the store.  I use low fat refrigerated creamer usually.  I don't like to use half and half and definitely don't like the powdered stuff. This travels very well.  I can even carry some with me to use for creamer at dunkin donuts. It's true that the sell by date isn't more than a few months after I purchase it but that's fine for me.  I stopped getting the refrigerated creamer and use only the mini moos.  A box of 96 doesn't last a month for me.
1.0,Never arrived!,"This package never arrived, even though it's marked on my Amazon account as received.  I never received it, and can't seem to reach anyone to complain about it or get my money back.  Amazon doesn't even have a help section for this problem, they just tell you to contact the carrier, which I tried.  They told me to check with my neighbors and basically deal with it myself.  What a waste of money."
5.0,Super Snack,These beef jerky medallions are delicious. Have tried both teriyaki and peppered. (both great) Can't just eat one.  Great gift idea too!
1.0,Little to no flavor,"For a total of $12, making them the most expensive peanuts in the world, these didn't earn their keep.  The flavor is not baked onto it like Planters Dry Roasted peanuts but rather is a powder that is sprinkled onto them so does not stick.  What flavor there was rested in the bottom of the tin and after sampling that, it tasted like 10% cheese, 5% jalapeno, and 85% salt.  Very weak: I gave them away to a co-worker that had no tastebuds and low standards - who was happy to have them for free."
5.0,Colman's Mustard at a great price!,"Finally, Colman's mustard sold in the US for a reasonable price! With the subscription service, this is the best mustard in the world for only a little more than your standard grocery mustard. Without it, the six-pack is still reasonably priced- especially compared with ebay and other places where jars are sold for $6 each.  This mustard has a nice kick to it and will make anything you eat better."
1.0,Stale Taste + Brownish Color = DISAPOINTMENT,"It came vacume packed and I assumed after reading the reviews it was going to be at the very least an ""average"" macha. NOT SO...it was stale and dull like it was VERY OLD and as if it was left out. I have purchased less expesive machas from Taiwan and have been happy with the product. Appearntly healthway buys this in bulk and they do not have any quality control. You can tell by the smell of the dried powder that the tea is obviously not acceptable to consume. I WILL BE DEMANDING A REFUND!!!!!!!!!! FYI want the best bang for your buck Id buy - Vita Life Matcha."
5.0,energy drink that tastes good,"This is the perfect energy drink: it's not too sweet,it's not too sour or taste like medicine and best of all it's 8 oz ( instead of having to force down a 12-16 oz energy drink. It really is the best tasting drink out there."
5.0,makes a lot of Senso to buy this stuff from Amazon!!,"Great Deal on the Pods. Wife uses them in our single cup maker. We've also set up for subscription shopping. We get a great cup of coffee every day, get a great price, and have it shipped to our home every other month. We never run out.  Great Flavor, great price."
5.0,Superb,This is our favorite flavor of all of the Keurig choices. Just enough kick but still relatively mild.  Great price too!
1.0,FREAKING NASTY,"I love cotton candy and I have used cotton candy flavoring before. So I saw this and decided to get it to frost some cupcakes I am making right now. However, after i poured the packet in the frosting base (with a cloud of it that poofed all over!) and mixed the frosting, before I even tasted it I knew it would be nasty. It smelled strongly of chemicals! And it tastes like some sugar substitute chlorine. Not even a bit like cotton candy, just SO GROSS. I am so mad I bought this, it was more money than normal frosting and is so disgusting.  DO NOT GET COTTON CANDY.  Also, I have heard some other flavors are gross too. I am not even going to try any others, this one was so bad that there is no possible way any other little packet would taste good."
1.0,WAY overpriced!,"With shipping, these come to more than 28 cents a piece. At Cracker Barrel, they are less than 13 cents a piece (8 for a dollar). Eighty sticks would be $10 (and no high shipping cost). At Cracker Barrel, you don't have to worry about broken candy and they are always fresh. Cracker Barrel is where I'll be getting mine for the candy buffet for my daughter's wedding!!!"
5.0,Excellent Product!,"We were using Postum & it was discontinued, so I decided to search the internet for something else. To my surprise I found something much better.  My friend is very hard to please when it comes to taste and to my surprise he loves it. We are really enjoying this product. We can't have caffiene & this is just perfect for us.  Also, we were very pleased with the quanity & price.  Thanks alot, Zena Malone Memphis,TN"
5.0,yummy,It's nice to get these so much cheaper online. They're a great healthy snack to have around the house.
1.0,my baby had to be rushed to ER,MY lo had to be rushed to the ER!!! Allergic Reaction after this Formula. Her entire Body was swollen. Never had any problems with any other Formula....PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!
1.0,HORRIBLE tasting,"I bought this for my 15 month old son who has become a VERY picky eater.  I wanted a fun and easy way to make sure he gets his fruit and vegetable servings each day.  This does NOT do the trick!  He took one suck, made a horrible face, and has refused it since.  I tried it thinking it couldn't be THAT bad.  It was.  Terribly bitter (just the thought makes my mouth water) and runny.  No wonder he wouldn't eat it.  I wouldn't either!  I did buy some of the other varieties offered by HappyBaby and he loves them.  I think this is just a bad taste combo.  Yuck!"
1.0,not what i thought,I should have read more closely.  This is dried packet of mix that can be added to yogurt or milk.  Not what I wanted.  I am going to have give them away to so someone with a 'new eater'.  Missed the mark for me.
5.0,Amazing taste & perfect flavor combination-just WOW!,"We generally are fans of Indian and Thai curries, and like to experiment with different flavors/ethnic cuisines. Unfortunately, many of the pre-mixed curry sauces win up providing a decent 'base' but often require additional 'enhancements' based on our tastes. This 'Prima Taste Rendang Curry' needed absolutely nothing to enhance the flavor. We could not believe how perfectly balanced, smooth, savory and sweet/spicey this combination tasted. While 'beef' was the listed ingredient to be added, we already had chicken thawed out, so we used that instead. This was literally the perfect weeknight 'quick and easy meal' that provided for a surprise ethnic burst, without a lot of fuss. We cooked the whole meal, including rice, and the chicken/sauce in a very short amount of time-the rice in the rice cooker took longer than the chicken/sauce. I would DEFINITELY keep this in the cabinet to prepare again for ourselves and for guests...and soon! Highly recommended and yummy!"
1.0,no bueno,This is probably the worst candy I have ever had it's really hard ropes and taste and smell like crayon!
1.0,Very disappoined,"I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said this is ""sometimes really bad.""  This shipment of crystallized ginger is old, dry & disgusting! And I have 5 lbs of it!  This quality is horrible, & I cannot eat it.  This was my first purchase from Bayside Candies.  I love crystallized ginger, and this was the better deal with 5 lbs for approx. $20.  I have bought this ginger from Amazon before, but from a different company.  The other company's was $9 for only 16 oz.  It was fresh and delicious.  I am very disappointed with my purchase.  I could kick myself!"
5.0,Delicious,"I have been searching for the ""perfect"" carrot ginger dressings, and this ii it! Not to mention that it's actually healthy for you. My husband is a picky eater and even he loves the dressing."
1.0,Not as good as before,The product quality has slipped. It used to be made well with quality ingredients. The manufacturer should focus on quality control and product consistency.
5.0,Hard to fine but worth the effort,These pretzels are so good.  I used to buy them in my local grocery store but they discontinued carrying them.  Amazon came through and I thank them dearly.  These pretzels have the best flavor and crunch!
1.0,Great Product but Dented Cans,These are uncertified (no DOP) San Marzano tomatoes.  All 3 recent shipments had over 2/3 of the cans dented.  Amazon is aware of the problem and so is Mangia.  Don't worry about the label. The tomatoes are fantastic but only one star because the dented cans are unsafe and a potential health hazard.  Consumer Reports and others do not recommend consuming food from dented cans because of the health risk.  The risk is not worth it even if sold at 1/2 price.  Amazon needs to correct the shipment problem of dented cans!
1.0,Aspartame!!!!,I am so disappointed that the company switched last July from using sucralose (splenda) as the sweetener to aspartame!  Yuck!!!  I loved this tea and drank it all day.  NO MORE!!!  I have no idea why a company would switch like that and I hope they change it back!
1.0,Must use conditioner for scalp benefits and SMELLS TERRIBLE,"I wanted to try this product because some members of our family have easily irritated scalps.  We were very disappointed.  First, the bottle indicates that the scalp benefits are only indicated when the conditioner is also used, so I bet the shampoo does little or nothing to help your scalp.  The other thing is that the shampoo smells awful and everyone refused to use it.  Pros: It might help your scalp, but only if you use the conditioner  Cons: Have to use the condition to get scalp benefits. Smells terrible."
5.0,wonderful product,this product has always arrived on time never been any issues. i switched to this brand from a perscription only brand and it works just as good but less cost than the perscription only one. my cat's urine hasn't smelled like amonia since i started using this and havent had any accidents outside the litter box unlike before. Love this product!!
5.0,nantucket review,Have tried most all of the k - cup types of coffee and have decided that the nantucket blend is the best tasting cup of coffee available anywhere. Always a perfect taste and very good mouth appeal . LOVE THIS COFFEE !!!!
5.0,No Complaints From Me!!!,Nestle Pure Life is one of three bottle waters I drink....  This water has a very smooth taste unlike some bottled water that taste very harsh going down..  I know its very important to get your water intake in.. you can't go wrong with Nestle Pure Life...
5.0,Gorgeous!,"I've never seen another schilleriana with such beautiful, bold foliage! This is a amazing hybrid and I can't wait to see the flowers! Also the plant was very healthy and had great roots."
5.0,Godiva Lover,I love chocolate and this is the absolute best!  The box is very nice too.
5.0,enjoy this brand of coffee,"I am pleased with this brand of coffee, great flavor and no waste with the great design. Will be one of my favorite blends now."
5.0,Smooth organic chocolate with a semi-sweet taste,"I love dark chocolate, so I was excited to try this Newman's Own Dark Chocolate bar.  First, I was impressed that the bar, which is smaller than other specialty chocolate bars but still a generous six squares, is just a single serving size.  At 330 calories, 22 grams of fat, and 28 grams of sugar, it is still an indulgent treat, but if you choose to share the bar (as I did), you can satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling too guilty about it.  I definitely enjoyed the taste of this bar as well; I found the chocolate to be rich and smooth.  At 54% cocoa, it is definitely not as dark as many other dark chocolate offerings out there--in fact, I found the taste to be a bit sweeter, more reminiscent of semi-sweet chocolate than true dark chocolate.  Although this was fine by me, some dark chocolate lovers may be disappointed.  So, unless you need your dark chocolate to be of the extra-dark variety, I would definitely recommend this product."
1.0,Too Expensive,I found the same box of Dove dark chocolate bars at a local bulk warehouse store for 35% less and didn't have to pay the extraordinarily high shipping to boot which put this box at 100% more than what it costs to buy it locally.  Go figure why this seller doesn't offer it thru Prime.  The box of chocolate we bought from this seller arrived melted which caused everything to separate once it cooled.  Do what I did and shop around... unless you live somewhere you have to buy it over the internet.
5.0,Pocari Sweat,"This was my favourite drink while I was living in Japan, I used to drink practically a gallon a day.  The mix is great! Just go light on filling the pitcher with water, it gets watered down easily."
1.0,"Cadet Large Bully Sticks, 1 lb.","I decided to find these locally, and am very glad I did.  The bag of ""large"" bully sticks is anything but.  There were mixed sizes, many considerably smaller than a pencil.  The pet store wanted $39 and change for the bag. So, if you need the thicker bully sticks for a heavy duty chewer, you'd be better off looking else where."
5.0,Great Product!,I've been using these a few years now and will not use anything else. They always burn for a full three hours and don't have any of the typical chemical smell you get with other fire logs.
1.0,Don't waste your money on these bones,I will never buy another pedigree jumbone or any other pedigree product for that matter. The jumbone made my dog very sick. He had dieria for two days from it.
1.0,$7? Walgreen sells it for $5,"I'm looking to order this and the price appears to be way to high. On the search result page (search for Lindor troufle white chalocalate), the price is $5.5. But if you view the item, the price is $7. At Walgreen, it's $5. The 4 pack  Lindt Lindor Truffles White Chocolate (12-Count), 5.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)  is even worst, it comes out to $8.75 per bag.  I am going to order  Lindt Lindor Truffles White Chocolate, 120-Count Box , it comes out to about $3 per 5.1 ounce."
5.0,Great for older cars that need the benefit of Glucosamine & chondroitin,"My cat is 13 years old and didn't move around as well as he used to. A friend of mine had great results taking human glucosamine and chondroitin supplements. We looked at the natural supplements available- and there was no way that my cat was going to let me give him pills everyday, unless I wanted to be shredded and bit(he is a bit feisty about meds). These treats, given only 3 small ones a day are the perfect answer. He will jump on my lap to get to these, he loves them (and he is kinda picky). He does seem to be moving a lot better these days."
1.0,"Good product, bad vendor",Last shipment was full of bugs.  Not getting any more.  Maybe I was just unlucky but there was no excuse for this.
1.0,Major Disappointment ... Stale and Yucky,"The 0810 sell buy date on the packets is a FAIL, these are already past their prime. I will not purchase this again.  Nice big walnut and pecan halves perked up my taste buds. However, the nuts in this mixture were STALE and made the overall mix taste yucky. The rancid taste had permeated even the cranberries, raisins etc. Needless to say my healthy TV snacks were a major disappointment."
5.0,Awesome colic/reflux formula,"My LO has had reflux and fussiness since about his first week.  He was having difficulty nursing, wouldn't take a bottle and would throw up what he did get down.  He was prescribed Prevacid, which helped but he cried for 6 hours straight after having it so we stopped and just dealt with the fussiness and crying.  He was on BM and Nutramigen from about 3 weeks old until 6 weeks, when he then refused to eat.  We researched and switched to GS Soothe, and within 24 hours he was a changed baby!  He still refluxes and has sour burps on occasion, but overall it is way more manageable. His awake times are much more interactive, he smiles and talks and doesn't cry abnormally.  We love this formula, and use it along with BM."
5.0,"Amazing taste, excellent 'green cred'!","From my first bite, I was in love with Green & Black's Maya Gold! Both the orange & spices, as well as the chocolate are smooth and just intense enough. Nothing chunky, chewy, crunchy, or gummy in here! Just pure, fair trade, vegan goodness! The flavor is so delicious and satisfying that you can really get that 'chocolate relief' from one itty-bitty piece. The bars are so yummy, that you wanna eat more, though! We're always sure to have at least one bar in the house (although it does go quickly!) these 3-bar packs make it easier to share :)  Yum!  I rely on reviews here at Amazon to help me make informed buying choices. I hope this review has helped you in the same manner. If you voted this as helpful, I Thank You! :)"
5.0,I now believe in God...,"I live in South Korea, and needless to say, these suckers are extremely hard to find (if not impossible). Even though I live far away, the package arrived very quickly (quicker than most items of this size would), and the blowpops taste as perfect as they did in the U.S.  Enjoying this candy, I could be shot in the face tomorrow and STILL die a happy man, knowing that on my shelf, in my room, next to a picture of my family and others, is a beautiful, gorgeous 100ct. box of Charms Blowpops."
1.0,Worst product EVER,"Do NOT buy this! My cats wouldn't eat it, and within two days, I figured out why. I took it out of the bag, and there was MOLD ALL OVER IT!!"
5.0,Awesome supplier,I've ordered from Amazon before and I still get amazed by how conscientious they are.  I bought this as a Christmas gift for relatives up in Michigan.  The delivery was very quick and even though the box was damaged the product was fine.  Supplier was quick to ship an additional box of tea to the address in Michigan and it didn't cost me anything.  Amazon is truly amazing!  Buy from them!!
5.0,Cindi O,"This product i first found in a grocery store.. I love it sooooo much, I decided to see if Amazon sells it.... Well, they did and I have been buying it ever since.. Love the way it tastes in  my coffee and by the way, my favorite is the Mocha... dont care for the other flavors....Great buy on Amazon"
1.0,loses taste fast!!!!,"this gum is the worst i have ever purchased, plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone!"
1.0,This is not exactly a can of jalape&ntilde;os...,"So, the top inch or so of the can is sliced CARROTS, not jalape&ntilde;os as the labeling might somehow suggest (ok, seriously, it says ""sliced jalape&ntilde;os"").  There is a bunch of other junk mixed in, including bay leaves, onions, etc., which interfere with using these in anything you JUST wanted jalape&ntilde;os in!  So, lesson learned:  Pay for work, get sleep; pay for jalape&ntilde;os, get carrots..."
5.0,"If you like ""diet"" iced tea but don't want caffeine, buy this now","Even major supermarkets don't regularly sell artificially-sweetened decaffeinated iced tea, and they almost never have it ""out of season"", i.e., when it isn't summertime.  Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't even always have it, so if you are an iced tea drinker who wants your iced tea throughout the day and into the evening, buy this when it is available."
1.0,Chemical taste..,"This color came with a short lived expiration date. . could be the nature of the product, not sure, and it had a chemical taste when used in baking goods, again, could be nature of the product.  I wont' be using it in my Red Velvet Cakes, I threw the bottle out."
5.0,Wonderful and Healthy Chocolate,"First off, I have to admit the guy who thought it actually contained bat and wrote a review is hilarious. Read it if you are looking for a laugh. Otherwise, considering this chocolate is supporting an endangered species of animal the manufacturing is amazing! This is the best dark chocolate I have ever had. And the nutrition facts aren't that bad either considering this is candy."
1.0,Nothing but HYPE..! Cost more then gasoline.,"Did anyone realize that this so-called beneficial water costs WAY MORE then gasoline? It cost $23.04 a gallon for this water..! What was I thinking when I bought and tried it? I just got caught up on the RHWNJ hype and lost my mind and money in the meantime. We complain about the $4.00+ a gallon high gas prices but some of us bought into this horrible BLK water hype. Fortunately I only bought one to try. BTW..it's horrible and nasty tasting. Save your money and use regular tap water or regular bottled water, your wallet will be much happier."
5.0,Splendid,I greatly appreciate the speed of delivery and quality of the alfalfa sprouts I purchased.  Excellent company!  I love growing sprouts!  Thank you!
5.0,Happy with the cherries,"I ordered these to make a sour cherry chutney and love these.  In fact, I'll be ordering them again when this supply runs out!"
1.0,Tastes of Death (Peppered),"I got the peppered flavor and it tastes awful.  It's spicy as heck but the pepper taste is so overwhelming that it totally ruins it.  I got through about half a bag and not more then 2 pieces at a time.  Totally disgusting.  I like beef jerky and Jack Link's especially, just not this flavor.  Anyone who is a health nut may not like this because it's loaded with MSG, though I think most beef jerky is."
5.0,hands down better than the mass produced stuff.....,"The difference between high fructose corn syrup and suger is that sugar tastes natural and your body knows its limits. With high fructose corn syrup the opposite is true, it taste synthetic and the after taste is designed to leave you wanting more and it actually causes some issues for people, now the reason I started my review with a comparison of HFCS vs sugar is because no where is it more evident than regular dr peper vs dublin dr pepper. Many of the reviewers have said that this is heaven and while I won't go that far I can tell you with a 4 person taste test this stuff destroys the regular formula out on the market. To tell you how I know its simple, the 4 person taste test team took a regular super market can of dr. pepper(they don't make it in glass anymore) each poured out a small sampling 2 fl ounces, and tasted, each of us had the same prognosis, its way to carbonated and the flavor bites at the tongue, its almost like the tongue and the soda is having a fight and the soda is winning, to continue the test we washed out our mouths with water and did the same with the cups, then after 5 minutes we did the same with the dublin dr pepper, never in my life have I tried this stuff and I can tell you that even though its an expensive habit the soda is satisfying, not only is it smooth its not overly sweet and it does not assault the tongue instead it tastes like how dr pepper should taste and I am converted... I probably should have also mentioned that until I tried ddp I hated the taste of dr pepper they converted me the only complaint is the company that sold it to me ""thebargainbox"" needs to take some lessons in packaging their shipments one of the bottles had broken during shipment and soaked the box in ddp, and it picked up the smells of the warehouse not pleasant. Continuing on everyone in the 4 person group fell in love with this soda and now are planning on picking it up sometime in the future. Instead of suing them snapple should be selling dublin dr. pepper in every freaking store this this stuff would put everyone else out of business.  Now its time for the imnportant information, because I know as someone who is trying to watch his weight a little bit I pay attention to this stuff here are the details on the back of the bottle, serving size is 1 8oz bottle. Calorie count: 100 Calories from fat: 0 Sodium count: 35mg total carbs: 27g Sugars: 27g protein: 0  ingredients: water,imperial pure cane sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, natural and artificial flavoring, sodium benozate(preservative), caffeine  To be more specific this stuff is almost the same calorie count as the 7.5 ounce 90 calorie cans you can buy in any local food store with a much, much, much, much better taste.  If you can force yourself to like regular dr pepper in the store then you absolutely must try dublin dr pepper its better for you and tastes incredible."
1.0,Not for me,"This tastes like sour grass. I ordered it by mistake --- the powdered milk is delicious, wonderful, but the evaporated milk, even amended, watered, mixed with fresh goat's milk, is astringent, and hard."
1.0,Dry and Dreadful,I found this product to be dry with extremely minute particles.  Not flavorful at all.  I will not buy this product again.
5.0,awesome product!,"the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like Newman's-- I can;t find it in my area at all, and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her IBS and preservative sensitivities.   Easy and cost effective.  I only wrestle with the CO2 footprint on having it to be shipped :((  And am working on finding an offset for that. !! :)"
1.0,Not Fresh,This product was not fresh and had very little flavor. Also had hard chunks of what appeared to be stems. Very dissapointed.
1.0,These are not Green Lentils -,All the labeling says - green Lentils... but lentils inside the box are brown in color --- and I am not colorblind.  I was after the green lentils because green lentils contain is more nutritious (more than 3-to-1) than brown and red lentils.
1.0,Do not buy from Amazon,"The product deserves 5 stars, Amazon's packaging deserves 0 stars. Amazon ships sturdy books with more protective packaging than these delicate biscuits had (they were in a cardboard sleeve).  Instead of getting a box of six biscuits, I got a box of crumbs. I wish I were exaggerating, but not one biscuit was even half intact. This was a complete waste of money, and a complete disappointment. I'll buy Viennese Whirls again, but not from Amazon."
1.0,"Too thick, not great tasting",These are sickeningly thick and the flavor would be moderately okay if it didn't have the nasty consistency.  I took a sip and handed it to my spouse it was so bad... who then took a drink and poured it down the sink.  I have only tried the chocolate as it was so bad I'm hesitant to try any of the others.
1.0,post script on veg powder,"On  the Barry Farm Foods website, instead of listing ""yeast extract"" as on the package, they list ""autolyzed yeast"", a toxic substance that is in the same family as MSG."
1.0,Terrible,I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal for years. I like most of the flavors ( even the plain ) and the banana cream is wonderful but they only sell it in the variety pack. I figured this would taste just as good as the banana cream so I ordered it. That was a mistake. This was terrible ! It had almost no taste and the taste it had was that of a diet after-taste. That's the only way to explain it. It has a chemical and paste taste...if that makes sense. I thought of donating it to my local foodbank but I feel bad giving such a terrible tasting product to a family in need.
1.0,not straightforward about allergen information,"My daughter is extremely sensitive to gluten so many products that promote themselves as gluten free prove to be otherwise when my daughter has a gluten reaction.  For the sake of keeping my daughter healthy I contact companies asking them if they test for gluten and if gluten is processed in the same facility.  If it is then it is almost certainly contaminated.  Most companies give me a detailed and open answer so that I can make the best decision for my daughter.  They don't assume they know if the product is okay for my daughter or not.  They give me the facts and the numbers and let me make my own decision.  Larabar did NOT give me a clear answer.  They gave me a very vague answer assuring me that they went through stringent testing but they did not say what kind of testing.  They also said their products met the FDA requirements for gluten free which is so BOGUS b/c the FDA currently does not have any sort of requirements or enforcements for gluten free labels.  They are proposing implementing one but have not yet done so.  So Larabar is attempting to deceive me.  They also did not answer my question if gluten was also processed in the facilities that process Larabars.  Again, most other companies answer me directly on this and are very helpful.  I was so turned off by Larabar's response that I want nothing to do with them.  It was obvious they could care less about my daughter's health.  Ultimately, they put their profits above children's health."
5.0,Doggy Likes!,"My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.  That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?  Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his  Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables  (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.  I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.  For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.  I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.  Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats."
1.0,AWFUL!!,"Do not be fooled by the ""British Blend"" label, this is not British tea! We Brits like our tea with a lot of flavour. I frequently purchase Tetleys decaf tea in the UK and this does not even compare. It is weak and tasteless and even doubling the amount of tea bags per cup doesn't work. Perhaps the regular decaf is better but in my opinion, if you like a more full bodied tea experience,this is not for you."
1.0,"never shipped, never received",We ordered this right before a move to Africa and this was to go into our shipment. It was a busy time and we never noticed it not arriving. I unpacked out crate today and it is not here. The tracking on UPS says a label was created but nothing after that. The real problem is now finding a way to talk to someone at Amazon about this.
5.0,So good,"I was disappointed when I couldn't have my usual vanilla cappucino anymore. Not available in decaf.  This is better than I had hoped for. Decaf,sugarfree and delicious! Now I can again start the day with my morning cappucino."
5.0,super rich,"MMMMMMMM, this was too yummy!! MUST be a chocolate lover to have this cause it's VERY chocolatey and thick and super rich. If it's too much, I guess you could add more milk, but then you might as well buy cocoa."
5.0,Udi's Cinnamon & Raisin is de-lish!,"I buy the cinnamon & raisin bread, which I love, at Krogers for $5.99 a loaf plus a tax of 9.75%.I am going to order a case of 8 from Amazon at $5.25 a loaf with free shipping and no tax. When I go out for breakfast with my hubby at our favorite resturant, I take a couple of slices with me and they toast it for me as they don't serve gluten free meals. I've tried the frozen gluten free breads but I feel they are too dense and heavy."
1.0,Amazingly salty (in a bad way),"I bought this salmon, attracted by the ""Skinless & Boneless"" label (I usually buy the alaskan salmon from Crown Prince). Let's just say that this was a huge mistake. This salmon has 630 mg of sodium per can, and while that doesn't sound like much, the salmon is amazingly salty. If you intend to use it in your cooking, perhaps this would be alright, however, it is impossible to eat as is. This salmon also smells less like salmon, and more like some other kind of fish (which really does not appeal to me much - if I wanted some other fish, I would have gotten it). Basically, right now I'm stuck with 11 cans of salmon that I really have no use for (the first can that I opened made it quite clear that it's the last can I would open). Unfortunately, I don't have a cat. Will look for a food drive to donate this expensive disaster."
5.0,TOO GOOD FOR WORDS!,THESE MACAROONS ARE BETTER THAN THE NON-VEGAN/RAW ONES! I SWEAR IT! THE BLONDES TOO - THEY TASTE LIKE THEY'RE MADE WITH BUTTER. TRULY A GREAT PRODUCT! BUY PEOPLE AND YOU'LL BE HOOKED (IN A GOOD WAY)
5.0,Coffee,The Coffee is in a great size because I love coffee and I live at a Boarding School. I am only alowed to leave on some days and this is a great size for me. The shipping is resonibly fast and when it gets here I will have plenty of coffee to last me a while. Personally I drink 3-5 cups a day and this price is a great deal rather than Walmart 8 packets for 7 dollars or 50 packets for 28 dollars. Personally I think this price is a great deal. The seller has shipped my item about 30 min after I ordered it. It will be here very soon on free standard shipping.
1.0,Don't buy this unless you have no other option,"I've been buying this because my husband and I are both lactose intolerant and who wants their baby to be fussy if she doesn't have to be? Two months after starting this formula my baby had jumped from 15th percentile in weight to 90th percentile in weight while still just 15th percentile in height. No one in our family is obese. Today I looked at the ingredient list, first is corn syrup and second is sugar!!! It's not that way on the regular simulac formula. This stuff is horrible, I can't believe I've been poisoning my baby with it!"
5.0,tastes like the real stuff,"My son developed gluten intolerance at 16.  He knows what food is supposed to taste like.  This is his favorite pasta.  I'm very happy Amazon makes it easy for families with celiacs to find ""normal"" tasting food."
1.0,Bad batch?,"Cadbury's drinking chocolate is my absolute favorite; deliciously, decadent goodness. However I was extremely disappointed when I ordered this pack and opened a container that was no good. On receiving my complaint, Amazon's customer service was excellent. They immediately issued a full refund and helped facilitate purchase of replacement."
5.0,easiest way to create a fancy small-plate menu item,Empty the contents of this can into a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the oil starts to pop. Serve hot over slices of bread. Pretty yellow color + perfect spicy garlic bite + octopus = perfect.
1.0,"If it has no cocoa, it's not hot chocolate.","Taste is OK for kids, but this should be called ""Halloween Artificially Colored and Flavored Sweet Drink."" No surprise on the Yellow #6, of course...but really, can you call it ""Hot Chocolate"" without even a hint of cocoa in the mix? Not in my book. Rename it and maybe it'll go up to a three-star concoction. Maybe."
5.0,Nestle Nido from Chile best powder milk in 48 years of milk drinking,"Nestle Nido made in Chile Ingredients, Whole milk, soy Lecithin ( emulsification properties ), Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3. I did a three milk blind taste test. I mixed nonfat milk from a large country wide grocery store chain by the directions, Mixed Nestle Nido from Chile by the directions, and bought a pint of whole milk from a country wide dairy. I left the milks in the fridge over night in uncoverd identical marked glasses . This was to give them time to rest. The next day a friend blindfolded me and the test began. First a whole milk that was very good. Washed mouth and the second milk was nonfat. Easy pick taste like most nonfat powderd milk. Washed mouth. Tried third glass and was stumped. I sipped both whole milks and could tell one was fresher. I picked the fresher as the store bought and was wrong. The best was Nido from Chile. I have had two years chef prep and years cooking in the field. It is my assumption that the store bought had picked up flavor from the carton. I will keep Nestle Nido from chile as a back up and for emergency stock. I also boiled both whole milks and found the Nido performs as well as store bought. One thing to remember is to make sure the country Nido comes from does not add sugers or other flavorings to cover a bad product. Pricey but good for emergency or every day use if you through out spoiled milk."
1.0,I say: No no no,"Premium coffee: No Worth the price: No Worth to buy agan: No  There are better alternatives: Douwe Egberts Pure Gold or Jacobs Cronat Gold are way better choices, more tasty and less expensive!"
1.0,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Do not buy!! I did some research on brown rice syrup (#1 ingredient in this formula) and studies show that dangerous amounts of arsenic were found in organic powdered baby formula, intended for toddlers, whose top ingredient was brown rice syrup. These formulas contained six times more arsenic than the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe for the water supply. It seems there are no safe toddler formulas anymore.. Enfagrow used to be my choice, but they changed to high fructose corn syrup and almost doubled the amount of sugar in their formula... I am a firm believer that everything is okay in moderation, even high fructose corn syrup, but this is not needed in a toddler formula that they will be consuming many ounces of each day....I think I will just stick with Horizon Organic Milk with DHA and OMEGA 3... I will just have to get my daughter some iron in her foods that she is fed though out the day... I breastfed all of my children until they were 1, but liked to give them the toddler formula after they turned 1 in order to get the iron that they needed. Just think twice before purchasing any of these toddler formulas!!"
5.0,Crunchy and delicious,"These chips taste great. They're a little salty and pretty expensive, but make a great treat. I serve them instead of potato chips for an interesting, different snack."
1.0,OLD FLOUR,"When I received this flour it was almost at its expiration date.  It already had a rancid smell.  I have bought millet flour elsewhere to ensure I received fresh flour.  For the price you pay for the flour, you would think the manufacturer would not sell old flour at full price.  I hope amazon does a little more to ensure the company is not selling old grocery items to its customers."
1.0,Awful,This is without a doubt the worst concoction that we have ever tried and I am amazed that anyone can stomach it. Nothing but a bland mix of goo with tons of pepper and spices added to cover it up. Same applies to the other Shore Lunch meals we tried! Do yourself a favor and leave them alone!
1.0,U.S. grown figs,"I first had fresh figs in Moscow. They were plump, juicy, fantastic. Thinking that I wanted more fresh figs without going back to Moscow, I ordered these on line. Bad move. They were terrible. Absolutely nothing like the ones I loved. We threw them out. I wanted to rate them a zero, but the program for these responses will not let me do that."
1.0,Not a saving.  Period,How could this save us as customers while Target sells for $5.99/bottle or Babies R Us for $6.49/bottle?  The product itself is awesome.  My baby loves it.  It is really ready to use.
1.0,Dislike the taste of this product.,"This product has a very strong taste that overpowers everything that I have used with it.  I had never purchased blackstrap molasses before, but after this batch, I will likely never purchase them again."
1.0,ship date 5-7 Weeks out???,I'd order this today without the 5 to SEVEN week ship date estimate. PRIME??? How is this Prime Membership? Prime is supposed to be at your door within 2-3 DAYs. This doesn't even SHIP for 5 to & WEEKS?? How is this relevant to Prime membership?
1.0,Something's wrong with this coffee,These K-cups are either extremely old or they're not authentic Green Mountain K-cups. The coffee is weak and has a bad after-taste. Both my spouse and I have noticed this independently of each other.  I tried to contact the seller to ask about this but couldn't figure out who it was.
5.0,Miss...,Today I received a care package with two cans Cafe Du Monde in it.  It has been several months since my last cup.  Being deployed and taking my first sip helped me forget where I am.  This coffee is delicious and helps me remember the good ole U.S. of A.
5.0,Libby's sliced carrots,"These carrots are so rich in color and I love being able to buy a case at a time and have them delivered to my door. Great taste, wonderful for soups and any other dish you would like to create. Cooking can be such fun and the color and taste of these carrots will add delight to any meal.."
5.0,Newman's Special Blend for keurig Brewers,"I love waking-up to a fabulous cup of coffee.  Newman's special blend Arabica coffee for me leaves nothing to be desired;  taste, aroma, boldness and ease of preparation make this a daily morning must have.  I would certainly recommend that if you are a coffee lover, that you give it a try.  I think it's the best thing since sliced bread.  And Amazon is the way to go, I order when I'm running low and it is at my doorstep the following day.  Really, I don't see how anyone can ask for more."
5.0,Fresh and tasty,"Checked reviews about several Companies this one had great ones. Purchased as a gift for my Mother( she is the expert on Jordan Almonds ) She said they were wonderful. Fresh and not over candied. My sisters agreed. They arrived right away, well packed."
1.0,If you like stale donuts...,"These were fresh K-cups, far from their ""best by"" date, not old ones. But to the extent that there was chocolate flavoring, it just wasn't pleasant, tasted stale to me. I won't buy these again."
1.0,STALE WALNUTS,I HAVE PURCHASED NUMEROUS WALNUTS FROM AMAZON BY DIFFERENT VENDORS AND THEY WERE GREAT.  THESE WERE AWFUL.  I PUT THEM IN THE FREEZER BEFORE I OPENED THEM FOR FRESHNESS.  WHEN I OPENED THEM MOST WERE STALE.  HAD TO THROW ALL SIX BAGS IN THE TRASH.  WILL NOT ORDER THESE AGAIN.  A WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY.
1.0,Decaffeinated!!,"I recently bought this item based on the good reviews I saw here. However, I was dismayed to learn that this tea is actually decaffeinated! This fact is hidden on the back of the box, while it should be in the product's name."
1.0,I DO NOT recommend buying this product!!!!,"Since being diagnosed with a gluten sensitivity I have been searching for a gluten-free product to take the place of my long time favorite side, Velveeta Shells and Cheese. This is not it. When we began cooking this product I was very hopeful due to the taste of the noodles, then we added the ""Mac & Cheese seasoning"". The title alone should have thrown up a red flag, however we felt obligated to try it anyways. I wish I had taken a picture of my face upon tasting this product. It may well have been the most disgusting attempt at a cheese sauce I have ever encountered. After tasting how foul this product was I offered it to my 70lb dog, whom has been known to eat anything; at which time he proceeded to sniff, taste, and walk away. In the almost 2 years I have owned this dog this is the first thing that he has turned down. I strongly suggest paying the extra money to have Annie's Homegrown Creamy Deluxe Macaroni Dinner."
1.0,Washed Washed Washed,These seeds got to me very quickly ...And for cooking I'm sure there fine...But they are very clean seeds washed washed washed ...No taste... no oil....Might as well buy them from the supermarket...Complete TEA USELESS....I think some of the other reviewers may work for the company....Look Elsewhere folks....
1.0,Inferior Milk Kefir Grains,"The kefir grains were delivered promptly so there was no issue with that. However! The milk kefir that they produce is not what I would consider real milk kefir. I've previously made milk kefir from grains obtained through Marilyn ""Kefirlady"" and through the local leader of the Weston A. Price chapter. Both Kefirlady's and those obtained through Weston A. Price produced much better kefir. One of the main differences I could tell is that the kefir grains I've received from Cultures of Health do not create the ""slimy"" casing around the grains as I had experienced with other vendors. This leads me to believe that the grains are lacking some of the bacteria or yeasts that form the kefir grains. The taste is also not as sour as other previous grains. I understood that the first week or so of batches would not be up to par however I'm well past that. Personally, I'd recommend getting them from a different vendor as these are woefully inadequate at accomplishing their intended purpose. Looks like I'll have to be getting some new grains..."
5.0,Interestingly Addicting...and peanut free!,"I bought these on a whim.  I enjoy flax, use it in all my baking from breads to cookies.  I usually laugh when I read reviews about products and folks note how ""addicting"" the item is.  Ha ha jokes on me!  It is SO true with these.  They are not very sweet at all.  The flavor is very mild and subtle.  My kids like them for one piece.  I on the other hand, devoured the whole bag within a day!  I found myself just eating them for no reason than they tasted great.  They do taste flaxy there is no doubt about it.  I got this flavor thinking the kids would enjoy the sweetness, but I also want to try the BBQ one as well.  I put the other bags on a box and put them in the garage, too much of a good thing is just plain too much!  Will enjoy eating them again and again!  Plus, I confirmed with the manufacturer they have no peanuts in their plants so these as safe for people with peanut allergies!!!"
1.0,Be careful - this product is misrepresented,"Be careful with this one.  I thought I was buying what's pictured: a box of 6 packs of 12.  The low price should have been a giveaway, but I just figured it was old stock that they wanted to get rid of and I was only buying it to use in an activity in our Vacation Bible School.  When I received my one little box of 12 today, I went back to their amazon listing to see what happened, and sure enough, there is a warning that what's pictured is not a representation of what you're buying, and nowhere do they state exactly how many Fizzie tabs you're buying.  I wonder how many other people have been burned the same way.  If it's been a problem in the past, what they should do is post an accurate photo and accurate description.  Buyer beware.  I will NOT be buying anything from this merchant again."
5.0,Fat free dessert!,"I enjoy tea on a regular basis, but this is simply delicious!  I wouldn't go to it for my regular cup in the morning, but it is great just about any other time!  It is like having a liquid cupcake!"
1.0,Awful,I remember eating Gaucho cookies when I was young and I was hoping to find them here.  Unfortunately this was not to be.  They tasted fake and I wound up throwing them out.  Cannot recomend.
1.0,"Sorry, didn't work","Sorry but my dog would not touch anything with this on it. I had to discard it. It was delivered in a timely manner, however. It may not be the product, but all I know is that it did not work for me."
5.0,Yummy,I keep these honey sticks around for a quick snack when my sweet tooth comes a-calling.  Just one or two and I'm satisfied.
1.0,Asked for One Coffee and got something else,I ordered a 3 pack of TASTERS CHOICE FRENCH ROAST Instant Coffee and got 3 pack of TASTERS CHOICE DECAFF instant coffee.  I have been ordering on Amazon for a long time and suddenly I have now received two orders that were NOT WHAT I ORDERED. What's going on guys?
5.0,Great food,"This is the ONLY dog food my Shepherd mix will eat.  For the 2 reviews above, your dogs are unique and prob. have an intolerance.  Evo is a wonderful food, Eukanuba has MANY things that are horrible for your dog to eat.  Evo has NO corn or by-products which are very bad for dogs. It is a high protein food so its not great for 7+ year old dogs but wonderful for normal adult dogs.  Perfect for dogs with grain allergies.  Whenever looking for food stay away from dog foods with ANY corn or by-products.  Eukanuba and Iams are CONSTANTLY recalling their food.  I work at a local pet shop and in the past year they have had recalls 5+ times, no other food has been recalled."
1.0,"Tried it once, but not twice",Product has taste and texture somewhere between a gummy bear and a strip of wet cardboard.  Lacks flavor and el dente texture.
1.0,Not so good....,"I LOVE Sahale snacks!  Especially the black peppered pistachio/almond/dried cherry mix (which is about impossible to find now) I ordered several different flavors of these snacks recently thru Amazon.  This one I can't stomach, though.  It reminds me of B.O. (Body Odor) Sounds crude, but it's that bad, in my opinion.  I'll continue to buy Sahale brand where ever I can.  Top notch products!  This one just has a putrid taste to me..."
1.0,Skimpy,"Very disappointed after I recieved this product. Since I got these for gifts, they look like I've eaten half of the candy! Would not recommend."
1.0,Unappealing to every sense.,"Ginger, lemon and honey seem a natural flavor combination. Unfortunately, this drink ends up being entirely unappealing -- it is a dirty brown color, it smells musty, and the taste is too strong and powdery. The only real positive is that at least the dry pellets dissolve quickly and completely in hot water, so the consistency is nice and even. I could not stand to take more than a couple sips."
5.0,GOOD TREAT FOR MY LAB,"We got these for my fiances lab (my lab too thru him) and we use them as occasional treats and for training purposes. For some reason, I thought they'd be bigger than they were, but I'm okay with the size that they are. I read that some people had bugs in their boxes, no bugs here!! Thank goodness!! She likes these treats, but she also eats deer poop in the backyard and anything on the floor, sooo I can't guarantee that the taste is great, but if she eats them, then that's all that matters! LoL. As humans, we'll never know, and I'm not trying them!"
5.0,Great Candy and Decoration,"The candy actually taste great, not dried out as might be expected.  I used these as decorations on top of cupcakes for a Hot Dog Party... everyone thought it was very cute and kids ate them like crazy."
5.0,schlepper bargain,"Love the terrific price for my every day cooking-why schlepp 1 litre cans when can store away enough for 5 months cooking.  My car is dead,and in Los Angeles this means a loser,so I'd rather shop as little as possible.  We adapt as mother time dictates,and father dollar demands.America=$.......Forget your pathetic academic arguments in utter denial of reality of how the real world works!!!!!! Money in Los Angeles is truly all that matters,especially for males under 45 years....cook and save your money,God knows you'll need it....Older gals really have to cut back,in every aspect of life...."
5.0,Good Review For a Gift,I sent this to my sister as a gift for the holidays and New Years Eve and the review from her was that she and all the guests at her house loved these before and after dinner liquor filled chocolates...... Nice gift to be shared with many people.
1.0,A Big Ripoff!,"I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real ""premium"" dog foods brag that they've no corn.  Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real ""premium"" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real ""premium"" dog foods do not have.  In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. Calling this stuff premium dog food would be like calling a Kia a Mercedes. For nearly the same price as this overpriced Alpo, one could buy organic dog food, free of preservatives, corn, and cheap by-products!"
5.0,This coffee rocks!,Our guests and i really loved this one! Big bold dark yummy! I am always amazed at the quality of these K cup coffees.
1.0,Couldn't stand the taste or smell,"I almost never write reviews, but I thought I would for this one.  I'm pretty open to tastes of anything, but something about the smell and taste of this product was really bad.  It tasted ""off"" almost.  I'm really disappointed because I had hoped to like it and I love fruity green teas, but this was NO GOOD.  I'd strongly recommend trying a sample of this (if possible) before buying.  Sorry Zhena's.... maybe I'll like another flavor.  I haven't given up on you yet."
5.0,sophia,"these noodles have virtually no taste so were exactly what I was looking for to fill me up on the hcg diet and just absorb what ever topping I put on them, very good"
1.0,"Not good for low carb, okay tasting",I've been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.  In my opinion the Atkins taste 100 times better then the think thin bars.  The Think Thin bars have 10 extra carbs then an Atkins bar.  They claim to be only 3 net carbs online but I think this is a lie.
1.0,Chicken by-product meal,"Chicken by-product meal, is crap and if you feed your dog this you don't care about your dog.Upgrade to the Lamb and Rice Naturals from the same company, Or Chicken and Rice. They are 4 star rated by DOGFOODADVISORS.COM"
1.0,tree raiting,The tree was frozen when it arrived and when it unthawed it died. I would not purchase again. Plus I did not get my money back or a new tree.
1.0,ghost chili,i bought the ghost chili package and water as needed but got no plant i had two of them and neither one came up?
5.0,this stuff is a god sent! amazing!,"My 2year old was constantly getting constipated and after a few every expensive vet visits, my vet found this food and told me about it. yes its expensive..but not as expensive as the emergency vet visits and all the pain my kitty was going thru! best food ever!"
1.0,Impregnated in oil - no raw cashew,"These cashew are impregnated with peanut and cotton seed oil and they taste like they were fried. I just was looking for real raw cashew (no salt , no nothing added) I will not buy them again."
5.0,Delicious,"I am lucky enough to be able to get to the Lancaster, PA area once or twice a year.  Jake and Amos is one of the brands I always purchase. They have so many delicious, jarred items I could write reviews for days!  But this is my favorite, so I thought I would concentrate on this one. They have a sweet and sour flavor that is addicting.  I may have never purchased them had I not received a sample at a farmer's market!  But they taste amazing, and even the sprout haters in my family like these. They have no fat or cholesterol, either.  And there is no preparation, when you want to serve them, just open the jar and put them out!  I like to serve them as a side dish with pork or as an alternative to cole slaw."
1.0,Undrinkable,"I love white chocolate and this is nothing like it.  When made according to directions, this tastes like water with some sugar and a little powdered milk in it.  If you use less water in an attempt to make it more flavorful, it still tastes terrible and has a nasty aftertaste.  After looking at the ingredients I understood why - they include the artificial sweetener sucralose.  Now I have to figure out what to do with two boxes of this awful stuff since even my kids won't drink it."
5.0,"a great product, creative, original, tasty.","Yes, as it says somewhere in the discription of the product, 'it is creative.'  A bit too creative  - the leading ingredient in the Bob's Red Mill Country Rice Mix is listed as  - wait for it: POTATOES.  You need to fix it, guys.  Ingredients Potatoes, Vegetable Oil (Contains One Or More Of The Folldwing: Corn, Cottonseed Or Sunflower Oil), Salt, Sugar, Dextrose, Torula Yeast, Onion And Garlic Powder,Citric Acid, Natural Smoke Flavor, Spice, Spice Extractives (Including Extractives Of Annatto, Turmeric, And Paprika). Contains: Wheat. Allergy Information: Manufactured On Equipment That Processes Products Containing Milk, Soy And Wheat."
1.0,Awful!,"I bought this product after hearing Dr. Oz tout how it 'changed his life.' Well, it also changed mine because for the first time ever, I threw away food that wasn't spoiled. In short, even with following the cooking directions, it was like eating paste -- only more bland despite how much garlic & olive oil I added. I tried to pawn a couple boxes off to my parents and they weren't happy with me. They donated their boxes to a food drive.  Money down the drain...don't buy (unless you have an affinity for eating paste)."
5.0,A GOOD PURE BREAKFAST and or SNACK with NO SIDE EFFECTS,"AS OF Sept. 20th, 2011, I REVISED MY STATEMENT ABOUT THE GREED OF AMAZON AND EREWHON!!  We are Happy to have, FINALLY, a GOOD HEALTHY CEREAL that is GREAT for Breakfast, and a SUPER ANYTIME SNACK, with NO SIDE EFFECTS! {remember folks, Do NOT LISTEN TO YOUR DOCTOR. They know NOTHING about Gluten and Dairy} If you eat this product, and have effects, it's the MILK your using. If they say your alergic to Gluten, you are alergic TO MILK and Dairy. I know.  Seems EVERY CEREAL these days contain Crap. Either dairy or a derivative of, gluten, which is NO GOOD for the body, even if your healthy, or Tons of Sugar, which NONE OF US NEED! So, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Product! Over 20 years of NO Breakfast Cereal, until this came along. BUT, PLEASE BEWARE of the OTHER CEREALS from this company. Especially if you have reactions to wheat or gluten.  For breakfast, use RICE MILK and a Fruit. Either banana or blueberries. Fresh Blueberries are the BEST when in season. Whatever you do, DON'T BUY BLUEBERRIES from the store right now. They are OLD and STALE and TASTELESS! Besides, they are RIPPING OFF THE PUBLIC. These stores DOUBLED THE PRICE and are giving LESS THAN HALF of what you normally get during season. Best is if you have a PICK YOUR OWN FARM in your area. Anyhow, I give this product 110% VOTE for GOODNESS! Thanks so MUCH for this product. (And a THANK YOU to Amazon for NOT BEING GREEDY about price and shipping. It's my HOPE that you keep it the way it is.) <----my statement in the beginning <------------------------- ****MY REVISION, Dated Sept. 20, 2011**********  Amazon and Erewhon GOT GREEDY! There prices ARE MUCH HIGHER than when we signed up. Seems each month now, the price GOES UP! And now, it's NOT WORTH Buying BULK, because we DON'T GET BULK PRICE anymore. So it's just as easy to go to the grocery store, and pay the 4.00/box, as opposed to buying 12 boxes, and still paying almost 4.00/box, here on Amazon. The box got pretty, BUT WE DON'T EAT THE DANG BOX! Matter of fact, we DON'T EVEN READ THE BOX. Sheeeez PEOPLE, GET REAL ALREADY! You can buy a box of rice crispies for HALF in the grocery store. And that cereal has all kinds of sugars and junk, which COSTS MORE $$. So tell me, how much does PLAIN BROWN RICE COST???????????????????  ""NOT HAPPY A CUSTOMER ANYMORE""!   Erewhon Crispy Brown Rice Cereal, Gluten Free, Organic, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) "
1.0,Why Do They Leave Rosemary Extract Out of Ingredients?,They are leaving the rosemary extract ingredient out of this product's ingredient summary.  If you have a small dog you may already know that if your dog is sensitive to rosemary it may result in seizures.  Makes me wonder why this important ingredient information is omitted.
5.0,Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar,Kashi TLC Chewy Granola Bar is every good tasting and very healthy for you.  The Honey Almond flax tastes super great.  The Granola Bar can make my stomach very satisfied.  I am not hungry for several hours.  It is nice to know my body is getting the right nutrition it needs. Kashi is a excellent company and has high quality food.
5.0,great,"Yes, these noodles are dried.  But they are also SO much better than anything else on the market.  Amd much less expensive than others online.  The Amish make some great food.  A shame I guess that you have to live close to them to enjoy it.  I live close to a Mennonite restaurant and they have the most awesome and reasonably priced food.  Just me I guess, but if they are closer to God than we are, than maybe we should listen because then God gives them the most awesome food."
5.0,meow mix,"Took a while for this to become available again, but now that it is, I ordered and it arrived quickly."
5.0,Delicious!,My mother brought me back this kind of rum cake after she visited Jamaica for a wedding. I had never had rum cake and I thought it would taste sort of nasty like raw rum had just been dumped into sweet cake batter. When I tasted it I was pleasantly surprised to note that it tasted nothing like I expected. I told myself I'd just take a couple of bites but before I knew  it I had consumed 3/4ths of it (giving the rest to my mom)! The whole cake is 400 calories so they should warn people! You cant take just one bite!:)
5.0,Energizing,"The combination of ginger, pepper and sarsaparilla is delicious and distinctive. This tea gives me energy without the negative side effects of caffeine. It's good any time, although I especially enjoy it for an afternoon lift."
5.0,Amazing,"These are amazing crepes!  I use them all the time now and they taste delicious! I'm a picky eater and can almost always taste when something lacks flavor as well as taste like it's full of preservatives.  These crepes are just the opposite and are super easy to store and make.  I was a little hesitant about the price but trust me, they're worth it at only 60 calories each!!"
5.0,YUMMY....Happy Hips-Chicken Treats!!!!,"I have Penny and Jake, they are 8 yrs old Shih Tzus and are very picky eaters.  Jake is diabetic and he always looks forward to his Chicken Treat after he has his insulin injection....he will hold still while Mommie ""shoots"" him.  His sister Penny gets a treat also for being a good sister and watching out for him. They LOVE them.  The service on ordering and receiving my order is excellent. Thank you for making safe, tasty and healthy treats for my babies. Brenda Pirtle"
5.0,bigelow tea chest,"I sent this as a gift.  My BFF loved it, thought it was beautiful."
1.0,Don't buy this coffee unless you want flavored water!,"We are completely disappointed with this coffee.  Wish we would have read the reviews before ordering.  Practically NO coffee in the k-cups; approx. 1/4th filled.  In two seconds, it turns to water flowing into cup.  We couldn't believe it.  Going back to Donut Shop coffee; theirs is totally full."
5.0,"Twizzlers, just bigger!",I got these for my girlfriend because she loves Twizzlers. I think she enjoyed them being larger because she can justify just having one or two and still getting twice as much candy. They are about 75% longer than a normal one so not quite double length. There are no other differences. Makes a good gift.
5.0,"super fast shipping, free samples","placed the order on tuesday, received it on saturday with the cheapest shipping; super faster. the himalayan salt comes in a sealed ziploc bag that has a bottom that allows it to sit up vertically which is convenient for storage especially if you have way too many spices and sacks of beans and sugars and what not like me. in addition, it came with 3 samples (himalayan salt, lemon citron flake salt, and cyprus white flake salt) weighing quite a few grams each (sorry, doesn't say the weight and i don't have a scale with me at the moment).  as far as product quality goes, i typically buy my himalayan salt from whole foods and aesthetically this salt look exactly like the salt i get from whole foods. i haven't tasted it yet, but i bet it tastes like salt. of course price wise this salt (the spice lab) is WAY cheaper than buying himalayan salt at whole foods (even including shipping)."
1.0,Not Powdered Eggs,"I bought this as powdered eggs, and could not return the product when I found that it was not what I wanted.  Now I'm out the money and don't know enough vegans to give the stuff away.  bfn"
5.0,OMG this stuff is good!,"OK - so I was expecting card board ... I like to joke about what my father-in-law once told me while he was attempting to diet:  here was his rule for staying thin, ""if it tastes like card board it is OK; if it tastes good, spit it out!""  This stuff tastes great.  It is very crunchy, and has a wholesome sweetness to it.  I loved it, the kids loved it, and my wife loved it.  I ate it every day until the box was empty.  Will you like it?  I can't say, because taste is well ... a matter of taste.  So you can make a mental comparison; here are some of my favorite cereals:  shredded mini wheat, golden grahams, and grape nuts."
1.0,"Oat Revolution and Oat Fit, not amazing","I've tried both the Oat Revolution and Oat Fit and compared to real oats, they don't compare. The only reason why I tried them was because of the 25 cent price, but it's not even worth that. I have to throw in raisins and cranberries just to eliminate the artificial flavors. I'm going to stick to my Old Fashioned Oats from now on. And if anyone on here eats as much Oatmeal as I do, you'll notice a difference."
5.0,Lasagne is back on my Can Eat foods. You Made Good!,I had complained that my noodles were broken but the second shipment came fine. I can now have lasagne! It didn't hurt my blood sugar and it was easy to work with. I will be buying more as I need. Thank you for being a Stand Up company. Most would not care. I'm very happy and will let my diabetic friends know about you. Thanks and many blessings!
1.0,Horrid!!!,"Do not order these ""noodles"" unless you think tentacles off a jellyfish picked up off the beach might be yummy!  That is what these fishy smelling, gelatinous, packed in liquid horrors are like!  Oh and they are ""nonreturnable!""  I threw them straight in the garbage!  What a waste of money!  Spare yourself."
1.0,I lost my plant,"The plant became to dry in the moment I put out of the box. I planted it in a new planter, placed inside my office close by a window and watered 3 times a week. Two days later it became to lost the leaves and had no one leaf more after two weeks. I sent an email to the seller and he said I should keep watering and it should come back. Never came back. The seller refund me with no questions, but I still sad because I would love to have a jabuticaba tree for personal reasons and now they don't sell it anymore."
5.0,Superb!,"Simply addictive, buttery, delicious soft chew, the explosion of sea salt--a perfect candy!  Great for gifts, to your loved ones or yourself."
5.0,Great cereal by Kashi!,"I recently ordered the 6-box pack from Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  No worries about this cereal sitting in the closet as I've gone through 2 boxes already!  The cereal is light and tasty, with just the right amount of cinnamon and sweetness for me.  Mind you, I like just a hint of sweetness in my cereal - so don't expect anything sugary sweet.  Intend to order more once Amazon has stock."
1.0,green mountain Blueberry K-cup,some of the cups were opened ...the box was crashed ...most of them were dented ..it was not the way i excepted to get them shipped...the box was a mess .. when i opened the box the coffee went all over the place
5.0,A Blast From the Past,"I remember these from my college days. I don't remember how I stumbled onto them on Amazon, but when I did, I bought a bag. They were just like I remembered them-annoyingly addicting! The more you eat, the better they are. They were soft and reasonably fresh, certainly better than in the store, if you can find them. Highly recommended, but not if you are on a diet."
1.0,not tasty,"I'm sorry to report that this coffee is just not tasty!!  It has a sour taste!!  Not sure if this is ""right"" but I really don't like it.  Also, it's really hard to use these pods in my Sense machine.  I usually use 2 pods in the larger basket to make a large mug of coffee.  2 pods are too big for the large basket, so I've had to use 1 pod in the smaller one, and make 2 small cups to equal my large mug.  Pain in the neck...  I'm really sorry I ended up with 3 BOXES of this stuff!!  At least they're individually packaged, so I can save them for ""coffee emergencies""."
5.0,Healthy substitute for Rawhide.,"We had decided not to give our dog rawhide, but he is an aggressive chewer and needed something to chew on.  I ordered the SmartBones hoping for a substitute for the Dingo Bones we had given our previous dog.  Bogie loves the SmartBonese, and they last quite a while, although not as long as a rawhide bone.  The fantastic part is they are made from vegetables and are easily digested.  We are dedicated SmartBone users.  I give them an A++++++++++++."
5.0,Best deal for the BEST coffee!,"Such a deal on my favorite coffee! The price was low, shipping fast and the coffee is great! The coffee was shipped in a sturdy box and arrived so quick. I love my Keurig and Emeril's Big Easy is so good and very tastey."
5.0,Yum!,"This coffee is delicious!  Not much of a coffee drinker, but received a Keurig machine from my parents and am now hooked."
5.0,Value for money,Must be the best organic coffee out there - tried a couple of their other blends but this is an all time favorite
5.0,Good sardines,"These come in individual metal boxes, each in its own cardboard box with nutritional information printed in readable sized print.  Sardines' flavor and texture are excellent, metal box pull-tab actually works.  I will order more of these."
5.0,LOVE THIS RICE,OMG - my favorite rice.  LOVE IT.  Just buy one and you will love it and be hooked.  It is spicy though.  My mother hates it but my 2 year old loves it.  So go figure.  And for the price from Amazon - you can't go wrong.  Cheaper than the grocery and delivered to your door!
5.0,LOVE it or HATE it,"I happen to fall into the ""love it"" category. These ginger chews are extremely addictive for those that love them. The first time I ate one, I wasn't really sure I liked it; it is extremely strong in ginger flavor, almost to the point of overpowering. However, I tried another...and then another...and then another...yup, they are addictive. My brother told me stop buying them for him because he ate so many they actually made his stomach hurt. So, in moderation, these little ginger chews (which are, like the name says, chewy!) are fantastic! The  health benefit also makes them  that much better, as ginger is known for helping relieve stomach aches as well as being good for arthritis. I really prefer these chews over crystallized ginger which is a little too sweet for me."
1.0,Don't waste your money!,"I was looking for a new cereal to enjoy, since Product 19 can't be found on grocery store shelves anymore.  I know Kellogg's is really pushing the ""Special K"" diet and all, but this is the worst tasting cereal I've ever had.  After I choked down most of the first bowl I immediately pitched the rest in the trash.  Thanks Amazon for making Product 19 available; wish I had thought to look here earlier before buying the Special K Protein Plus."
1.0,Price?,"I love Velveeta cheese as much as the next guy - great taste, versatility, same product for mega years, etc. etc.  That said, I also love online shopping and by that I mean shopping at Amazon.  When I need to buy something, I go to Amazon before I go anywhere else.  Those 2 things said, I really do not want to pay over $8.00 each for this cheese when I can get it at town for $5 practically everywhere I go.  I will not order from Amazon until they can actually become competitive with their price on Velveeta Cheese, 32 oz."
1.0,It tastes terrible!,"Don't buy it - it tastes terrible.  I am a big fan of coconut juice / water of any variety. I've had the plain ""Vita Coco"" before, and was quite happy with it. Since they had a deal on this flavored one, I figured I'd try it. Bad call. It tastes so bad, that I'm debating just tossing it all out. I've even had two friends try it, and neither one liked it - wondering if it went bad, or was meant to taste bad.  Moral of the story? If you want to try something new, don't buy a 12-pack."
5.0,SCRUMPTIOUS CANDY,"I purchased this candy twice already and will be buying alot more.  It is so delicious and all my friends loved it too.  The dark chocolate is very good as is all the rest of these ""cannot do without"" bear claws.  Some of the best I have ever tasted."
1.0,Way to pricey,Welchs Fruit Snacks were okay but way to expensive. I found a differnt brand with the same amount of indiviual bags for a 1/3 the price. I won't buy this item again.
5.0,My bedtime coffee,"Perfect for relaxing me after a long stressful day. Works better than hot chocolate, or a drink, for me. It is becoming harder to find though, because folks seem to be using it in the sugar-free blend instead of exercising."
1.0,"Doesn't taste like bacon, isn't very good","These croutons don't taste at all like bacon, and should not be allowed to be advertised as such.  They taste like really crappy BBQ.  The quantity is fine and they are an OK deal, so I'm not sure I'll follow up on a return, but they do not taste very good, and definitely not at all like bacon.  Don't bother."
1.0,Not good at all,I thought it was great that there was hot cocoa for the keurig machine.  this is so watery when you make it.  green mountain needs to improve it.  it tastes like chocolate flavored water.  if you make a product that is intended for the machine it should work well in the machine.  i love all of the k-cup coffees but this cocoa sucks.
5.0,Texture very similar to sugar,"I use erythritol for low carb baking on a regular basis. It is the only sugar alcohol I've used, but I've read that it causes less gastrointestinal trouble that some of the others. I generally replace some sugar indicated in a recipe with granular splenda and some with erythritol. The combination works well."
1.0,Awful taste,These dried mango chunks do not look or taste like mango. The chunks are a very light yellow color. They are sort of crystalized as if they had been processed with sugar; would probably work well in a fruitcake.
1.0,Candy meltdown,Charleston Vanilla Chew must have been subjected to very high heat as each bar opened so far had the inner part melted and partially leaked to the outside of the chocolate.  To make things worse the melted inner part has welded itself to the cardboard wrapper and cannot be totally removed.  You therefore are eating cardboard with the candy. It is not warm outside so I would be very surprised if the trucking company who delivered it was at fault.
5.0,Great for the money and tastes good,"Tastes good like a real wafer cookie.  Cheap for what you get, too.  This one's a keeper, and I have bought it many times over."
5.0,Most Delicious Apple Chips Made by Seneca,16 dollar for a 12 pack of these chips is a steal =D!!!! These chips are freaking delicious if you want something sweet to snack on.
5.0,strong enough for 2 cups,"This stuff is strong and dark, it's prefect for double pump to fill that 18-20oz to-go cup. After cream and sweetener, it tastes just like a cup of Timothy's Colombian Dorado (Which I love), except you get X2 the amount."
5.0,Great Coffee Treat,"It's the best beverage of its type that we're ever enjoyed.  Maxwell House should be proud of the product.  The delivery by Amazon was on time, as usual.  Keep up the good work !"
1.0,I haven't eaten these cookies...,"..and I won't because cookies aren't paleo! Snacking isn't really paleo, and processed food is most definitely not paleo! This is a gluten-free cookie, a processed factory food. If you have celiac, I'd guess these are your best cookie option, but cookies are not healthy natural food. People! Seriously!"
5.0,Great tasting smooth coffee,"I love this coffee! It's got a great smooth flavor, not bitter at all and not too strong. Perfect for those who like a nice breakfast blend!"
5.0,Don't believe the hype,"I used to hear how coconut oil is so unhealthy for you.  But thank God for the internet and objective researchers.  Perhaps if a coconut oil has been refined and adulterated and hydrogenated it will be unhealthy, but raw, virgin coconut oil is one of the best things in the world for you.  I use this product not only in my diet but for skin and health care as well.  Think about it, how could a fruit that grows from the earth for our benefit be unhealthy?  This Nutiva product is a godsend and I will make sure to keep a steady stock of it from now on.  Just check out the several books out there touting the benefits of virgin coconut oil and you'll see what I mean."
5.0,favorite k-cup,Newman's own K-cups are the best i have tasted in about a year and a half of owning a Keurig. They brew strong but not bitter and don't  have the plastic/chemical taste of some k-cup blends. Great product.
5.0,Great product,I have to keep my intake of fat at a minimum. This cake is just the ticket for me to enjoy a cake without fat. Very easy to fix and bake. I am a Guy and not a genius in the kitchen but even I can fix this cake.
1.0,"Great drink, awful price","I love this drink, but be warned, the price here ($53) is nearly double that of a regular grocery store in the US ($30). Sometimes they're on sale for even less."
1.0,I Love Lemon,"I love lemon and poppyseed, but this cookie is horrible.  It tastes really horrible.  I couldn't get past a few bites.  Something about the taste, the texture.  It was all bad.  I feel really bad giving low ratings.  I take pleasure in giving good ratings.  But I being honest."
5.0,One of the favorites,My daughter loves this one. If she has a day when she doesn't want to eat anything. I know that she will always eat the apple butternut squash and the sweet potato with cinnamon.
1.0,Tastes like chemicals,I purchased two types of stevia to try to move from using artificial sweetener to stevia. I read recommendations for this product so I decided we would try it. This really has a strong aftertaste of alcohol and chemicals. (I was disappointed because we had two bottles of the stuff. My bad.) I threw it out because no one would eat the food that it touched.  FYI - I prefer the Stevita Stevia Supreme because there is no aftertaste with it.  I wish it was in liquid form too because that would be helpful.
5.0,Best-tasting powdered drink,"I go through a 20-count box in a week or so, that is how good this stuff tastes. It quenches my thirst and is delicious ice-cold. AND...a great buy through Amazon when compared to the ridiculous high price at the local supermarket IF they even carry it!"
5.0,As GREAT and the other 5 star ones!!!!,"It doesn't lose to ""Zico"" or the other one that I also gave 5 stars! Great taste!!!! And cheaper than Zico!"
5.0,"Amazing, Incredible and Delish","I absolutely love Arctic Zero.  All the flavors are amazing.  Chocolate, Vanilla, and Chocolate Peanut Butter are faves but now I need to add to that list the Pumpkin Spice.  This one is right on with a perfect blend of pumpkin spice!  The Arctic Zero customer service is the best I have seen.  You have to try this stuff!!!"
5.0,Good stuff,This coffee smells better than it tastes but it still is an awesome product!  Reminds you of the Christmas holiday.  I highly recommend it!
1.0,Seven days of bad taste in your mouth,"The ghastly horror of these pickles is enough to strip the mind of reason.  They are brown, mushy, and flavored with spices that bring to mind the morgue and the taxidermist.  On top of that each and every pickled chunk is sweetened with a full tablespoon of pure cane sugar.  No living human being could consume more than one without selling his immortal soul."
1.0,Poor product,"I wanted to try these out because of the price and because it seemed to have solid reviews. I really like Slim Jims, and this looked similar and had good reviews.  I didn't notice any mushiness that some people claimed. I thought it had a good snap to it, although you can definitely see where the casing is and the rest of the product, and sometimes it will just slide out a bit.  I like the packaging. You can stick these into a big slider ziplock bag and it makes it far more convenient than any individually wrapped product, like Slim Jims are. I don't know how well it will keep that way, but I think it should be fine because, well, these products are pretty much designed to be kept like that. I don't know why some companies individually wrap theirs, maybe someone else can chime in on that.  And now for the negative. Originally I tried to be more diplomatic with it, because I didn't want to dock stars for it not tasting like a Slim Jim. My brother absolutely hated the sticks and considers them disgusting. I held out that they weren't that bad, but after forcing myself to eat them the last few days I now give up.  But worse is the ingredients. These things pack MSG. There is no nutritional label so we don't even know the percentage of it. But it is listed as an ingredient. Now it depends on you if that is a problem or not, for me personally I want to avoid MSG so this product doesn't work for me.  I will likely throw away the rest of what I have. It is better to go for regular jerky, which can actually be healthy. These sticks are however a different product that you have to look at carefully, and for me the taste just isn't good enough to justify eating them."
5.0,Pet friendly,"This product was recommended to me to try.  Since my dog had bad allergy symptoms.  So far so good.  The skin has cleared up, no problem with the transition to a new food.  Loved it from the first bite. Delivery was very fast and efficient."
5.0,"Tried and true, traditional wisdom for you","The cough suppressant in this product is from menthol (10 mg per cup), which adds a noticeable, cooling medicinal taste to this tea; yet, the taste of this tea is so spicy and aromatic that it isn't ""medicinal""...like a cough drop.  I've enjoyed this lots of times without cold symptoms.  The aroma is healing too, so it's a tea that you inhale the steam from and feel the clearing of nasal passage.  This formula for cough relief is genuinely ""traditional"" as the brand name says, and comes from a European (Swiss) recipe/manufactured in Germany, and has a fascinating history described on the box.  It's my opinion this tea is tasty without anything added.  Recommended.  FYI on the other ingredients, making for the great taste, but ineffective to your cough: meadowsweet flower, wild thyme, licorice root, plantain leaf, Echinacea, elder flower, oil of peppermint."
5.0,Thank God for this tea!,"I don't even know where to begin to express my relief in finding this tea! I've been determined to exclusively breastfeed my daughter since she was born and was doing so with no problem until I got mastitis. 2 weeks of antibiotics and pumping & dumping took a toll on my supply, especially when my daughter got used to the bottle. At three months my supply went down to about 14oz total all day. I had to start supplementing which I hated and was almost in tears for a week as I watched my supply get lower and lower. i was told about this tea by a nutritionist and it's been a Godsend! My milk is up to almost twice as much from just having one or two cups a day. I'll admit that i'm not crazy about the flavor. Tastes like black licorice which I hate, but it's definitely drinkable. I just drink it cold with lemon and sugar and hold my breath. I'm a believer now and would recommend it to anyone!"
5.0,Good stuff!,"By far the best tasting EFA product I've tried. I use it straight, in salads and uncooked sauces and as an additive in my massage oil. It absorbs cleanly into the skin and leaves a silky texture. Good price too. Love it!"
5.0,A tasty tea,"This is a delicious tea. Please try it, at least once.  I did, and will be drinking htis tea during the winter months when I prefer hot liquids. A single box contains 16 biodegradable tea bags containing a full-leaf tea ""blend"" of fermented broad-leaf wild tea leaves called: PUERH.  It is a rich flavorful taste with a wonderful aroma of flowery vanillas and earthly notes to hints of fruit. Oh,and the color of the tea is red.  Enjoy!"
5.0,French Vanilla,"I love International Delight French Vanilla, lots better than Coffee Mate brand. I will only purchase International Delight Creamer. It works great when I travel except on an airplane."
5.0,A modern day fairy tale,"A twist of rumplestiskin captured on film, starring michael keaton and geena davis in their prime.  Tim Burton's masterpiece, rumbles with absurdity, and is wonderfully paced to the point where there is not a dull  moment."
1.0,This is just wrong...,"My son doesn't like peas.  I've tried feeding him the Gerber Organic peas and he dodges the spoon.  So since all of sprouts food is good, I thought - hey, I'm sure Tyler Florence's peas are better than Gerber.  Boy was I wrong!  It started when I first opened the bag - it smells absolutely horrible and the color is a yucky brownish green.  So I warmed it up and sampled it before giving to my son.  OMG, I almost had to wipe it off of my tounge.  It is really really bad, and that is about the kindest thing I can say about this pea/greenbean/mint mix.  I tried to give it to my son and his reaction was as bad as mine.  I just coulnd't force feed him somethign I couldn't stomach myself.  So far all other Sprout flavors are 5 stars, but leave this one on the shelf - - - it is BAD!"
1.0,Skip it!,"I was excited to try this coffee; a low-acid organic whole bean in my favorite roast. I was very disappointed; beans were dull with lots of broken pieces and it smelled awful. Taste was even worse than the appearance, very stale with an almost chemical overtone. I threw away $40 worth of coffee beans because no one here would drink it. Thank goodness amazon.com took care of me, their customer service was great as usual."
1.0,again flat and plain,"I thought french roast would give me more flavor and smell, same thing, nothing special about this coffee, when opens up, it is flat and plain, no lust and didnt smell much, seems like it's been in the shelf for a long time. Price is good, that's the only good about it, otherwise it is just so-so."
1.0,"Not ""virtually indestructible""","Packaging claims this is ""virtually indestructible."" Our 15lb Labradoodle had shredded the plastic that held the treat in on this in just a couple of hours. Waste of money."
5.0,Excellent for Pressure Fried Chicken,"I have been looking for a good batter mix for my pressure fryer and found it!!  I used to buy the mix from Pro-Selections, but it was expensive.  4 bags for $30!  It was good but I noticed it said it was mixed for them.  After looking around it appears that Drakes probably makes it for them.  I bought this blindly as I never heard about it before.  After some googling, I found that this is a pretty popular brand back east.  I tried it out this past weekend and it is pretty much the same as the Pro-Selections mix but at a much better price!  I will try to use it with some other foods, but my primary use is for Pressure Fried Chicken!"
1.0,Bad Cheese,The cheese was old and hard tried to slice and just broke off in chunks . Bought a 2lb and it wass great wont buy again.
1.0,Huge price increase,Loved it til I saw the recent price increase.  Subscription price goes from $16 to $30.  Are you kidding me? I'm outta here.
1.0,Disappointed,"I have ordered this product in the past and been quite pleased with the quality; since we are dairy-free, I use a lot of coconut milk.  However, my most recent order has revealed that this coconut milk is not what it used to be.  It is watery, the coconut cream portion is hard and can't be whisked into the milk like it should be.  There is NO way you could use this coconut cream portion - it is anything but creamy.  I am so disappointed, and now I'm stuck with a whole case with limited useability and have wasted my money.  I just canceled my subscription to this item; I will not be ordering it ever again!"
1.0,Not happy!,"I had such great hopes for this Bundt cake mix - I am grateful that I was testing it prior to serving it for a special occasion.  The ""caramel sauce packet"" consists of caramel pellets that I imagine are supposed to melt during the baking process - but only a portion melted - and the top of my Bundt cake looks like the surface of the moon!!!  My finished cake has huge holes in the top from where the little pellets didn't melt - and, upon removing the cake from the pan, the unmelted pellets (or chips or whatever) stuck to the pan like glue.  I followed this recipe to the letter and I am a great baker so I am sure that the product was old (although the freshness date states that it is fresh until May 2011) or it was ruined somehow on the shelf or in transit.  Considering that my investment in this cake is 3 eggs, a cup of whole milk and one and a half sticks of butter - plus my initial purchase cost - plus my time and energy - I am truly not happy.  And of course have no way to return this item.  Arghh."
1.0,Double Yuck,"I have had great organic chocolate.  This is not great organic chocolate.  It is not even good or even fair organic chocolate.  It is extremely poor.  The chocolate was chalky, not at all smooth.  The flavor was absolutely horrendous!!  A expected a hint of ginger and chai.  The bar was so overpowered by the ""hint"" of flavors that it completely washed out any of the chocolate flavor.  I was so surprised by the nastiness of the bar.  (I refuse to call it chocolate), that I spit it out.  Then I threw out this $2.75 bar of yuck."
5.0,"Taste great, and they make perfect treats for dogs too.","I like the full size Cow Tales (why aren't they called cow TAILS? Cows don't tell tales, they have tails...) and ordered this 3 pound package of smaller size candies. They're slightly chewy, with a creamy type inside filling, and come in other flavors too. They lasted a bit longer since I was eating less per portion, but the dogs just loved them. They would see me starting to peel the wrappers, and almost instantly get into sitting position without me saying a word. There's no chocolate, raisins or other ingredients that would be bad for them, and I limit the total amount too. Don't want diabetic dogs, just happy ones.   The price was reasonable for the amount I got. It was shipped quickly and tasted fresh. I'll be buying more soon."
5.0,Best Christmas dinner ever,"The flavor, aroma, and applewood smoked taste was extraordinary.  The pheasant was moist and tender.  I hope they bring it back for the holidays in 2010 as we'd like to make it a family tradition."
1.0,bottarga di muggine,"The quality of this product is very bad - it is very very dry and it looks like it is too old already. I understand that it is genuine and original and really comes from Sardegna, however the Bottarga product, that I usually buy there is much better tasting and a way better looking."
5.0,My dog knows these by name and RUNS for the treat jar,"I've named these ""chicken balls"" and my Puggle is fully aware of what I mean when I utter those words. She RUNS to her treat jar and pokes at it with her nose with reckless impatience as I hurry along behind her. I love that they're simple with no additives, just dehydrated chicken and rice. They smell just like chicken and rice if you put them right up to your nose. So they're inoffensive for those with sensitive noses. They're bite size and super crunchy. These may be too large or too hard for Shih Tzu and smaller dogs. I say this because when I babysit an adult Shih Tzu, she attempts to eat it but can't. I've broken them into smaller pieces for her and she'll eat them. These do not stain the teeth like those other chewy treats with color additives. They're safe to keep at room temperature and they keep for a very long time since they're dehydrated, although they never last more than a couple of weeks in my house!  I highly recommend them."
5.0,Freed Me From Soda,"I tried out Steaz on the recommendation of a friend after a recent doctor visit. I had been drinking too much soda, and i'm past the point of not paying attention to things like that. I was looking for a healthier alternative, something that had more flavor than water but wouldn't be burying my system in sugar. The half and half was a combo I guessed I'd like, since I like the Arizona Arnold Palmer drink. I'm happy to report these are pretty tasty. The flavoring is on the light side, but for me it's a good compromise that gets me off the soda sugar but avoids the monotony of only drinking water during the day."
5.0,Nice and thick,"I used to purchase Earth's Best and Plum Organics brand prunes until they were both unavailable one day.  I ordered these O Organics prunes instead to try them out.  They are fantastic!  I'm a convert.  These are much thicker in texture than the other prunes, so it's like getting more prunes for the volume.  My baby loves these."
1.0,nutri vet dog biscuits - 20 pound box,"I am very disappointed in Amazon with this purchase.  Although I purchased a 20 pound box, I only received 18 pounds?  Even the shipper listed the weight at 18 pounds.  Is Amazon now into false advertising?"
1.0,Where's the Shea?,I love the Shea Moisture products so I saw this labeled Shea hair oil and said why not give it a try.  Unfortunately the first ingredient listed in this is Mineral Oil which I'm sure most people know is not good for your hair. Suffice to say that I didn't bother trying it.  Shame on you for labeling this the way you did. Why not call it Ultra Mineral Oil...
1.0,Mushy,"These Anchovies are terrible. They are mushy. More like a paste than a filet. We threw the 2nd can away, had them too long to return them to Amazon."
1.0,Horrible smell of this product,"The rice was shipped in a burlap bag as I expected.  Inside the burlap bag the rice was inside a plastic bag.  However, the plastic bag was partially opened and the entire bag of rice smelled horrible from the burlap or the paint on the burlap. Perhaps this opening was from the way the filled the plastic bag but they made no effort to completely seal the plastic before putting it into the burlap.  I tried this rice anyway and the finished rice also tasted of something still picking up the burlap smell.  DO NOT BUY THIS RICE.  If there was a zero rating I would have given it that, one star is too much.  Update 4.23.2012:  Contacted the seller and they are allowing me to return this item and fully refund my costs along with providing prepaid shipping back to them.  Can't ask any better of a vendor, they are top rate."
5.0,Fresh,The annatto delivered to me was fresh. Annatto that is old has a dull rusty brown color but this annatto was a fresh deep red. Very pleased with the product.
1.0,I Ting I will NOT buy these Tings again!,"I was disappointed with the flavor of these. I really love the taste of nutritional yeast (I'm a vegan) but the only discernable flavor of these doodles was salt. I don't know why nutritional yeast is listed as one of the ingredients and the flavor non-existent. I think it may have been a marketing ploy to entice ""health nuts"" and vegans to buy them. It's too bad since nutritional yeast is so full of nutrients and flavor. If you are a vegan, don't waste your money!! Go makes some popcorn and sprinkle some nutrional yeast over it.... it's much less expensive and healthier than these lousy things, I mean ""Tings""."
1.0,Poor packaging of sausage,"We have purchased this item several times in the past and it was always shipped in insulated boxes and delivered over night from a company called Christmas Central on the East Coast. We ordered this time again expecting the same efficiency. The shipment of four pounds of Polish Sausage came in three separate cartons-none of them insulated, the ""frozen"" gel-packs (all of three of them) were melted and warm to the touch and even the sausage itself did not feet cold to the touch. It was  delivered to its destination by the regular post man who stuffed the sausage along with daily meal into the mail box. Your West Coast provider Otto's Imports,  simply said that they had done everything they could do short of delivering the sausage in person. They are obviously ill prepared for this type of deliveries. We still haven't decided whether to chance eating this sausage or simply throwing it away."
1.0,Too little for too much !,"I ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy.  There is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound.  Each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good.  You are probably used to Jelly Bellies, but these are not Jelly Bellies.  There flavor is medium at best.  I would not buy this product again."
5.0,A night at the movies,If you want to have the movie theater experience at home then Paragon Coconut popping oil is the way to go!
5.0,Really good chocolate flavor,"I ordered this syrup to try an egg cream. Excellent! Then I tried it to make plain chocolate milk. Also excellent! Since I live in northern Minnesota, and hot chocolate can be a year round drink, I tried it to make hot chocolate. Superb! The next step is to try it in coffee for cafe mocha. I'm also not ashamed to admit it tastes good directly from a spoon."
1.0,Salty,"This product (Noodle soup) has too much salt in it.  Let's ssee more ""lower salt"" items. Thanks. Jim S."
5.0,wonderfully soothing tea...,"I love Tazo teas, so when I found this new variety I was excited to try it.  It doesn't  disappoint !  This is a delicious blend of soothing herbs .  It relaxes you  and makes you ready for sleep!  I recommend it to all !"
5.0,LavAzza Espresso delicious,"I make this coffee in a moka pot.  It is so smooth and delicious.  I highly recommend it as it is just as good as what you would get at a high priced java joint, and only takes 6 minutes to brew.  I warm up about 1/4 cup 2% milk in the microwave and it makes just the right amount to fill an average sized insulated cup.  Out the door I go and loving the smooth rich taste - gets my morning off to a perfect start."
5.0,review,"The kong stuff'n cookies arrived very fast, ahead of expected arrival date. Packaging was great, none of the cookies are broken and my dogs love these treats!!"
5.0,Fast shipment / awesome product,"Got this shipment lightning fast. 100 of these should keep my son happy for a while. Cant beat the price. These are the little snack size, but there are so many of them. Perfect size to cram in my purse or my little boy's backpack. I will purchase again."
1.0,4 boxes of 100% damaged products.,"I ordered these products through prime, and they appeared to be packaged properly.  Every single bag was damaged in the manufacturing process, and I was unable to use any of the products. It appears the products were not checked before sending, and there was a slit down the side of every single bag.  All 4 boxes appeared to come from the same production batch.  To top it off I cannot return the products.  So now I am out $19 dollars, and I cannot use BioBag's compost bin which I also bought.  Can't say everyone will get the same bags, but buyer beware.  I have pictures, but I cannot upload them in this review."
5.0,Not wings...rockets!,Love the energy...perfect for working out. Not a fan of the carbonated flavors but the non-carbonated all rock. This stuff is amazing--my wife and I are hooked on it!
5.0,Very excited to have found this on Amazon!,"Never been to cincinnati, but love this product.  We had a local store that was carring this in Washington state.  But they stopped. :(  now we can order it on amazon.  People are complaining because it's not like normal chili...  It is it's own new type of food.  Don't compair it to regular chili, try it on it's own.  Enjoy."
5.0,"Tasty, great value, really worth a try!","We used these for quick-n-easy dinners, lunches and talk about HEALTHY!  WOW!  Perfect tossed in a skillet with some plain white rice and veggies.  No sauce needed - this tuna is SUPER flavorful!  I would definately buy this again!"
5.0,Good stuff,"It's not easy finding good fish stock.  If I want really good stock, strong fish stock, I make it myself.  Can't always do that though.  I've gone through a few cases of this product and have been happy with the results every time I've used it.  Unlike other fish stock that is primarily vegetable broth (e.g., Kitchen Basics Seafood Stock), this product is represented to be, and tastes like, 100% fish stock.  They do uses spices (onion, celery, dry white wine, lemon, bay leaves, salt, whole peppercorns, parsley).  It tastes good but I don't really notice any of the spices.  So the use of spices seems to be minimal, which for me is good.  I like to add my own spices.  They claim the product has all-natural ingredients, which I also like.  Anyway, I recommend this product."
1.0,Funky taste to these buggers,"Thought I give the dried Cherry and Blueberry a try after really enjoying the dried Cranberries. I'm just not impressed with taste or consistency of the blueberry.  Not a product I would buy again.  Feel the same way about the dried cherries, as well. The taste of the dried cherries is disagreeable to my taste buds...almost fishy."
5.0,Fantastic Drink,"I was very surprised to see that there are negative reviews for this drink.  My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by how amazing this soda is!  As far as orange sodas go, I don't see how you can do much better.  We definitely didn't notice any kind of weird aftertaste.  Also the price on here (don't forget the shipping) is ridiculous.  See if your local Walmart stocks this, because ours does and it was only about 5 bucks."
1.0,Wrecked by Coconut Shortage,I'm changing this review from 5 stars to 1 star. This product used to be creamy and flavorful. The last two cases I've received have gone down the drain. The coconut milk is now dull and watery/oily. It's disgusting.
5.0,diamond review,Diamond walnuts are superior in quality.  Best walnuts in USA.  convenient setup to have delivered regularly.
5.0,Dog chews,My Yorky loves them. I buy the big ones(they have different sizes to choose from tho) and it gives her hours and hours of chew time. Great for her teeth.
1.0,Expired dog food,"I normally love amazon, but I also received expired dog food. Ordered it late November, and the bag expired 9/10!  An oversight I'm sure, but very disappointing."
1.0,Almost good,the banana tastes like dirt. everything else is pretty good. most def don't eat the bananas.they should just replace the banana with mango or some other fruit.
1.0,"Don't forget to add Imodium AD to your order - YOU""LL NEED IT!!","UGH!  A handful of these and an hour or two later, you'll be in the bathroom every 15 minutes.  I couldn't stop until I took the Imodium.  Not a good thing..."
1.0,"Disgusting Artificial Sweeteners in All Sodastream, even non-diet",I squinted on the product picture and made out that sugar was the first ingredient as one would hope in a non-diet drink flavoring. Imagine my frustration when I discovered Splenda and acesulfame potassium among other chemicals I choose not to ingest! Why offer a diet version and non-diet version if everything has nasty artificial sweeteners?
5.0,Calbee Snapea Crisps...5 Stars,Snapea Crisps taste so good. I ordered a second case. The whole family likes them. 5 Stars
1.0,Disapointed,"If you like strong coffee, as I do this coffee is over rated. I found it weak, with a sickening after  taste."
1.0,Mystery Fluid,Received a flat of this product on a subscription. I was hoping to save money by buying in bulk and was looking forward to the  convenience of having the product shipped on a scheduled basis.  The very first carton I opened contained a thick and lumpy fluid. It did not smell bad or have a distinct taste - it just was not what I expected to come out of a carton that should have contained soy milk. Yes I did shake the carton well before opening it.  The second carton was fine.  The bottom line is that the loss of one carton from the flat eliminates the whole value proposition of buying in bulk and on-line. I would avoid this brand.  Update: Score so far for the pack of 12: 3 bad 8 good. One more to go!
1.0,old stale coffee,"avoid it, this is old stale coffee. I gave it a try because it was low price at the time, I guess i know where old coffee goes now."
1.0,Snow's crappy chowder,"We were so disappointed.  I haven't been able to find Snow's Clam Chowder in my local stores for about 2 years so I was so excited to find it available here.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews.  This is NOT SNOW'S CLAM CHOWDER.  This is some garbage that Bumble Bee has decided to market using the Snow's name.  Now I have 10 cans left from this case that will probably be fed to my neighbor's pigs because we certainly won't be eating the rest of this.  What a waste."
5.0,fart bombs,These bombs are hilarious!!  We've had a ball with the family--setting them off and waiting for a response but they sure are stinky!!  Run for the hills!
5.0,delicious,"Excellent, truly delicious ....very fresh tasting as well. I will only buy this brand of sauce now.  Give it a try, you'll love it"
5.0,Best Ever Peanut Butter,"Purchased Dark Chocolate Dreams after searching ""dark chocolate"" and reading the reviews for this peanut butter.  I dip my spoon in the jar and eat as is - best, most satisfying snack I could wish for.  I've never had it on bread, seems too odd, but might try it someday."
1.0,Cost too high,$38 devided by 5 pounds is over $7 a pound of candy. Are you serious? These Sunkist candies can be found at any grocery store that has a bulk asile. I just bout a pound for $2.97 a pound. Had I bought 5 pounds I would have spent $14.85. So why would you pay close to $40 on Amazon? Crazy to me.
1.0,Hype.,"After reading the ingredients, I was not happy. I expected truly healthy ingredients, as with Newman's Own products. It's been a while, so I can't recall exactly what led me to believe the contents of the bag were not much better than most other commercial pet food. If I believed it were a healthier option for my 6 cats, I would have continued to spend the 35 bucks a bag. By-product, meal, and added vitamins turn me off. I will continue to feed my cats IAMS (which is not really better, in my opinion, just 13 bucks less expensive) because they always want food available to them as I search for a reasonably priced and truly healthy food. I only feed my dog Newman's Own treats and food that I prepare myself. Sorry BB, I'll pass forever."
1.0,Price is bad,19.99 for 12 k-cups is more than double what you will pay even at the most expensive gourmet store.  You can get this very box of coffee at any neighborhood grocery for 8 dollars.  The coffee is great... but this item's price is way off base.
5.0,Yumm to the max,"It arrived packed nice, the price was a little high, but I am stuck on Lalah's as my curry favorite."
5.0,Pure Evil in a Jar,"The title says it all. I love the creamy goodness of this spread. Once I start eating it, it's hard to stop. Try it with Nutella. You can also find this cheaper at places like Central Market. I paid WAY less than they are asking here."
5.0,"Tasty with a nice Crunch!  August 17, 2009","I had tried this product before, many years ago. When I saw it here on Amazon, I remembered how good it was. Old London Melba toast is a great healthy snack. I love to eat it with tuna or soup. Low in calories and salt, it is a great way to stay trim around the middle! I am so glad you carry this product. I love melba toast,and now that I have to lower my sodium intake this is the perfect product."
1.0,Mackintosh Creamy Toffee,"Sorry candy, it tastes old and its a long way from Creamy and the shipping cost will blow you away. If you have ever had Mackintosh Toffee in the bar don't expect the same great candy in the indivdually wrapped pieces that come in the bags. I would never buy it again."
5.0,"Easy, Healthy Snack",My daughter has loved these since she started with finger foods at about 8.5 months. They are great for 'on the go' and keep her occupied (as well as a nourished snack!). She is breastfed but had yogurt already so I knew she didn't have a milk allergy. Less sugar then Gerber!
5.0,The very best,If you are interested in the very best chocolate liquers and feel you deserve only the finest by all means purchase Anthon Berg original spirits encased in the finest chocolate only a world reknown expert could produce. Only a value such as this could be purchased and guaranteed by Amazon.
5.0,SEE MY OTHER REVIEW,"I GOT THIS REVIEW MIXED UP WITH THE OTHER COFFEE A REG. COFFEE, I BOUGHT FROM THE SAME MAKER, I LIKE IT OR I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT MORE OF THE SAME BRAND."
5.0,Always the best!!,I have bought lavender from this seller and just the same it seems so fresh and I am loving it!! I will continue to be a customer of Catey!  Thank you ~
1.0,"These are GRAPE tootsie pops, not red raspberry","Tootsie roll pops are great to have around or to send as a gift - but BEWARE - read the ""small print"".  These are GRAPE!!"
5.0,Tea-toter,"What a wonderful deep rich flavor !  Never really being a tea drinker, I started having cups of tea when I started having headaches....I lost my taste for coffee. This was my first attempt at drinking different flavors of loose tea since store shelf bagged tea was nothing special......it opened a new world of healthy , delicious , flavorful drinking.  The Cinnamon Plum is absolutely bursting with scent and flavor and has become my favorite. A friend gave me a tea brewer for Christmas and I now have an assortment of Rishi teas...all of which have a special way of being brewed. Besides being healthy , tasting different teas has become an interesting past time."
1.0,Ripoff - beware of this exaggerated product,"I've bought their 20% Kona and 80% Tropical blend pods before and really enjoyed the taste.  I bought these because it appeared they were the same.  The box even looked the same.  Indeed, it stated on the box that it was a 20%-80% blend.  Inside, however, the pods are actually 10% Kona and 90% Tropical blend.  You can't even taste or smell the Kona coffee.  This is a bait and switch item that everyone should ignore."
5.0,Best Flavor,This is a great product for a great price.  Can no longer find it at costco so we figured why change to one we did not like as much.
5.0,Unbelievably Potent :),"Recently, after speaking with the owner of a local Chinese restaurant, I inquired about their outrageously HOT mustard served only upon request.  I was curious to find out if and where I could purchase this condiment to enjoy at home.  The owner explained that the mustard was prepared daily from a powder simply mixed with water to the desired consistency.  Having been repeatedly disappointed with the mainstream bottled grocery varieties labelled as ""hot"", a little online research certainly paid off! This ISN'T that lame packet mustard you commonly find in the bottom of your take out bag.  S&B oriental mustard ROCKS!  PROS:  * Nice 3oz quantity for personal home use for dipping, sauces, etc. [A little will go a very long way] * Sturdy and airtight canister for storage * ""Scald Your Sinuses Hot"" [Assuming you enjoy this trait--sure hope you do] * Flexibility to freshly prepare only the amount needed at a given time--prepared mustard will lose potency/heat if stored over time.  CONS:  * Powder should be handled with care--seriously potent and cannot imagine getting powder directly into eyes, cuts, etc. Children and novices beware!  Would certainly recommend to any and all of those folks [you know who you are] like myself who derive pleasure from a truly HOT mustard for dipping, egg rolls, spicy Chex mix, and other creative recipe ideas. CANNOT BEAT IT! :)"
5.0,SIMPLY GREAT,"THESE BEANS ARE SIMPLY GREAT.  YOU CAN UTILIZE THEM IN MANY WAYS. While dry beans are general soaked for two to four hours prior to cooking, Anasazi beans yield better results when soaked overnight or for at least eight hours. Known to cook much faster than ordinary pinto beans, Anasazi beans are often used to replace pinto beans in a variety of dishes including chili, soup and popular Latin dishes such as chalupas and nachos, or add mopre water and have bean soup.  My favorite is to cook them with a package of Liption Beef Onion Soup.  Wash them through three washings of water, then cover with two or three inches of water and let them soak overnight.  Drain, cover with water, add seasonings of choice, bring them to a boil, reduce the heat and let them simmer ONE HOUR.  They cook faster than most beans and are very tender at this one hour time.  Benefits: (according to a web site) In addition to being a good source of fiber, Anasazi beans are also an excellent source of potassium, folic acid and iron. While dry beans are known to contain certain carbohydrates that cause flatulence, the Anasazi bean has been found to contain less than 25 percent of these complex carbohydrates, making them much easier on the digestive system."
5.0,Excellent Low Carb Bread,"This bread is excellent. I love the taste and texture of this bread. It is a very dense bread but I like that. I went from 100% whole wheat to double fiber whole wheat and finally to this bread. And I found that I liked each one better than the last. If your preference is white bread you probably won't like this bread. But if you like real, hearty whole grain breads you will love this bread. I would eat this bread even if it weren't for the low-carb factor. I prefer it to regular bread and it's a lot healthier, even if you don't need a low-carb bread."
5.0,She's such a cutie!,"This baby is exceptionally cute for the 2003-2007 series.  She still has the magnet in her foot, so don't play with her on your hard drive =)  The hat is so cute too!  You can keep the plastic thing under the hat if you like.  I think it helps preserve the shape of the hat, but really, it's just part of the packaging.  I gave her a high educational value because somebody who owns this toy will probably be a My Little Pony fan, which teaches the value of friendship and cooperation, which I think is among the most important of things to learn early in life."
1.0,they stink,Was extremely disappointed. They smelled so bad (rather fishy) and felt like chewing rubber. Was unable to eat them and had to throw them away.
1.0,Not quite what you think,"Dried strawberries are smaller than most - and as another reviewer mentioned - sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.  For a product that costs about $.90 an ounce, you would think that Stoneridge could've ponied up the extra $.02 per ounce for real sugar.  In addition, they include propylene glycol (a less-toxic version of ethylene glycol, both used as antifreeze) to stop the berries from sticking to each other.  OK.... the effect of this is that they come across as ""slippery"" in your mouth, and not in a good way.  Strange part is, the ingredient list on the package that I typed this from is different than the ingredient list of the product as listed on the Stoneridge website. Their website mentioned that they are sweetened with sucrose, for example.  But the Stoneridge product we received from Amazon has HFCS.  And antifreeze.  The disclaimer above says it all - ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website.""  We won't be repeat customers."
5.0,low sugar all ages snack!,"My family loves these!  Although the package states 7+months (my nephew who is 9 months loves them too) my children 4,6,and 7 all love these.  I love that they are organic, gluten free, low sugar and taste delicious.  I keep these in the car for busy days and always find myself and my husband snacking on these.  They are a great school snack at the preschool and are perfect for the older kids lunch boxes."
5.0,Best I have found so far,"This cappuccino mix is the best, most coffee shop like that I have found.  With a teaspoon of my favorite sweetener, this mix makes a good cappuccino.  With an extra espresso capsule, it makes a great cappuccino that keeps me out of the expensive coffee houses.  My husband complains about the constant cost of the capsules, but it still beats starbucks and I can control the sweetness.  Love Amazon's speedy delivery!"
1.0,Man mauled by pack of wolves...,"I am writing this review from the hospital... A couple of weeks ago I ordered the ""Whole Rabbit"" from Amazon in hopes of having my wife cook it up nice and good.  The problem started when I opened the box. Of course I had been wearing my 3 Wolf Moon T-shirt for about 3 weeks (Still had another week before it needed to be washed) and the pack was hungry. They proceeded to claw and bite at the Whole Rabbit. I was an innocent bystander as the wolves mauled at my own torso trying to get to that waskally wabbit torso I held in my hands.  There was no way I wanted to give it up as my wife has a great recipe she found on Amazon. The ingredients, to name a few, are; Tuscan Milk (naturally), Uranium Ore, and Twinkies. Anyways, the Whole Rabbit never got cooked, I ended up with scars about the head, neck, chest, back, stomach, and face. But worst of all, my beloved 3WM t-shirt is in utter ruins (at least they got fed).  I can't afford to buy another one because of all the hospital bills, does anyone want to donate a 3WM to me? I will never buy rabbit from the internet again, I will stick to the live ones at the pet shop. I just need to make sure my Burmese python isn't roaming the house free when I bring the live one home... wish me luck!"
1.0,Almost bought it until I saw it has caffeine,"I thought that this was natural energy from the vegetables, but it has green tea in it.  Anytime something has green tea, that means that it's loaded with caffeine.  They almost got me but thank god that I read the ingredient cafefully.  The energy is not coming from the vegetables.  The energy is coming from the caffeine.  What a waste!  I want natural energy.  I'll just stick to my alkalized raw food diet."
5.0,My daughter's favorite,My 9 old daughter loves this and is her favorites. We make oats and sprinkle this on oats and gives great taste. Also as standalone we use with slightly warm mile and gives a good start to the day!
5.0,"Best Sherry Vinegar, period","This is the best Sherry Vinegar, in my opinion, for the price, on the market. It's not overly sweet, has just the right piquancy, and it's really my ""go-to"" vinegar for just about everything. A must have for gazpacho! Marvelous on salads! Yum!"
5.0,Excellent!,I really love the new grains breads!  I wanted to share that the cinnamon raisin bread makes the BEST gluten free bread pudding!! Try it with your favorite recipe!!
5.0,good cat food,nutro is a high quality cat food and can be got here for a very good price. save yourself some gas and let amazon ship it to you.
5.0,Great entertainment for your dog,I live in Canada and this toy is pretty hard to find up here. I ordered it from the US because I had heard how great it was. I fill it with kibble in the morning and leave it for my dog to play with. She goes crazy for it. The difficulty setting lets me put it to max so the food doesn't all come out in the first 10 mins. I bought 2 so I could give one to my mom for her dog.
1.0,"Nasty, fishy cartilage","I rinsed these repeatedly (read that this would help with the fish scent), but it didn't help. The texture is awful. We ended up having cereal, because none of us could stomach these noodles."
5.0,Delicious,Love this hot chocolate. Made with skim milk for a healthier delicious hot drink. Creamy and tasty. Will never go back to supermarket hot chocolates.
1.0,Not Good,I purchased this product because I am diabetic and am always looking for new sugar free items to try.  I just wanted to let everyone know that I do not like your product at all.  I hate it that I spent that much money for something that I just had to throw in the trash.  I have bought General Foods International swiss mocha and love it.  Guess I'll have to go back to drinking it.
1.0,Not So Great,"I bought this item April 16th, and have been using about once every week and a half, and last night the bottom seam busted, squirting pecan milk all over me, and my kitchen, and dumping the pulp right back into my strained milk.  :-("
1.0,Horrid tasting stuff,"I find this to be the most offensive-tasting substitute for sugar. It does not resemble 'sweet'. It's a strange taste that made me recoil when tasting it; and, I had to spit it out. Then it left a bad taste in my mouth. The price is expensive compared to other sweeteners. I will NEVER purchase this again. And will continue to use saccharin (Sweet & Low) as it comes the closest to resembling a sugar taste."
5.0,The Best Salsa. Ever.,"I wish this brand would go national. It is by and far the best salsa I have ever had. My mother-in-law mails jars of it to out-of-state family. Really and truly, it is the part of Texas I miss most. I could eat it for days on end.  The hot flavor is the better of the two, but we started our children on mild and worked them up to the hot. The texture and flavor are perfect for polishing of a bag of chips. In my house, we fight over the salsa bowl."
5.0,Excellent,THe product is great and hard to find. My dogs love them THe service is great. The Dilivery is very quick
5.0,It's Hot!,"I love Hot stuff and this stuff really works.  If your friends think they like hot stuff, give them some of this with no warning.  It's fun..."
1.0,Weird smell and taste!,"Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even ""grain-flavor"" like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.  Back to Gerber & EB for my son..."
5.0,"Tasty...vitamins aside, it's making me drink more water","Very glad I read the label...when I selected it from Amazon I thought it was an energy drink...it's actually an additive you put in your water to make your water an energy drink!  Actually very tasty...very reminiscent of Kool-Aid Fruit Punch flavor.  One long squeeze is good for me in a 1/2 liter bottle of water.  I do like that you can make it stronger or weaker to taste based on how much you add.  Needs to be refrigerated after opening...one more thing to take up space in my fridge, but oh well.  I notice I'm drinking more water later thanks to this, so that's good!  And if I'm getting more vitamins, well hey, that's cool too.  0 calories...has caffeine."
5.0,Amazing,These are the best fortune cookies I've ever eaten.  I would say less than 1% came broken and they were certainly NOT stale.  I liked them so much I've ordered another box!
1.0,the box tasted better,"I am a chocoholic. so, to see this new cereal that was all about chocolate got me really excited!  The first bite was ""Oooooh, so chocolatey!"" The second bite was ""hmmmm....chocolatey"" and the third was, ""is this cereal stale????"".  Seriously, after three bites, it tasted like stale cardboard, plain and simple.  And I never thought I would say this, but the chocolate-ness was almost overpowering.  Save yourself some time and just eat the box, it'll taste much better.  Nope, not a fan.  At...all..."
1.0,Unhealthy for your dog,"Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition contains mostly grains instead of meat. The main ingredient is corn which difficult for dogs to digest and causes allergy and yeast infection problems. There little meat that exists are of low quality. In addition, it contains chicken by-products which is ""a meal consisting of the ground, rendered, clean parts of the carcass of slaughtered chicken, such as necks, feet, undeveloped eggs and intestines, exclusive of feathers, except in such amounts as might occur unavoidable in good processing practice."" (AAFCO definition) It also contains chemical preservatives which is banned from use in human food and unnecessary artificial colorants.  Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition is unsuitable as a source of nutrition and should not be given to any dog. After reading up on proper dog nutrition, I have tossed my half-used 20lbs bag in the trash. Now feeding my dog ""Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul"" instead."
1.0,Possibly good coffee destroyed by useless packaging,"This might be a good coffee if purchaced fresh, but due to poor packaging I was unable to properly judge that assumption.  This coffee is packaged in unsealed (not airtight) bags.  By the time I received it, all aromatics had evaporated off, yeilding an aromaless (and subsequently, flavorless) cup of medium-bodied warm water.  Until Camano Island can come up with airtight packaging, it should be avoided."
1.0,Not Satisfied,"Bought this product and was very disapointed when it arrived. It smells and tastes like fruit punch, not like passion fruit. Will have to try out another product that has more reviews."
5.0,K Cup Lids,The lids work great and are reasonably priced.  I definitely will order more.  The caps allow me to have the coffee I love that does not come in the KCups and saves money too.
5.0,Tasty Nutrition,"When I first tried this I thought it would be a smoothie type drink like I would find in a retail Jamba store. Little did I know this thing was packed full o' nutrition! Great tasting, and a shot is all that is required daily. Great stuff!"
1.0,yuck,"Not sure what this is but its not like any curry I've ever had, anywhere.  Has a sour taste ,hinting of sick, that had to be brushed out and the smell . . .  Stick with whatever curry mix you use and skip this one."
5.0,Set it the way others say and it works great.,"I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear."
1.0,A little too strong for me,"I host conference calls all day and my voice is starting to crack. I ordered these in hopes of soothing my voice. I don't really have sore throat, just terrible allergies this year and constant talking on the phone. They are too strong for me and I hate I ordered the large box. I can't use them one after the other for sure."
5.0,Great Taste!,"I was kind of skeptical of this at first, mostly of the taste.  I have had instant coffee before.  This is very rich and yummy, tastes, just like coffee, not instant, but fresh brewed.  I love it, and knowing that it is benefitting my health is a huge bonus!"
5.0,Cornucopia WIldberry Chianti,Very good flavor as we have come to expect from the Cornucopia kits. Chianti being on the dry side for our taste wasn't a problem as we just back sweetened a small bit to bring it up to our taste.  We bottled before Christmas and shared with family and friends who kept asking for more. Noticed recently the Wildberry Chianti on the wine rack is in short supply already! Will have to order another kit soon.  Shipping from Amazon on these kits was really quick. As soon as it arrived I started it and another Cornucopia kit and they were ready for bottling within the 4 weeks suggested.  I would comment on if they get better with age but I can't seem to keep any of these Cornucopia brands on my wine rack long enough for them to gain any age.
5.0,Blooming Teas!,"The teas came in the projected time and even included a handwritten, individualized sweet note of thanks and also some guidelines to brewing and selecting teas. Much enjoyed."
1.0,The worst thing on the planet,"It's bad enough having to come to terms with the fact that you're on such a tight budget and so incredibly lazy/bad at cooking that you have to resort to buying Kraft Easy Mac in bulk amounts so that you can have something to eat at work - but to try to pass this ""White Cheddar"" flavor off on the public as if it's some acceptable ""flavor""?  For shame, Kraft. This particular variety of Easy Mac is by far the worst abomination to come to the planet Earth since...since White Cheddar Easy Mac. Yes, nothing is worse than this flavor. It is like pouring granulated bits of aluminum and chalk into your depressing boiling hot bowl of noodles and then putting aluminum and chalk in your mouth.  Me eating Easy Mac usually ends in tears, but this was actually so terrible I threw it out immediately and went to get a hoagie, because, God damn it, sometimes you have to just say ""NO! My life DOESN'T have to be THIS BAD!""  And if you're thinking of buying this flavor of Easy Mac, please opt for triple cheese like a normal human being."
5.0,Perfect!,This was great for my holiday baking. I made peppermint bark and it came out so good! I got rave reviews from everyone. I will definitely order more for next year!
1.0,Not Arcor brand!,"I received an imitation, made in Columbia SA, not Argentina, as ARCOR brand is. They are NOT the same. I returned the order and am ordering another item in the hopes IT will be ARCOR. Don't always believe the item page!"
1.0,Worthless!!,"Lots of good reviews led me to purchase this product. I ignored the bad reviews feeling that they were a minority, an unlucky few that ended up with a poor batch.  Well, here's another dissatisfied customer.  I used 1, 2, 3, and then 4 bags of this stuff and all it did was make me feel slightly like I had a cold.  If you are like me looking for a bit of a stimulant, forget it. As for the other health properties ascribed to this tea I'd say it's no better than cabbage."
1.0,What a let down,I look forward to buying these every year and what a let down this years shipment was.These make a very weak cup of coffee with just a faint hint of pumpkin spice. Shame on you Green Mountain. Not up to the standards i thought your company had.
1.0,Too Spicy,I was really excited about this product because pumpkin spice syrup is really hard to find in my area. It turns out that this stuff is waaaay to spicy for my throat. More than one pump leaves my throat burning.
1.0,Unpalatable,"I like many of the Dr. McDougall soups, but this has a strange, slightly chemical nasty flavor."
1.0,full of msg,Could not use this because it is full of msg which I am allergic to as are some of my friends. You should list ingredients on items like this.
5.0,Best Ever,"It all started when a co-worker and I found a trade show branded super ball in a forgotten box of office supplies. You know - you throw it, it bounces - it's all fun and whatnot. We got a coffee break's worth of entertainment out of it before we moved on and forgot about it.  Well, I never forgot about it. I jumped on Amazon where I found these bad boys (seriously, what _can't_ you buy here?!), and they shipped in just a few days. I brought the bag in to the office a couple weeks ago, just for fun. Since then, I'm quite surprised that we haven't gotten fired with all the crazy pranks and games we've come up with. From rigging them to fall when the door is opened, to hiding them in the mini-fridge for an after lunch store-the-leftovers WTF, we've certainly gotten every cent worth of entertainment out of these things.  Sure, we made up games to pass the time during rainy lunch breaks (I bet you can't bounce it from the whiteboard to the wall, off the window and into the trash can), but the situation quickly devolved into all-out war. Some afternoons start out mildly enough with a simple game of double-bounce into the coffee mug, but wind up with tables overturned and 250 bouncy balls flying at near-mach speeds to land squarely between the eyes of a hopeless co-worker. I don't care that you volunteered to implement the latest changes to the product at the last sub-committee meeting; when the super balls come out, there are no friends anymore.  At any rate, I don't know what you're expecting when you buy a bag of bouncy balls on the Internet for eight cents apiece, but trust me, whatever your plans, it's worth it."
5.0,amazing,"Not only does it help prevent kidney stones...it removes them! Have Warts? No problem! Unwanted Moles? Spray it on and Forget it! This stuff is like car dent remover for the body.  Lack or energy, Sad? Take a sip...get a good grip....give the concoction 30 minutes to synergize inside the Gut and you will Feel just like when you crawled fresh out of your mothers womb...Amazing!  Uncle claims this also works great on clogged drains, removing unsightly rust, potent insect Killer (including fireants) and can even be used to spay your pets. The new bottle design is now made of highly durable plastic...much more stable than the old Ruski plastik that would spontaneously combust or explode upon daylight exposure. The days of having to lock up your Naleczowianka are gone! Naleczowianka is harvested and bottled in Poland (country in Europe). Warning: After sampling the Naleczowianka Polish Jokes will cease to be funny and completely stop making sense. Since starting to drink Naleczowianka i have lost 45 pounds, stopped wearing shoes and have this urge to start my own talk show. Searching for the meaning of life? Well you just find it!    PS:  In All honesty highly recommend - Tastes great.  -Naleczowianka Fan"
1.0,this tastes terrible. .,This is terrible and does not meet the expectations.  I thought that I could add to water and it would give it a good taste but it was terrible.  Maybe it would be better with milk but I do not drink milk.
1.0,extremly salty,I was expecting cheese as it states. I can't even tell you how salty these cheese crisps are. I brought them in to my job has three different people try them and I couldn't give then away. Every person I had try said they were gross.... Please re think this product.
1.0,Misrepresentation,"Well, it finally happened. After many, many years happily purchasing products from Amazon, I finally have a complaint. I got ripped off.  As pointed out by the other reviews of this product, what is pictured in NOT what is being sold. I've never known Amazon to allow this type of shenanigans, much less silently consent to them after more than one customer complained.  Yes, I received a completely different product than the one shown and described. This IS NOT Log Cabin syrup. It is a knock-off. The price seemed compelling -- and now I know why. Like the other reviewer wrote, ""I should have read the other reviews first.""  I've become a bit complacent about that, frankly, because I've so completely learned to trust ""my Amazon"" to vet the products they sell. Heads up, Amazon, your ""slip"" is showing. I know you always intended to become the ""Wal-Mart of the internet"" . . . but don't ACTUALLY turn into them, okay?  Sign me,  A bit disillusioned"
5.0,I love this!,"I usually drink Click with water and ice in the blender. You'd think you have gone to your favorite coffee shop and got a frozen coffee drink! When you use the blender, there is never any lumps. I hope all of you Click lovers try it this way and enjoy it as much as I do!"
1.0,Most expensive drink I've had in a long time...,Today I was excited to try a natural cola with no calories.  The 6-pack of cans I purchased was $4.99.  I took one sip.  Dumped the can and will not be trying the rest of this stuff.  In other words I paid the equivalent of $49.19 an once.  (Based on how much I was able to stomach...)
5.0,Excellently Scrumptious!,"Rarely, if ever, do I write a review. But...I am a total snob when it comes to SeaSalt Chocolate Caramels, and I had to stop and let Ghirardelli know just what a perfectly tasty treat they created. So good. Such a great balance of flavors. The only problem I see is that now my weekly ration of sweets is going to be extremely difficult to maintain, because I LOVE these! Love LoVe Love! Thank you Ghirardelli!"
5.0,FANTASTIC,This is the best Rum Cake I've ever tasted.  The first time I had this was  in the Cayman Islands. To know I can stay here and still get them is even better!

5.0,The best chai ever,"I am writing on behalf of my husband who tried a sample pack of this chai and dubbed it, ""The best chai I've ever had.  Can you find me more?""  Boy did I ever and he is thrilled.  We also sent some as a gift to friends of ours and they love it too.  Love that you can get the extra discount for consistent delivery."
5.0,French Roast in a K Cup,"Green Mountain French Roast is the closest to Whole Bean or Ground you will get in a K Cup. I have tried nearly all the K Cup French Roast, and this is my favorite. It has the distinct flavor and smoky taste of true French Roast. You can consider this as a breakfast coffee with hot milk. I love it as a latte, or bolder after dinner. It will satisfy your taste for coffee.   Green Mountain Coffee French Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers "
1.0,They were terrible!!,"I had great hopes that this was the answer for my pasta cravings.  Wrong!!!  I bought a big box of 15 packs of noodles.  I did have great hopes with all the wonderful reviews I read.  I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed some more, but the smell was terrible.  I would gag from just the smell of them.  Needless to say they all went in the trash.  Even my dog wouldn't eat them and he will even eat dead stuff off the road (road kill) so you see he is not picky. Don't do like me, just order one pack until you see if you like it.  That was very expensive to throw away.  I tried several ways to make it work.  I thought I would never get the fishy smell out of my sink even after bleaching it, there was that fishy smell.  If you love the way fish smells this is for you but be aware of all of this before you order!"
1.0,Furniture Polish with an Aftertaste,"The Switch Orange Tangerine looked very promising. 100% juice, with some zippy carbonation. I placed it in the fridge, and let it get a nice chill. Hours later, I popped the top, and my wife and I sampled...  And it tasted like drinking furniture polish. It's not like we we're searching for derogatory statements about Switch. Here is how the conversation went:  Wife takes a swig, looks at me with eyes all googled. ""Yuck. It tastes like furniture polish.""  I take the can from her, thinking she must be insane. I chug some down. ""Ah, yeah...it does taste like furniture polish.""  We poured the remainder down the drain. If you enjoy drinking cold tangerine flavored furniture polish, by all means...  BTW, this drink left a nasty aftertaste...still belching it up."
5.0,World's Best Granola Bars,"Friends of ours who are field biologists recommended these to us.  They like them because they are natural and delicious and don't melt when you're out in the weather for long hours.  Wow! They are soooo good!  They are a bit pricey, but an excellent healthy splurge.  We have tried the apricot and almond one and look forward to trying the others."
5.0,Great Alternative to Soda,"I really liked this drink.  It provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet, sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind.  Despite containing apple and grape juice, it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises.  If you're looking for a carbonated juice, I'd definitely suggest this.  I'll be drinking it again."
1.0,lil devil,"Amazed at how much, a company can get wrong. It looks like lemonade...I received Pink Lemonade! not happy and wasn't told of any changes to my order."
1.0,"Fantastic Taste, unfortunate about the MSG, though...","I used to buy the big bags of these and eat them constantly, then I looked at the back of the bag and saw they used MSG in the cheddar kind, but not in most of the others. I ate chex mix as a healthy alternative to chips and other junk food so them using something like this basically had me switch over to another snack. You can have your own opinions about MSG, but I think it's lazy personally when they don't even have to use it but they do anyways.  They did taste great, though. Maybe if more people complain about them using MSG they'll release a new formula without it. And no, I don't mean take mono sodium glutamate off the label and replace it with yeast extract, or autolyzed yeast extract when it's basically just a different name for MSG. I'd buy them again if we got a no MSG formula."
